            "description": "On their way to Alabasta, Nami falls seriously ill. Trying to find an island to treat her, they come across a pirate ship run by a certain Wapol, whom Luffy sends waltzing off. Fortunately, they arrive on the winter island of Drum and, after a hostile reception to say the least, the inhabitants agree to let Nami be examined by a doctor. The villagers also inform them that the island was ruled by a Wapol, until recently. Luffy and Sanji take Nami to the only local doctor (Kureha), high up on a mountain, where they meet Tony Tony Chopper, a reindeer who became half-man after eating the fruit of the Human, and who is well versed in medicinal sciences. Alas, meanwhile, the tyrant Wapol has returned to the island, and a battle ensues in which Chopper joins Luffy\u0027s crew as a doctor.",
