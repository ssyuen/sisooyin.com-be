Chopper, Robin, Brook and Luffy will divert the attention of the Navy forces who have seized the giant, while Usopp, Sanji, Zoro and Lily will be in the Sunny\u0027s pocket submarine to free the prisoner. But Luffy\u0027s got a strong head because he\u0027s so keen to fight. However, despite this annoyance, Nami\u0027s plan works perfectly as they manage to free Panz Fry, but Vice-Admiral Momonga attacks Luffy to stop him. Zoro steps in to save his captain. Meanwhile, Shuzo, a member of the Neo-Navy, attacks the Navy ships and Panz Fry. Throwing the Straw Hat into the sea, he is miraculously saved by Zoro, who dives in to retrieve it, while Shuzo explains to Momonga the reasons for his attack. A former Navy Vice-Admiral, he joined the Neo-Navy to eliminate all the pirates swarming the New World and serve the ambitions of Z, his superior. Seeing the situation worsening, Lily decides to intervene and, using the powers conferred by her Demon Fruit, transforms herself into a giant to attack Shuzo, who is threatening the existence of her father and friends. But Sanji is there to protect her. The young girl\u0027s life is also threatened. At the same time, Momonga, reluctant to collaborate with a pirate, agrees to fight alongside Luffy to stop Shuzo\u0027s actions.",

The only thing that matters to him now is to begin his assault by attacking the first island he finds in the New World.

Smoker, who has accidentally borrowed Tashigi\u0027s body, soon believes that it\u0027s a kidnapping, and that one of the kidnapper\u0027s accomplices is hiding among their crew. On the pirate side, Brownbeard tells Luffy and his friends about the island\u0027s extraordinary history: the famous Doctor Vegapunk was conducting research on prisoners taken captive on Punk Hazard. But one day, one of his experiments went wrong. A huge explosion destroyed two of the island\u0027s three buildings, releasing a toxic gas. Smoker explained to his men that Caesar Clown, not Vegapunk, was solely responsible for this scientific fiasco. As a result, the \u0022guinea pigs\u0022 on Punk Hazard were abandoned on the island by the World Government, which refused to save them. Paralyzed by the gas, they lived for a year until the arrival of a mysterious figure who gave them back the use of their legs. They all called him \u0022Master\u0022 in gratitude. The story of Punk Hazard ends with a serious incident: in the third building of Vegapunk, a centaur one day asked the Master for help. The Master tested a new medicine on him. But the remedy did more harm than good: the centaur could no longer breathe, and the Master left him to die in the gas. This unfortunate event enabled C\u00e9sar Clown to devise a plan which, in the long term, would make him the world\u0027s greatest scientist, surpassing Doctor Vegapunk himself!",

These episodes were released to mark the second anniversary of the Toriko anime and the March 30, 2013 Japanese theatrical release of Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods. Characters from the various anime series take part in a gastronomic competition organized by the International Gourmet Organization (IGO) to win Carat meat, reputed to be the best in the world. However, Goku, Toriko and Luffy are tied. Meanwhile, Zoro, Zebra and Vegeta accidentally run into each other during the race and start fighting. At the same time Mansam, the Director of the IGO, begins to decide who will win the meat that Mr. Satan accidentally obtains. His rivals try to retrieve it, but only Mr. Satan remains standing in the arena. This feat makes him the lucky winner of the tournament. However, Mr. Satan decides to share the meat with characters from all three anime series, leading to a happy ending. But what they don\u0027t know is that the real purpose of the tournament was to attract the attention of a sea creature called Akami, also nicknamed the \u0022Sea Gobbler\u0022. This creature appeared in front of everyone and attacked Mr. Satan, Usopp and Gohan, absorbing their vital energy before leaving. Their companions then devise a plan to defeat this formidable enemy: the strongest of them will be able to capture Akami and eat him, as the animal\u0027s meat is very delicious. Some characters try to catch him, such as Sanji, Piccolo, Franky and Gotenks, but are quickly defeated. Akami then turns his attention to the most powerful contestants and ruthlessly attacks Goku, Toriko and Luffy. They must combine their powers if they are to defeat this fearsome monster together.",

Heedless of the extreme cold and the risk of damaging Nami\u0027s admirable body in which he found himself, the cook removes his coat to plunge bravely into the icy water to find Kinemon\u0027s missing torso. Nearby, Law talks to Mone to give Chopper, left alone in the laboratory, enough time to make an antidote to cure the children. At the same time, Luffy confronts Caesar Clown, holding him firmly between his elastic arms. But the mad scientist manages to escape by turning into gas. His joy is short-lived, however, when he discovers that the Straw Hat is immune to poison.

At the same time, on an uncharted island in the New World occupied by G-5 men who bully the inhabitants into taking whatever they please, some of them beg Rear Admiral Yarisugi for help in finding their children, who have been missing for three years. But this arrogant naval officer coldly told them that their children had long since died in an accident, and that there was no longer any point in searching for them, on the orders of his superior, Vice-Admiral Vergo, who had signed the expert reports. But what the parents of the kidnapped children don\u0027t know is that their offspring is alive and well and currently on Punk Hazard. Meanwhile, on the island, Caesar has managed to get his hands on the children Nami and Usopp had tried in vain to save, who were in the grip of madness. The Master of Punk Hazard managed to coax them back into his laboratory by offering them sweets. Not far away, Zoro\u0027s group is still battling with Smiley, who is furious after Kinemon dared to destroy parts of his slimy body. He decides to take revenge by sending them huge bundles of toxic sludge, forcing the Straw Hats to take refuge in Clown\u0027s laboratory. As they run, guided by the samurai who has regained all his body parts, our heroes are unaware that the rest of the crew, along with two members of the G-5 and Law, have been imprisoned by Clown. Indeed, Luffy, Robin and Franky, their hands shackled by chains made of Sea Granite, find themselves in the same cell as Tashigi and Smoker. Vergo and Mone soon appear to check on their health. Meanwhile, Caesar\u0027s clown soldiers carefully close all the entrances to their leader\u0027s laboratory, leaving the G-5 soldiers stranded outside. The latter find themselves surrounded by the various parts of Smiley\u0027s body, which reconstitutes itself to better attack them with its slimy mud. In the prison where the Straw Hat and his fellow prisoners are being held, Vergo and Mone discuss the Punk Hazard Master\u0027s plans, without knowing exactly what they are themselves. Smoker begs Vergo to save his men from certain death, but Vergo doesn\u0027t care. Tashigi\u0027s superior then realizes that his colleague has aided Caesar in the abduction of the giant children in the New World by falsifying investigation reports. This act hardly surprises Trafalgar Law, who explains to his cellmates that Vergo is not a trustworthy person, as he was once a pirate without faith or law. He was a member of Joker\u0027s crew, a fearsome forban. While Vergo threatens to kill Smoker and Tashigi for knowing too much, Luffy asks Law who it was, and the Corsair Captain confides that this \u0022Joker\u0022 works for the World Government, and reveals that this mysterious character is none other than the most feared of the 7 Great Corsairs, the infamous Don Quixote Doflamingo...",

Not far away, in the wreckage of Doctor Vegapunk\u0027s former Laboratories 1 and 2, Nami and Usopp watch helplessly as Caesar Clown arrives to take back the children. The two members of the Straw Hat Crew immediately realize that this man is responsible for the children\u0027s abduction. While the children are happy to see the Master of Punk Hazard again, who has promised to give them sweets, Usopp and Nami try to fight him off, without the slightest success. Using the powers of his Demon Fruit, he asphyxiates the two pirates in the same way he had done with Luffy, then forces the craving children to get rid of the two troublemakers who had sequestered them by beating them with huge iron bars and rocks. Believing their last hour had come, they are saved in extremis by Brownbeard, who everyone thought was dead. The ill-tempered forban had come to meet Caesar in order to exact his revenge and demand the return of his crew. Skilfully wielding a huge pipe, he tried to hit Punk Hazard\u0027s master, but to no avail. Punk Hazard orders the children to leave the ruins of the laboratory and take refuge in his airship outside. Nami and Usopp take advantage of the situation to pursue them, leaving Clown and Brownbeard to fight together. But the pirate is no match for the Master of Punk Hazard, who uses his Gas Tanet to bring him down. Luffy\u0027s two friends also suffer the same fate. At the same time, near the lake that divides the island in two, Zoro\u0027s group is still being pursued by Smiley on the way to the laboratory. Clown\u0027s slimy creature is getting angrier and angrier, and is reassembling all his scattered pieces to become bigger and bigger. Meanwhile, in front of Caesar\u0027s laboratory, the soldiers of Unit G-5 try to bazooka their way into the building to free Vice Admiral Smoker and Captain Tashigi, who are imprisoned with the Straw Hat. As they do so, they are startled to see Smiley\u0027s viscous body parts moving in the same direction as them. At the same time, inside the Punk Hazard Master\u0027s laboratory, Vergo and Mone are quietly enjoying a cup of coffee as if nothing had happened. Quietly, camouflaged under a half-open book, Chopper, who has found out exactly what Clown\u0027s drug is made of, tries to free Luffy, Robin and Franky from the cage in which they are locked. But a noise startles him and the little reindeer has to hide. At the same time, the giant children, who have boarded Caesar\u0027s airship to get to his laboratory, are begging for sweets from the guards accompanying them, and some of them are asking where their saviour has gone. The latter is quietly seated in his cabin and informs his subordinate Mone via snail phone that he has recovered the giant children who were buried with the Straw Hats without the slightest difficulty. For her part, Mone explains that the Navy soldiers are trapped outside the laboratory after having captured three members of the Straw Hat Crew, and that everything was ready for Caesar\u0027s little experiment to be immortalized for posterity by two Video Den Mushi. This news delights the Master of Punk Hazard, who can\u0027t wait to show his most loyal customers - including two famous Supernovae, Eustass Kid and Killer - his new weapon of mass destruction...",

At the same time, the children, aboard their benefactor\u0027s airship, are returned to the laboratory, where Caesar orders his subordinates to ensure that his restless hosts never escape again. However, Mocha, one of the kidnapped children, is overcome by hallucinations and mistakes one of Clown\u0027s men for a monster, gradually beginning to glimpse the sinister truth in which she and her comrades live as they make their way of their own free will to the Chamber of Biscuits. Meanwhile, in the debris of Laboratories 1 and 2, Nami, in Sanji\u0027s body, and Usopp regain consciousness. They realize that the children have disappeared and decide to find them, without worrying about Brownbeard, who is still unconscious. Not far away, in the private apartments of the Master of Punk Hazard, Vergo and Mone eagerly await the return of Caesar Clown over a cup of coffee. The latter arrives and is delighted to find his two right-hand men. He reveals that in the past he had made a deal with Trafalgar Law, now his prisoner, who had promised to give him his heart in exchange for Mone, Caesar Clown\u0027s beautiful secretary. But now everything has changed, with Vergo now holding the pirate\u0027s heart, which he tortures mercilessly before the horrified eyes of Luffy, who doesn\u0027t understand what\u0027s happening to his friend. For his part, Clown shows his prisoners the heart of Smoker that he has in his possession, until he is interrupted by Mone, who tells him that the broadcast is ready. On the video transmitted to the four corners of the island and several parts of the New World, where Clown\u0027s shadowy men are attentively observing the scene being broadcast, an enormous candy can be seen, which turns out to be the weapon of mass destruction concocted by C\u00e9sar Clown. The latter had christened it Shinokuni, while the Master of Punk Hazard tells his acolytes about the failed experiment four years ago which accidentally gave birth to his faithful Smiley. As he spoke, at the center of the ice island, Zoro and his companions were still trying to escape Smiley\u0027s toxic fumes, which continued to pursue them. In the distance, they catch sight of a huge bonbon guarded by Caesar\u0027s men. Caesar orders them to leave and take refuge in his laboratory, as it is not safe to be there.

Zoro and his friends, accompanied by Kinemon, witness this scene at the same time as Clown\u0027s men who, like them, start running at full speed to avoid being killed by their master\u0027s creature. The creature dies in the process, its remains spreading over the icy lands of Punk Hazard, whose scent reaches a sack of apples on board a wagon brought in by Clown\u0027s subordinates. As he breathes his last, Smiley loses his powers and soon one of the apples in the bag turns into a Demon Fruit. Smiley\u0027s body, meanwhile, metamorphosed into a poisonous gas that quickly spread across the island. In the confusion, Zoro\u0027s team and Caesar\u0027s men fled in opposite directions. On their way to their master\u0027s laboratory, they were exposed to the deadly gas, which petrified them in an instant, before the horrified eyes of Luffy, Robin, Franky, Law, Smoker and Tashigi, still captive. This horrific scene, transmitted via video snail phone, is seen across the entire island of Punk Hazard by Caesar Clown\u0027s shadowy men scattered across the New World and the soldiers of the G-5 unit desperately trying to penetrate Clown\u0027s laboratory. Meanwhile, in the wreckage of Laboratories 1 and 2, Nami, in Sanji\u0027s body, and Usopp come to the aid of Brownbeard, who is in a very bad way following Punk Hazard\u0027s lightning-fast master stroke. Lifting the giant pirate with all their might, Usopp begs him not to die. In a last burst of pride, Brownbeard listens to him and gets to his feet, determined to take his revenge on Caesar Clown, who had betrayed him. But soon, threatening smoke appears on the horizon, as Nami and Usopp look on in horror. Brownbeard takes it upon himself to save them by inviting them to ride on his back to Caesar Clown\u0027s laboratory, where the pirate\u0027s crew is being held. For their part, Zoro and his companions do their utmost to avoid being overtaken by the deadly gas, which is approaching dangerously close. They decide to run faster and see a strange dragon ahead, heading in the same direction as them. At the same time, Luffy and his friends, locked in their cage, witness their comrades\u0027 misfortune. The Straw Hat can do nothing to help them. Clown takes advantage of this situation to approach him and decides to experiment with his new weapon of mass destruction on his prisoners, while Chopper watches helplessly. Using a crane, he releases the cage containing his victims, which appears in front of Captain Tashigi\u0027s soldiers, still \u0022stuck\u0022 in the body of Vice Admiral Smoker, who had failed to enter Caesar Clown\u0027s lair. Suddenly, the naval officer sees the immense toxic smoke in the distance, and immediately understands that his end is near. This fear is not shared by Franky, Robin and Luffy, who take the situation in their stride. For his part, Trafalgar Law tells the Straw Hat to go ahead with the plan they had concocted together and explains that it was high time to pay Caesar back.",

        "description": "While Caesar Clown\u0027s shadowy men, scattered all over the New World, watch the video in which the three members of the Straw Hat Crew and the two Navy officers are shown captive, Eustass Kid and Killer, two important Supernovae, decide to ignore what was being filmed to concentrate on far more important things, such as forming an alliance between Kid\u0027s Pirates and those of Hawkins, another Supernovae. In his prison, Trafalgar Law decides to put his plan into action, ordering Franky to blow a large fireball at a destroyed ship outside to create enough smoke to hide the cage\u0027s occupants from view. Thanks to this ruse, the pirate regains his freedom, then explains to his cellmates how he had easily freed himself from his shackles. Meanwhile, he frees Luffy and his friends and gives Smoker and Tashigi back their bodies in exchange for their help. However, Franky must take leave of his friends to protect the Sunny, which was moored nearby. Meanwhile, Zoro and Nami\u0027s group are still running from the dangerous fumes of Shinokuni. They soon meet up and decide to join forces to escape the danger ahead. At the same time, Luffy\u0027s group manages to penetrate the laboratory of the Master of Punk Hazard Island with Law\u0027s help. The latter opened the large armored door to allow the men of Smoker\u0027s G-5 unit to enter the building, before closing it behind them to save their lives. But what the Straw Hat doesn\u0027t know is that his friends are still outside, in the cold expanses of the island, risking their lives at every turn by being exposed to Caesar Clown\u0027s weapon of mass destruction. Seeing their only chance of survival slipping away before them, Zoro and Kinemon combine their fencing skills to bring all their companions to safety inside Clown\u0027s laboratory.",

By sheer force of will, the Marine soldiers manage to seal the opening made by Zoro and Kinemon with their sabers just as the Punk Hazard Master\u0027s weapon of mass destruction spreads across the entire surface of the island. Now safe at last, the men of the G-5 unit threaten Luffy and his friends with their weapons and prepare to apprehend them. But Trafalgar Law interrupts their move, claiming to have found a way to escape this nightmare island through a mysterious passageway known as the R-66, located in the R Building. The Navy soldiers are reluctant to follow a pirate, but quickly change their minds when their chief, Vice-Admiral Smoker, forces them to obey the Corsair Captain. Smoker then orders Tashigi to take command of his men and rescue the children, as he still has unfinished business with Vergo, who has betrayed the Navy. Smoker isn\u0027t the only one who wants to answer to someone, as Luffy is ready to take his revenge on Caesar Clown. But before he does, Zoro reminds his friend of an important detail: they are now in the New World, where they must never let their guard down. Armed with this advice, Luffy happily battles Clown\u0027s Satyr soldiers. At the same time, Luffy is astonished to learn that the Straw Hats and the Navy soldiers have entered his laboratory together, and that they are safe and sound...",

All remember with emotion their comrades who fell victim to Shinokuni\u0027s deadly fumes. But the Marine soldiers were unable to mourn for long, as a mysterious dragon began to attack them, spitting fire at them. The soldiers are horrified to discover that this strange animal is invulnerable to their weapons, and can even crush steel with its teeth! However, Vice Admiral Smoker\u0027s subordinate does not admit defeat and bravely confronts their fiery assailant with her sword. Suddenly, the latter takes fright and flees with wings. The object of his terror soon appears before Tashigi\u0027s frightened eyes in the person of Vice Admiral Vergo. The latter is acclaimed by his men as their savior. But their joy was short-lived, for Vergo was no longer the man Tashigi had known in the past. Turning on his heel, he slaughters the survivors of the G-5 unit without mercy, using his combat skills to the full. Tashigi tries to defend her men against Caesar Clown\u0027s henchman, but is easily overcome by him. Just as Vergo was about to give her the final blow, the young woman, with tears in her eyes for having failed to protect her men, is saved in extremis by Sanji, who hits Vergo with all his might using his Devil Leg. Vergo is sent crashing into a wall, unable to comprehend what has happened to him. Just when everyone thought Sanji had defeated him, Vergo rises against all odds, determined to take his revenge. Meanwhile, the members of the Straw Hat Crew, accompanied by Kinemon who is still searching for his missing son, notice Sanji\u0027s absence. They are unable to take advantage of this moment of respite, however, as the dragon that had previously attacked the Marine soldiers attacks them in turn. Brownbeard explains to his new allies that the animal chasing them is uncontrollable and violent, and that the only way to subdue it is to administer sedatives. Spitting fire, the dragon attempts to injure Luffy\u0027s companions, but Brownbeard is having none of it, and runs breathlessly to outrun their dangerous pursuer. At the same time, somewhere in Caesar Clown\u0027s laboratory, Chopper comes to the rescue of Mocha, one of the kidnapped children, who is still suffering from hallucinations, knocking out the three guards who were trying to take him to his friends. The brave reindeer, understanding the little girl\u0027s pain, gives her a sedative to calm her down. Having regained his senses, Mocha agrees to help Chopper, and the two of them head to the House of Cookies to prevent the other children from eating Clown\u0027s tampered candy by blocking the door leading to it. Nearby, Luffy and Smoker finally arrive at the entrance to Building C, where they expect to find the Master of Punk Hazard Island in the company of Vergo. The pirate and the naval officer both enter Caesar Clown\u0027s private room, while he angrily orders Mone, who is worried about Vergo\u0027s fate, to open the passageway linking Building A to Building B so that Shinokuni can enter to petrify their enemies. But Luffy is against the idea and delivers a lightning punch right into Clown\u0027s stomach.",

Thinking he\u0027d make her fall in, the opposite happened, as it was Luffy who fell into the trap he\u0027d set for Mone. Mone laughed at him, telling him that the only way to escape this hole was to fly. Not far away, the pirate privateer Trafalgar Law begins to destroy Building D, where the SAD is manufactured, when he is interrupted by Vergo, who attacks him using his long bamboo stick reinforced with Combative Fluid. At the same time, in the Biscuit Room, Mone, who had gotten rid of Luffy, prevents Mocha from escaping with the candy from the Master of Punk Hazard Island. But her plans are thwarted by the members of Luffy\u0027s crew who, despite the absence of their leader and with the help of Kinemon, don\u0027t want the harpy to harm the frightened little girl. While Zoro and his companions come to Mocha\u0027s defense, Vergo has eliminated the threat posed by Law by leaving him for dead, but is confronted by Vice-Admiral Smoker, who has followed him and is ready to do battle with him...",

As she flees, the little girl remembers arriving on the island of Punk Hazard with another child her age, Sind, aboard a boat. She also remembers her encounter with the local master, who offered his sympathy and benevolence and swore to take good care of them. Back to the present: Mocha continues to run, while trying to reason with her comrades who are in a state of withdrawal. While she\u0027s running, Mone fights Zoro before abandoning him to try and kill Nami, Chopper and Robin with her spears. But her attempt fails when the fencer\u0027s pugnacity forces her to continue the fight with him. At the same time, Luffy and Momonosuke are still trying to get out of the garbage chute where they\u0027re trapped by trying to fly through the air. But Kinemon\u0027s son, exhausted, collapses, dragging the young pirate down with him. As they fall, Clown, quietly ensconced in Building R, watches the Shinokuni advance and the desperate flight of Sanji and the surviving members of the G-5 unit through cameras in every corner of his laboratory. He also observes his collaborator\u0027s fierce battle with Zoro. Nearby, Brook, Kinemon and Usopp continue to search for Sea Granite handcuffs while trying to avoid being caught by the toxic gases of Clown\u0027s weapon. Just when all seemed lost, Sanji and the Marine soldiers enter the Chamber of Biscuits and witness Zoro and Mone\u0027s fight. The newcomers immediately fall under the spell of the young woman, only to discover that she is in fact a harpy! Once the surprise has worn off, Caesar Clown\u0027s dangerous accomplice starts attacking the members of the G-5 unit using her powers. They try to counterattack, but to no avail. Then Captain Tashigi intervenes. After carefully barricading the only exit to the Cookie Room to prevent Shinokuni from pursuing them there, she joins Zoro, against his advice, to fight with him against the dreaded Snow Woman.",

        "description": "While Sanji and the surviving members of the G-5 unit chase after the children to rescue them, Zoro and Tashigi must face Mone\u0027s fury together in the snow-filled Biscuit Room. The swordsman of the Straw Hat Crew is very reluctant to fight a woman, and a harpy at that! Nevertheless, he remembers his previous meeting with Vice-Admiral Smoker\u0027s right-hand woman in Loguetown in the pouring rain. Tashigi bears a striking resemblance to his departed friend, behaving just as well with her swordplay as with her verbal jousting. He leaves Tashigi to fight alone against Caesar Clown\u0027s henchman, who uses the full extent of his snow-woman powers to defeat his opponent. Meanwhile, Usopp is still trying to shake off Shinokuni\u0027s deadly gases, taking refuge in a strange refrigerated room containing mysterious jars of frozen animals. At the same moment, Kinemon sees a bullet bouncing down a corridor before hearing the cries of children. Leaving Brook\u0027s emaciated body behind, he discovers a room where dozens of children dressed in white have taken refuge. Asking where his son is, he frightens them. Brook comes at that moment and provokes the same fright. But one little girl knows Momonosuke and offers to help find him. Not far away, Mocha continues to run with Clown\u0027s candy to prevent her sick friends, who are chasing her, from grabbing it. Nami, Robin and Chopper, who are behind her, help her by slowing down her pursuers. The doctor on board Luffy\u0027s crew takes the opportunity to administer an antidote to the giant children Robin had managed to stop with her powers. At the same time, at the bottom of Building C, the Straw Hat braked his vertiginous fall by clutching a hand to the metal wall. With his other hand, he managed to catch Momonosuke in extremis, who was unconscious as a result of his failure. Aware of his revenge on Caesar, Luffy puts Kinemon\u0027s son on his back and begins the ascent to the surface, using his fists to make his way along the wall. At the same time, in the Biscuit Room, the battle between Tashigi and Mone reaches its climax. Using all her sword-fighting techniques, the naval officer is powerless against the ferocity of the snow-woman, who takes great pleasure in sinking her icy fangs into her shoulder. Tashigi is in agony. Zoro, enjoying the spectacle, breaks his passivity to finish off Mone once and for all. Using the \u00cettory\u00fb technique, he cuts Caesar Clown\u0027s accomplice in half before Tashigi\u0027s stunned eyes. The snow-woman attempts a final attack, but is stopped dead in her tracks by Smoker\u0027s second-in-command, who kills her with a well-placed saber thrust. After the fight, the two fencers leave the Chamber of Biscuits, but just as they\u0027re about to leave, Tashigi collapses in pain before Zoro\u0027s eyes, who rushes to her aid. Caesar Clown, who has been watching the whole scene on a monitor, is not sorry for the loss of his faithful collaborator and hopes that all the members of the Straw Crew will make their way to Block R to find a quick and painful death in the toxic fumes of Shinokuni. The Master of Punk Hazard lets out a sinister laugh, unaware that at the bottom of Building C\u0027s landfill, Luffy is angrily beginning his ascent to freedom, carrying Momonosuke, still unconscious, on his back...",

But the children are desperate to force the little girl to give them the poisoned candy. She is saved in extremis by Nami and Robin, who each use their most powerful fighting technique to halt the children\u0027s advance. As for Chopper, he takes the opportunity to administer a sedative to bring Clown\u0027s guinea pigs to their senses. At the same time, in the Biscuit Room, a fainting Tashigi gradually emerges from her coma. She is startled to notice that Zoro is carrying her on his shoulder as she runs. Suddenly, she sees Shinokuni\u0027s toxic fumes seeping through the gaps in the door she had specially sealed. If the two of them don\u0027t get out of this adventure alive, Clown\u0027s weapon of mass destruction will invade the whole of Block B. Not far away, Mocha pauses in her run and stops at the top of the steps of a huge staircase. As she tries to catch her breath, she realizes she\u0027s lost her way. The poor little girl can\u0027t enjoy this moment of respite, as she is suddenly assailed on all sides by giant children who want to get their hands on the appetizing candy she\u0027s carrying. She lets out a heart-rending cry, which Chopper perceives thanks to his acute hearing. The little reindeer immediately rushes to Mocha\u0027s aid. Mocha is in a very bad way: her best friends Kombu and Biyo are trying to force the huge candy out of her hand. Chopper, Nami and Robin arrive on the scene and try to intervene to save the little girl. But other children appear behind them to stop them. Knowing that Clown\u0027s treats are bad for her and her friends, she struggles to force them to see reason: if they continue to eat the candy from the Master of Punk Hazard Island, the children will never return home to their parents. To persuade them to stop, Mocha sacrifices himself, under Chopper\u0027s helpless eyes, by swallowing whole armfuls of Clown\u0027s candy under the wrathful gazes of his comrades. The Straw Hat Crew\u0027s doctor tries to force Mocha to spit out the candy, reminding him what it is: a horrible poison. As strange pinkish vapors emerge from her nostrils, Mocha swallows all of Caesar Clown\u0027s candy, remembering the promise she and her friends made when they were all in the Cookie Room: to set sail when they grow up to find a treasure island. She also remembers her last meeting with Chopper when they were blocking the door to the House of Biscuits. The little reindeer had told her of Caesar\u0027s sinister plans, and that neither she nor her friends would ever return home alive! After seeing these images again, Mocha spits blood in front of Nami and Robin\u0027s frightened eyes. The little girl collapses at the foot of the stairs in front of her friends, who can\u0027t believe their eyes. Chopper also witnesses the scene, and can\u0027t help remembering the words he spoke to Mocha: if she and her friends continue to eat Clown\u0027s candy, they\u0027ll never reach adulthood, and will soon die. But Mocha doesn\u0027t want to die, and cries her eyes out. Chopper promises that Luffy, his captain, will personally take care of Caesar Clown and put him out of his misery. The little reindeer asks his new friend to keep all their benefactor\u0027s sweets in the House of Cookies until further notice, so that no more children can eat them. Back to the present: Mocha is prostrate and spitting blood in front of the giant children, who are astonished that such a delicious candy could cause such symptoms. Armed with a syringe containing the antidote, Chopper races to save his friend before she dies. The giant children have calmed down and watch in disbelief as Mocha dies. Suddenly, men from the G-5 unit, commanded by Sanji, jump on them to immobilize them. Luffy\u0027s cook explains to his friends that Vice-Admiral Smoker\u0027s subordinates know how to give injections. With their help, all the giant children can be cured, but this is not the case for Mocha, who is rushed on men\u0027s backs to an examination room where Chopper will try to save her in any case, so that she can one day become an adult. Not far away, in C Block, a huge explosion shakes the building before the stunned eyes of Clown\u0027s henchmen in protective suits. Emerging from the rubble, Luffy, who has wrapped Momonosuke, still unconscious, around his body, neutralizes his opponents using the Haki of Kings. Nevertheless, he lets one of Caesar\u0027s accomplices live, so that he can tell him where his master is hiding. Now knowing where he is, the Straw Hat begins his advance towards Block R...",

        "description": "Shinokuni, Caesar\u0027s deadly gas, is spreading in every nook and cranny of the Punk Hazard Island Master\u0027s laboratory. It even begins to fill Building B, where the members of the Straw Hat Crew, the surviving soldiers of the G-5 unit and the children are housed. Zoro, who continues to carry Tashigi on his shoulder, finds himself trapped by the gas. He is forced to turn back to prevent himself and Tashigi from becoming the next victims of Caesar\u0027s weapon of mass destruction. At the same time, Sanji and the surviving members of the Navy continue to vaccinate the children in need, with the help of Robin, who immobilizes the most recalcitrant using her powers. Not far away, in the infirmary of Clown\u0027s laboratory, Chopper encourages Mocha to hold on, despite the fact that the little girl has sacrificed herself by ingesting all of Caesar Clown\u0027s candy. At the other end of the building, Kinemon is desperately trying to find his son Momonosuke, much to Brook\u0027s dismay as he and the samurai\u0027s path is blocked by gas. Meanwhile, Brownbeard arrives at Block R, Caesar Clown\u0027s lair. He sees no trace of the master of the place or his subordinates. He decides to explore further, hoping to flush out his enemy. A few yards away, Usopp continues to search for the Sea Granite handcuffs he desperately needs to stop Clown. Suddenly, he arrives at a heavy door and hears a noise. Intrigued, he puts his ear to the door to get to the bottom of it. He has unknowingly discovered Caesar\u0027s hiding place, as he and his men in wet suits watch Brownbeard\u0027s arrival in Block R. Some of his subordinates panic as the pirate searches every nook and cranny of the building for them. This insidious appearance seems to upset their leader. Indeed, Brownbeard arrives at the entrance to door R-66, where he sees a skyscraper. He understands that he is being filmed, and uses this medium to inform his men, who have joined Caesar, that their new master is a liar and that they are in grave danger if they stay with him. Knowing that the pirate is on the first floor of Block R, Clown decides to go and meet him, escorted by all his men who are still alive. Brownbeard then sees the Master of Punk Hazard appear before him, complimenting him on his state of health. This annoyed the pirate, who let him know. What he wants is to get back his own men, who have been duped by Clown. Clown vaguely remembers them and coldly admits to Brownbeard that he had tried to help them by sheltering them in his laboratory, but that in the end they were Shinokuni\u0027s unfortunate victims. This revelation enrages the pirate. He tries to capture Clown with his own hands, but is unable to do so due to his opponent\u0027s gaseous state. Worse than that, Clown has treacherously administered a muscle relaxant that is beginning to paralyze Brownbeard\u0027s entire body, leaving him unable to tell his men that they have become Caesar\u0027s guinea pigs. His exasperation grows when he learns that it was Clown himself, not Vegapunk, who was solely responsible for the terrible explosion that ravaged the island four years ago. Exposed to the laughter of his men, the pirate tries to get the upper hand by attacking Clown head-on with his sword. Clown immediately orders his subordinates to shoot Brownbeard. They do so, and the pirate collapses heavily in front of them. Clown steps forward to deliver the coup de gr\u00e2ce, but is prevented from doing so by the arrival of Luffy, who delivers a powerful punch reinforced by Fluid. Luffy, accompanied by Momonosuke, stands face to face with Caesar Clown, then advances towards Brownbeard to check that he\u0027s still alive. For his part, Caesar Clown orders his men to get back upstairs before the arrival of the Straw Hats and the Navy soldiers who will soon be the future victims of his experiment. He also instructs some of his subordinates, seated in front of consoles, to communicate the progress of his projects to his shadowy agents scattered all over the New World. While Caesar is in command, Momonosuke remembers clearly who was responsible for the abduction of the giant children. It was none other than Clown himself (something Luffy already knew). Luffy learns from his enemy the true secret of Punk Hazard Island. It shouldn\u0027t even exist, making it the ideal place for his evil experiments, in particular the design of SAD. Thanks to this product, C\u00e9sar is able to design Smile, which has the power to create Zoan-type Demon Fruits ad infinitum. The moment of revelation continues when Clown confesses that the owner of this factory is none other than Don Quixote Doflamingo, who has the supreme ambition of providing one of the Four Emperors with a whole army of Zoans. Faced with this new threat, Clown tells Luffy that he still has time to abandon his plans if he wishes to save his life. In response, the Straw Hat, far from giving up, throws another punch at his adversary, promising to fight on, whatever the cost...",

        "description": "Caesar advises Luffy not to underestimate Don Quixote Doflamingo, for he himself is the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of this great pirate and of the Four Emperors who share the New World. But the Straw Hat doesn\u0027t care, and violently strikes the master of Punk Hazard Island, using the full power of the Fluid under the astonished eyes of Clown\u0027s men and those of Momonosuke, still transformed into a dragon. Caesar Clown was writhing in pain, for Luffy had broken his nose with his violent punch! Mad with rage, the mad scientist forces Luffy to cease all action against him and to apologize on the spot, as he\u0027s no match for Doflamingo, who\u0027s running the show in the New World. Seeing that he is approaching and intends to attack him again, Caesar uses his powers to suppress Luffy by hurling a jet of flaming gas at him, but the latter is invulnerable to his attack. Seeing that he could do nothing against him, Clown warns his assailant that his friends and Law won\u0027t get out of Punk Hazard alive, but Luffy doesn\u0027t care and sends another right hook that explodes his opponent\u0027s jaw. Meanwhile, in Building C, where the SAD is milled, Trafalgar Law watches helplessly as Smoker battles Vergo. The two Navy Vice-Admirals are of equal strength, and each uses the Combative Fluid to fight. But Vergo proves the stronger, and Smoker is no match for his opponent\u0027s speed and strength. At the same time, Shinokuni continues to wreak havoc and floods into Caesar Clown\u0027s laboratory, forcing Zoro, still carrying Tashigi on his back, to run for his life. The children, now recovered and escorted by Nami, Robin, Sanji and the surviving members of the G-5 unit, do the same, while Chopper remains at Mocha\u0027s bedside, who is in bad shape after having ingested all of Caesar Clown\u0027s candy. The little girl suffers in agony as the little reindeer forces her to vomit up all the sweets she has swallowed, with the help of a few Smoker men who have come to support the Straw Hat Crew\u0027s ship\u0027s doctor in his action. As he does so, his comrades and the Navy survivors head for the second floor of Building R, where the last escape route from Shinokuni\u0027s deadly fumes lies. Nearby, Kinemon is still searching for his son. He dreads having mistakenly sliced Momonosuke, who had metamorphosed into a dragon, while Brook, clinging to his shoulders, implores him to turn back, as they run towards the deadly gases of Clown\u0027s weapon. For his part, Usopp hears voices coming from the other side of a heavy metal door. He thinks he\u0027ll find the handcuffs he\u0027s looking for, but when the door magically opens in front of him, he\u0027s discovered by Caesar\u0027s men, who try to apprehend him. Meanwhile, in Building C, Smoker and Vergo continue to fight, each using their own powers. Unfortunately, Tashigi\u0027s superior is quickly defeated by the power and speed of his opponent. Law, who has seen everything, tries to intervene, but Vergo, who has his heart, makes him suffer horribly by manipulating his organ. At the same moment, Smoker, in a half-coma, remembers his last conversation with his subordinate, and straightens up to face Vergo once again. But this burst of pride is quickly suppressed by Clown\u0027s henchman, who easily knocks Smoker down. This risky maneuver nevertheless enabled Law to recover his heart, which Smoker had managed to steal from under Vergo\u0027s nose. Now that the pirate had regained all his vigor, he was in a position to take on the felonious naval officer who had hidden a snail phone in one of his coat pockets. Thanks to this device, he was in constant conversation with Doflamingo, and Law told him that he was about to lose his right-hand man, Vergo. But Vergo had not said his last word. Completely covering his naked torso with Fluid, he attacks his opponent with rage. The latter, with a single stroke of his sword, sliced him in two before the astonished eyes of Smoker, who had been following the whole scene. The sword stroke also cut through the tanks of the SAD, the contents of which threaten to spill out onto the two combatants at any moment. As he completes his battle, Law nostalgically recalls the battle at the summit of Marineford two years earlier, and how the new era that began with the death of Whitebeard will be his and that of the other Supernovae scattered across the New World...",

        "description": "Trafalgar Law\u0027s blow to Vergo\u0027s sword has left the island of Punk Hazard dangerously weakened and beginning to collapse in on itself. As Shinokuni invades the corridors of Caesar Clown\u0027s laboratory, the children, accompanied by members of the Straw Hat Crew and the surviving soldiers of the G-5 unit, head for door R-66 in Building R, the only way out of Building B, whose walls are beginning to crack on all sides. Under the effect of Law\u0027s shaking, the deadly gases from Clown\u0027s weapon seep into the room where the survivors of the Punk Hazard Master\u0027s experiments are staying. Despite their desire to flee, the children are terrified and unable to move. At the same moment, Zoro, still carrying Tashigi on his shoulder, arrives at the Marine soldiers\u0027 side, who are delighted to find their leader alive. But their reunion is short-lived, as they all have to flee before the threatening advance of Shinokuni\u0027s deadly gas. At the same time, in Building C, ravaged by the blow of Law\u0027s sword, Law puts his weapon back in its scabbard, while Vergo, cut in two, lies miserably on the floor. The felonious naval officer is still alive, and asks his victor for the meaning of his words. But Trafalgar Law no longer cares for him. Vergo, using the last of his strength, attacks his opponent from behind. Law sees him and uses his powers to confront him. Not far away, on the second floor of Building B, in the examination room where Chopper is treating poor Mocha as best he can, the ceiling of the room begins to collapse on them. The Marine soldiers accompanying the little reindeer beg him to flee as quickly as possible. Chopper obeyed, forcing his companions to carry the little girl on their backs, who had fallen into a deep coma despite the perfusions keeping her alive. At the same time, Law has once again triumphed over Vergo, cutting every part of his body into tiny pieces and hanging each one on a railing next to a tank filled with SAD that is about to spill its entire contents. Smoker, witnessing the scene, gradually comes to his senses as the pirate begins to walk away from Building C, which is about to explode. As he leaves the room with Tashigi\u0027s superior, Vergo warns Law that he is no match for Don Quixote Doflamingo, who is much stronger than he is. The pirate silences him by slicing his face in two before bidding him farewell. At the same time, on the second floor of Building R, the ceiling of the room begins to collapse before the helpless eyes of Luffy, Momonosuke and Clown. The men in the latter\u0027s service are crushed to death by the boulders falling on them. The same situation occurs on the floor above where Usopp is. He manages to flee on all fours, leaving his pursuers in his wake. Drunk with anger, Caesar orders his men left in the control room to open the valves so that Shinokuni\u0027s gases can invade the room where their master is. The latter finally reveals his true face, calling his subordinates the scum of the earth. However, his men carry out his order, and soon the deadly vapors arrive on the outskirts of door R-66. Clown\u0027s henchmen, present at the scene, take fright at the sight of Shinokuni approaching them. Caesar, who has nothing to fear from this weapon since he himself is made of gas, holds out his hands to capture all Shinokuni\u0027s power. He then transforms into a terrifying gaseous monster that continues to grow before the eyes of Luffy and his friends. By becoming the \u0022King of the Land of Death\u0022, Clown fulfills his destiny and makes his own men the first victims of his power. His actions were observed by his subordinates in the control room. They soon realize that they are Clown\u0027s guinea pigs, and that they mean nothing to him. Seeing that there\u0027s nothing he can do for the moment, Luffy entrusts the still unconscious Brownbeard to Momonosuke before running to Building B where his friends are. Clown is stunned by his adversary\u0027s attitude and boasts as he continues to petrify his men beside him. Their comrades, present in the control room, once again witness their master\u0027s crimes. Usopp takes advantage of the situation to urge his enemies to join his trusted captain, who is not known for betraying his crew. The latter, using Gear Third, turns back and runs to confront Clown, who continues to petrify his men. Stretching out his arms as far as possible and inflating his handles while protecting them with Weapon Fluid, the Straw Hat then uses the \u0022Grizzly Magnum\u0022 technique to strike down his dangerous opponent. The struggle is terrible and soon his hands, which have touched Clown\u0027s vaporous ones, begin to harden and petrify. Luffy doesn\u0027t let this bother him, however, and with his fury, he violently defeats Caesar, sending him crashing through the R-66 door, which shatters on impact. The Master of Punk Hazard Island finds himself hurled down a long corridor before the impassive, hate-filled eyes of the young pirate...",

His dazzling feat is relayed by escagocamera to the four corners of the New World, where the various shadowy agents acting on behalf of the Four Emperors and Doflamingo witness Clown\u0027s debacle at the hands of the Straw Hat. At the same time, on the second floor of Building B, the ceiling is collapsing. Soldiers from the G-5 unit are running as fast as they can, carrying Mocha\u0027s lifeless body on their shoulders. Chopper is at the little girl\u0027s bedside, urging her to hold on. Suddenly, the little reindeer hears Usopp\u0027s voice in the control room, telling him the way out of Punk Hazard: Building R. He sees Nami on the control screens, guiding the children towards the exit. He urges her to keep running, as she and her group will soon have reached their destination. As he helps his companions, Usopp hears Caesar Clown\u0027s men wailing around him, still reeling from the shock of having been betrayed by their beloved master. As Chopper continues to do his best to heal Mocha, who has been lifted by Smoker\u0027s men, the Straw Hat Crew doctor spots Brook in the distance, carrying Kinemon\u0027s petrified body. The living skeleton explains that the samurai had been exposed to Shinokuni\u0027s deadly gas and had died as a result. Brook tells his friend exactly what happened: Kinemon learned from a little girl that her son had turned into a dragon. Mad with grief, the samurai ran into danger and turned into a statue without Brook being able to intervene. After these explanations, Usopp, still in the control room, warns Brook and Chopper that Shinokuni is getting dangerously close to them. The two members of the Straw Hat Crew catch sight of him and immediately flee. For her part, Nami encourages the giant children to follow her to Building R, which is now very close. Accompanied by Navy soldiers, Nami and the children enter the second floor of the building. The young sailor spots Luffy, but also Brownbeard, who lies unconscious beside her. Momonosuke, still transformed into a dragon, is delighted to find the children safe and sound. He then realizes that the Straw Hat had kept his word, telling him that he and his friends had promised to rescue Caesar Clown\u0027s unfortunate victims. Meanwhile, Sanji, Zoro and Robin arrive at Building R, but they\u0027re worried not to see Chopper and the others there. As everyone congratulates each other, Tashigi fails to see his superior safe and sound with Luffy and begins to panic. Meanwhile, in the passageway between Building R and Building D, Smoker and Law drag a heavy empty SAD wagon towards Door R-66, with the aim of getting everyone into it to escape from the laboratory. When the two men arrive in Building R, the Navy Vice-Admiral is hailed as a hero by his men, who are delighted to see him again. Trafalgar Law takes the opportunity to speak to Luffy, asking him where Clown is. The young pirate boasts that he has kicked his opponent\u0027s butt. This news greatly displeases Law, who reprimands him for having preferred to capture Caesar alive according to the plan they had both agreed upon. At the same time, as Shinokuni has completely invaded Buildings A and B, his deadly gases seep into the Biscuit Room, forcing Chopper, the Navy crew and Brook to run for their lives to avoid being petrified. Their only salvation is to reach Door R-66, where all their friends are already. Nami takes the opportunity to check on Brownbeard, who is still in a coma. Meanwhile, before the confrontation between Luffy and Caesar begins, two members of Don Quixote\u0027s crew Doflamingo approach Punk Hazard. The pretty Baby 5, who is still reeling from the death of her last fianc\u00e9, coldly murdered by her captain, and Buffalo, who uses his powers as a Roto Man to fly and carry his colleague through the air. He even manages to disperse Shinokuni\u0027s toxic clouds. Baby 5 then sees a strange armed ship with the name SAD. As they prepare to land, they hear a thud from the tanker: something had crashed into it, and that something was Caesar Clown, who had been knocked out by Luffy. Baby 5 and Buffalo can\u0027t believe their eyes. Luffy immediately informs Doflamingo, who had stayed behind in Dressrosa to oversee operations, by snail phone. He asks them to retrieve Caesar and bring him to him, which they do on the spot. Doflamingo wants to have Caesar Clown at his service, so that he can make as many SADs for him as he likes. As Law and his companions are about to take the exit taken by Clown, Baby 5 and Buffalo see a strange machine strolling quietly along the deck of the tanker where the master of Punk Hazard had crashed. It\u0027s Franky, transformed into a robot to face up to Shinokuni\u0027s toxic fumes, who is astonished to see these two strange individuals flying through the sky...",

        "description": "As Baby 5 and Buffalo continue to approach Punk Hazard, glaring at the robot-like Franky, the latter begins to attack them with machine-gun fire. The two members of Don Quixote\u0027s crew, Doflamingo, are taken aback by such an act and believe they are in the presence of one of Dr. Vegapunk\u0027s Pacifistas. But Baby 5 doesn\u0027t give up, and organizes a counter-attack with the help of his accomplice. Launched into the air by Buffalo, the young woman fires dozens of bursts at Franky until she succeeds in destroying him. Meanwhile, in Caesar Clown\u0027s third laboratory, located in Building R, Luffy, Nami, Zoro, Sanji, Robin, Brownbeard, Smoker, Tashigi and the surviving members of the G-5 unit help the children board the wagon that Law had wisely brought to escape the island, which is collapsing in on itself. While Luffy, Sanji and Zoro wait desperately for the return of Chopper, Brook and Mocha, who have not yet arrived, the pirate corsair, who knows the bowels of Punk Hazard very well, tells Nami that by taking Gate R-66 they will reach a port where a tanker is moored, despite the fact that Shinokuni\u0027s toxic fumes completely cover the island. This danger does not frighten the giant children, who are ready to do anything to return to their families. At the same time, Caesar lies unconscious in the harbor where the tanker is moored. Above him, Baby 5 and Buffalo plan to take him back to their captain as quickly as possible, but their plan is thwarted by the awakening of Franky, who was not destroyed according to the intuition of Doflamingo\u0027s ravishing subordinate. Astonished by such a turn of events, they realize, to their horror, that Franky\u0027s robotic body hadn\u0027t been scratched in the slightest. After this moment of surprise, the Straw Hat Crew\u0027s carpenter attacks Doflamingo\u0027s two accomplices again, throwing his shield at them like a boomerang. This fighting technique exasperates Baby 5, who abandons her bazooka to transform herself into a weapon using her own powers. Before Franky\u0027s stunned eyes, the young woman turns her upper body into a sharp blade, while Buffalo grabs one of her ankles to send her accomplice, now a giant sword, spinning through the air! Using his abilities as a Rotating Man, Buffalo attacks Franky. Franky defends himself by throwing his shield at them, which is sliced through in a single blow by Baby 5. Knowing that his duty is to protect the nearby Sunny at all costs, Franky has no choice but to pull out his katana to fight his two attackers. He manages to rout them by strafing them again. But Baby 5 has not said her last word and turns into a missile woman. With Buffalo\u0027s help, she is sent to Franky. Despite his best efforts to detonate the dangerous projectile in mid-air, Luffy\u0027s friend is powerless to stop Baby 5, who wreaks havoc on the tanker\u0027s deck before Bufallo\u0027s satisfied eyes. As the snow begins to fall again, Caesar Clown comes to. He\u0027s disoriented and finds he can\u0027t move as if paralyzed. Thinking that all was lost for him, he hears a suspicious noise and notices that he was still carrying Vice-Admiral Smoker\u0027s beating heart, which Law had managed to seize. Moved by a nagging grudge, Clown is ready to take Smoker with him to hell, approaching a long stone spike so that the rest of his companions who are with him sink into utter disarray. At the same moment, in Building R, the door leading to the room where Luffy and his friends are staying begins to close before the frightened eyes of the giant children. Suddenly, one of them sees the devastating scent of Shinokuni approaching them. At this announcement, the Navy soldiers take fright and begin to climb in disorder aboard the SAD wagon where the children are already. Yet Luffy and his companions remain unmoved, unmoved by the danger unfolding before them. This astonishes Law, who doesn\u0027t understand their motivation. Luffy explains that they\u0027re not all there. In the passageway between Buildings B and R, Chopper and his group are still running from the toxic fumes of Clown\u0027s weapon of mass destruction. For his part, Usopp, still ensconced in the control room on the second floor of Building R, is doing his best to help his companions reach the room at Door R-66, where they will finally be safe. Caesar\u0027s former subordinates rally around Usopp after giving him the Sea Granite handcuffs he\u0027d come for. Not far away, Chopper, Mocha, Brook and the rest of Smoker\u0027s men run breathlessly to join the rest of their companions, who are waiting for them before the door that leads to them closes completely in front of them. Despite the rockslides and toxic fumes of Shinokuni, Chopper and his men manage to reach Gate R-66 in extremis, just as the other gate closes behind them to the cheers and relief of their friends. But time is running out, and Law brings them violently back to reality, urging them to board the wagon as quickly as possible. Usopp, who has joined the others, obeys while Brook shows them Kinemon\u0027s petrified body. Upon hearing his father\u0027s name, Momonosuke, still transformed into a dragon, can\u0027t help crying. Far away, in Dressrosa, Doflamingo receives an urgent call by snail phone. It\u0027s from Mone, who\u0027s still alive even after receiving Zoro\u0027s coup de gr\u00e2ce. The young harpy, covered in blood, learns from \u0022Joker\u0022 that Vergo and Caesar had failed in their mission and that Baby 5 and Buffalo had been ordered to bring the former Master of Punk Hazard back to him. Yet Doflamingo\u0027s greatest desire is to see the giant children who witnessed his failure perish. The latter, accompanied by Luffy, speed down the corridor that Clown had previously travelled down in their wagon. As they flee, Doflamingo confesses to Mone that there is another weapon responsible for the destruction of Vegapunk\u0027s first and second laboratories. It\u0027s the same weapon that ravaged the island of Pink Hazard 4 years ago. By activating this weapon at the touch of a button, only one person can survive this cataclysm, and that person is none other than Caesar Clown himself, since he\u0027s made entirely of gas. Mone, aware of the danger, stands precisely in front of the triggering device and is ready to sacrifice herself so that the tanker that was to be used by the escapees can also be destroyed. Accepting her fate, the young woman lifts the hood where the release button was hidden, while Caesar Clown, rejuvenated by his revenge, is ready to pierce Smoker\u0027s beating heart. As Doflamingo bids farewell to Vergo, whose head, dismembered from the rest of his body, is still cut in two, La Femme-Neige, in a last gasp of life and as everyone flees the island, which is on the verge of collapse, presses the destruct button while making a solemn vow that Doflamingo will one day become the Pirate King! As she does so, a huge explosion rocks the mountain, which is completely pulverized by the blast...\n",

        "description": "As everything crumbles around her, Mone prepares to press the bomb\u0027s release button. Meanwhile, Luffy and his comrades are speeding along the road to freedom in the wagon Law commandeered to escape Punk Hazard. Smoker and Tashigi are with the children and surviving members of the G-5 unit. While they\u0027re riding, Brook has a run-in with Momonosuke, still metamorphosed into a dragon, who is desperate to retrieve Kinemon\u0027s petrified body. He screams in pain as he recognizes his father\u0027s face, before the astonished eyes of the various members of the Straw Hat Crew. Not far away, outside the tunnel, as Buffalo quietly hovers over Franky\u0027s burnt body, Caesar Clown is at the height of his triumph: he was about to take Smoker with him to the grave by stabbing the Vice-Admiral\u0027s heart that Law had given him. At the same time, Mone was about to press the self-destruct button, thinking of the escapees trying to get away from Punk Hazard as quickly as possible. It was all in vain for them, since they were going to die at the same time as the harpy-woman for the sake of Don Quixote Doflamingo, who was quietly waiting in Dressrosa for the fateful moment of his sacrifice. A sacrifice that never comes, as Mone feels a violent pain in her chest. His young master, bored with waiting for Punk Hazard to be destroyed, can\u0027t understand why Mone\u0027s snail phone is still active. As everything collapses inside Clown\u0027s laboratory, Chopper does his best to comfort the children, who are afraid of landslides. Suddenly, a violent explosion is heard and Trafalgar Law explains to his companions that Building D, where SAD was manufactured, has just exploded. At the same moment, Mone struggles to press the release button, but her strength fails her and she collapses, while Doflamingo begs her to destroy everything and Caesar Clown, drunk with rage, stabs Smoker in the heart. Not far away, in the tunnel leading to the port of Punk Hazard, Smoker chats with Law, thanking him for returning his heart, which the privateer pirate had taken on Clown\u0027s orders. In a clever bit of sleight-of-hand, Law had given Caesar Mone\u0027s heart, making him believe it was Smoker\u0027s. His ruse had worked so well, he\u0027d had to give it back. His ruse worked so well that the Master of Punk Hazard boasted that he had in his possession the heart of the Navy Vice-Admiral! So by stabbing this organ, he had not murdered Smoker but his pretty secretary by mistake, much to the chagrin of Doflamingo, who wanted the Snow Woman to carry out her plans by destroying Punk Hazard. Outside, Baby 5 returns to her human form after overcoming Franky\u0027s robotic body. She\u0027s pleased with her work, without knowing that the Iron Pirate was still alive. The latter lets her know it by trying to crush the young woman with his fists. But Baby 5 has not said his last word. After trying to shoot him by turning into a Woman-Revolver, she gets help from her colleague Buffalo, who throws his lucky bazooka at her. The young woman aims at Franky and fires. A huge explosion ripples across the deck of the tanker that was to be the Punk Hazard survivors\u0027 ticket out. The survivors, led by Luffy, are still aboard the SAD wagon, speeding towards the exit. But the tunnel walls begin to collapse in on them. Blocks of stone crumble in their path, but Straw Hat\u0027s initiative and Zoro\u0027s fencing skills quickly get them out of this predicament. Despite this feat, the survivors are not out of the woods yet, as Shinokuni\u0027s toxic vapors, which have responded through the cracks in the collapsing tunnel, come dangerously close to them. What\u0027s more, once they reach the open air, Law knows they\u0027ll be exposed to the gases of Caesar Clown\u0027s weapon of mass destruction, which now envelops every corner of Punk Hazard. The only way to protect themselves is to create wind to disperse its dangerous clouds. Nami, who is well-versed in meteorological matters, immediately offers her help, while a distraught Usopp suddenly spots the tunnel exit. This worry doesn\u0027t bother Luffy, who can\u0027t wait to see the sun again. Meanwhile, back at Dressrosa, Doflamingo is getting impatient and wonders if Mone has carried out his order. So he decides to make his own way to Punk Hazard, flying through the air using his levitation powers without warning his loved ones, Jora and Lao G, who have remained on his island. As he flies over the sea, Doflamingo asks Buffalo, via snail phone, about his situation on Punk Hazard, having realized that not all its inhabitants had been exterminated. His crew member explains that he and Baby 5 are having trouble with an iron guard blocking their passage. Doflamingo orders him to take care of him, while assuring him that he was on his way to finish off the late Monee\u0027s work.\n",

        "description": "On the coast of Punk Hazard, Baby 5 continues to fire at Franky\u0027s robotic body, which doesn\u0027t shrink from his assaults. On the contrary, he continues to advance, even throwing his assailant\u0027s own projectiles at him! The young woman has not said her last word and angrily strafes her impetuous adversary. But her attacks have no effect on Franky, who boasts to her that he is the \u0022invincible Iron Pirate\u0022. This is too much for Baby 5, who counters with the help of Buffalo. Using his powers to slash and shoot flames at Franky, Don Quixote\u0027s crew member Doflamingo thinks he\u0027s won the game, but he\u0027s no match for the pugnacious carpenter from the Straw Hat Crew, who rises to his feet without a scratch. He even invites the Man-Whisper and the Woman-Woman to come and challenge him. Meanwhile, in the tunnel leading to Punk Hazard harbor, where the tanker is moored, the SAD wagon carrying Luffy and his companions continues to speed towards the exit. But the deadly gases of Shinokuni are hot on their heels. What\u0027s more, the tunnel they\u0027re travelling through could collapse on them at any moment. To avoid this, the surviving members of the G-5 unit and Caesar Clown\u0027s former men do their best to protect the children from injury in the landslide. As they do so, everyone watches Nami, who is the only person capable of generating enough wind to disperse the toxic fumes from Clown\u0027s weapon. Continuing to roll, Luffy destroys the boulders threatening to fall on his comrades while watching his friend. Not far away, Buffalo glares at Franky, who believes his two attackers are interested in his cola, even though they had come to the island to take Caesar Clown to their master. Launching a joint attack, Baby 5 manages to perforate Franky\u0027s robotic left arm after metamorphosing into a Sickle Woman. But her triumph is short-lived, as Franky seizes the Buffalo chains he had attached to the young woman\u0027s wrists and launches them into the air, demonstrating his new Gaon cannon weapon: the General Cannon! At the same time, in the tunnel, the situation is becoming desperate for the survivors of Punk Hazard: four Navy soldiers have almost lost their lives after being thrown from the wagon carrying them. They are saved in extremis by the giant children, while the Shinokuni vapors continue to pursue them. Outside, Franky savors his triumph: his new weapon has worked extremely well. Suddenly, he sees the lifeless body of Caesar below and wonders how the Master of Punk Hazard managed to get here. At the same moment, Baby 5 and Buffalo rise to their feet and are more determined than ever: they\u0027re going to get Caesar back, whatever it takes. Nearby, the wagon carrying Luffy and his friends soon reaches the exit. But they are still being pursued by Shinokuni. They see, to their horror, that more toxic clouds are blocking the exit! Sandwiched by this new threat, the giant children plead with Nami to do something to save them. Remembering the promise she made in the Chamber of Biscuits, the young navigator pulls out her climate stick and produces a wind strong enough to clear a path through the air. Meanwhile, Baby 5 steps in front of Franky to retrieve Caesar at the risk of losing her life. She is soon joined by Buffalo, who is also determined to finish Franky off. Suddenly, a thud is heard: the wind produced by Nami has had its effect and the SAD carriage with all its passengers has managed to get out of the tunnel, dispersing the dangerous Shinokuni fumes around it, before the astonished eyes of the two members of the Joker\u0027s Crew. They see Luffy and his companions\u0027 improvised means of transport braking in front of them before it derails. The passengers are delighted to see the sun again, and thank Nami for saving their lives. Franky is also happy to see his friends safe and sound, and calls out to them from the top of the tanker. Luffy, Usopp and Chopper are delighted to see General Franky in all his glory, as are Smoker\u0027s men, but Nami, Robin, Tashigi and the giant girls are less thrilled. Suddenly, Law sees Buffalo ahead of him and recognizes the pretty Baby 5, both in the service of the mysterious Joker. The latter also notice him and call the privateer pirate a traitor, since he had turned against Doflamingo by forming an alliance with the Straw Hat. Knowing who his real enemies were, Luffy and his friends notice that Baby 5 and Buffalo had fled, taking Caesar Clown with them. Usopp and Nami take it upon themselves to capture them. The young navigator, gifted in the art of meteorology, creates a storm cloud that blasts the fugitives, who fall like stones. Usopp then takes over, using his kabuto to launch a rather special projectile containing stones to stun Buffalo and Sea Granite handcuffs to neutralize Clown\u0027s gaseous powers. The three escapees then fall into the sea to the cheers of the Punk Hazard survivors, who are stunned by Usopp\u0027s sniper skills. Trafalgar Law is relieved and satisfied that his new allies have finally captured this dangerous scientist. Not far away, Doflamingo continues to fly towards Caesar\u0027s island. Nothing and no one can divert him from his course. At the same time, a mysterious individual on a giant penguin wonders where Punk Hazard is...",

        "description": "In the port of Punk Hazard, the men of the G-5 unit use black paint to demarcate a border between themselves and the Straw Hat pirates, and are strictly forbidden to cross it. This is against the advice of their superior, who considers their action childish and does not want his subordinates to sympathize with the pirates, who are their mortal enemies. Vice-Admiral Smoker then tells them that he has contacted the G-5 base, and that he and his men should wait quietly on the island for help. Meanwhile, Luffy chats with Brownbeard, who is now in fine form despite the Sea Granite handcuffs around his wrists. The pirate deliberately surrendered to the Navy in order to benefit from medical treatment that would completely eliminate the effects of the drug injected into him by Caesar. Brownbeard is delighted that the Straw Hat has been able to stop the mad scientist, who is tied up and half-frozen alongside Buffalo and the pretty Baby 5, who had come to take him with them to their captain, Don Quixote Doflamingo. For their part, Sanji and Brook are gathering bricks to build a huge stove that the Straw Hat cook will use to make delicious meals. This prospect delights the living skeleton, who is soon distressed to see Kinemon\u0027s petrified, lifeless body. Not far away, Usopp, with the sound of his whistle and the help of the surviving G-5 soldiers, coordinates the restoration of the tanker\u0027s mast, which had suffered as a result of Franky\u0027s violent confrontation with the two members of Doflamingo\u0027s crew. On deck, Nami is shocked to learn from Tashigi that the children will be handed over to the care of the Navy. This news doesn\u0027t please the young sailor, who had hoped to bring the children back safely to their parents. But Tashigi apologizes on the spot and promises Nami that she will help Mocha and his friends to recover, and that once they have fully recovered, they will be reunited with their loved ones. Not far away, Chopper explores a secret room in the tanker and, piqued by curiosity, enters despite Law\u0027s prohibition that the place is too dangerous. The little reindeer pushed open the door and screamed in terror when he saw what was inside. Scurrying away, he tells all his friends that Trafalgar Law is a murderer. Brook listens to Chopper and unintentionally knocks over the Kinemon statue, which shatters at his feet. The living skeleton quickly understands his blunder, which he immediately shares with Sanji and Luffy, who judge him very harshly. But this event is salutary, as the samurai everyone thought dead was in fact alive. This prodigy astounds the Straw Hats, as well as Smoker\u0027s soldiers and Momonosuke, who magically becomes human again. Luffy and his friends witness a tender and moving reunion between father and son, without the latter noticing that he is completely naked! Kinemon sees this detail and, thanks to his power, gives Momonosuke a superb kimono, which he suddenly collapses in front of. He confesses that he\u0027s starving and hadn\u0027t eaten for days. Meanwhile, Chopper returns to the mysterious room where Law is hiding. He orders him to come out and explain what he\u0027s done to the giant children. The privateer pirate calmly emerges from the room and coldly tells him that he has sliced them to pieces. Panicked, the little reindeer enters the room and notices that all Caesar Clown\u0027s former victims are in very good health. They tell him that Law simply removed the diseased parts of their bodies, and that it\u0027s thanks to him that they\u0027re doing so much better. Chopper seems relieved by this news, but worries that Mocha has not yet regained consciousness. His comrades had understood what role their friend had played and hoped with all their hearts to see the little girl recover quickly. They also remembered Nami\u0027s promise, but were saddened by Tashigi\u0027s unexpected arrival. Indeed, Smoker\u0027s second-in-command tells them that they are now under the responsibility of the Navy, a prospect they are not very happy about. Above them, Usopp savors the appetizing aroma of the dish Sanji is preparing and watches Franky, who is repositioning the tanker\u0027s mast with the help of the G-5 men. Suddenly, Usopp notices Nami pensively leaning against the rail. He approaches her and the young woman explains, without taking her eyes off the sea, that from now on the Navy will take care of the giant children. It\u0027s a wise decision, especially as Nami has great confidence in the female soldiers. Moreover, Belmer, her adoptive mother, was a respected former Navy officer, a strong argument for leaving Mocha and her friends in the care of Tashigi, who had promised her she would take good care of them. On the harbor, Sanji put the finishing touches to the dish he had prepared, totally inspired by the roborative cuisine of Emporio Ivankov, the \u0022queen\u0022 of the Okama. The Straw Hat cook holds up a bowl of piping-hot soup in front of Momonosuke, who stubbornly refuses to taste it. This attitude displeases Sanji, who is not pleased to see someone wasting food in front of him. But Kinemon sets an example by enjoying the other dishes Sanji has prepared, while assuring his son that he can trust the pirates who saved his life. Feeling weakened, Momonosuke finally agrees to eat the soup offered by Sanji, before moving on to other equally succulent dishes, much to the delight of Luffy, who doesn\u0027t miss a moment of the spectacle. The giant children, who were Momonosuke\u0027s companions in misfortune, gather, bowl in hand, in front of Sanji\u0027s cauldron to get something to eat too. Trafalgar Law, however, is not in the mood to celebrate, and talks to Luffy to ask his men to leave Punk Hazard immediately, as someone was after them. But the Straw Hat has his own way and prefers to continue partying and drinking sake with Zoro and Usopp, much to Law\u0027s dismay, who doesn\u0027t understand the young pirate\u0027s flippant attitude. However, only one member of the Straw Hat Crew is not in the mood to celebrate. This is Chopper, who is standing by the bedside of Mocha, who has not yet woken up. The little reindeer still remembers the sacrifice the little girl had made by swallowing all Caesar Clown\u0027s candy at the risk of dying. But suddenly, Mocha opens his eyes and sees Chopper crying. Chopper is overjoyed that his friend is finally cured and throws himself around his neck. Not far away, outside, the Punk Hazard Master\u0027s former accomplices are happily toasting alongside Luffy\u0027s navy soldiers and pirates. Law is silently observing the scene when he is pestered by Chopper and Mocha, who, fully recovered, thanks him with a bowl of soup. For their part, the surviving members of the G-5 beg their commander to return to the island to save their still-petrified comrades, since they now know the weak point of Shinokuni, Caesar Clown\u0027s secret weapon. The latter, swallowing his bitterness, doesn\u0027t understand how Smoker can still be alive. Far from these considerations, the Navy Vice-Admiral chats quietly with Trafalgar Law, who wistfully recalls his conversation with Luffy on the mountain. That conversation had taught him that the Straw Hat had a crazy plan to defeat the Four Emperors, who rule the New World unchallenged...\n",

        "description": "While the victory banquet is in full swing on the port of Punk Hazard, Smoker takes advantage of this moment of respite to have a quiet chat with Trafalgar Law, who confides in him that he had a discussion with Luffy on the mountain about the Four Emperors who rule the New World. Law was surprised by the Straw Hat\u0027s casual attitude: he seems to have no fear of these four dangerous individuals, who have acquired far greater territories than those once held by Whitebeard. Better still, Luffy is ready to join forces with Trafalgar Law to defeat the Four Emperors. In any case, the privateer pirate intends to use Luffy and his crew for his own ends. Not far away, during the banquet, the children play nicely with the surviving members of the G-5 unit, who try to lift them despite their enormous weight. All ends happily, as does Luffy, who wants to show everyone that he\u0027s the biggest eater on the island! While everyone is feasting and having fun, Law approaches the three prisoners that Nami and Usopp had managed to capture. He stares longingly at Caesar Clown, while Buffalo and the beautiful Baby 5 recognize him. For his part, Franky has completed the restoration of the tanker, which is now ready to welcome all its passengers. The crew of the Chapeau de Paille have no intention of using it, and ask Smoker to care for and return the giant children to their family. The Navy Vice-Admiral vows to do so, while the former guinea pigs happily board the ship. Once all the children are on board the tanker, the soldiers of the G-5 unit violently oppose the Straw Hats, painting a line on the ground in black paint with formal orders not to cross it. Still remembering the meal they had so heartily shared with them, Smoker\u0027s men hadn\u0027t forgotten who Luffy and his friends really were: pirates whose mere sight could shock a child! So they put up banners emblazoned with the Navy\u0027s sigil to try and hide the pirates from Mocha and his comrades, while chanting pro-Navy slogans and insulting pirates, who are treated like the dregs of humanity. This attitude greatly displeases the giant children, who cry their eyes out and can\u0027t even thank Luffy and his crew for saving their lives without a moment\u0027s thought for their own. On the ship, Tashigi, who has witnessed this scene, orders his men to stop their antics and behave like the worthy members of the Navy they\u0027ve forgotten to be by acting this way. The surviving members of the G-5 unit weep with emotion at their superior\u0027s words, explaining that they were afraid of becoming outlaws by sympathizing with pirates. This admission astonishes everyone, including Momonosuke and his father, who can\u0027t believe their ears. The incident ends with harmony restored and the mischievous laughter of Tashigi, who is delighted to command such men. At last it\u0027s time to leave, and the tanker carrying the giant children and a few escorting Navy personnel quietly leaves the snowy port of Punk Hazard. Clown\u0027s former guinea pigs bid a heart-rending farewell to their saviors and promise them, much to the chagrin of the G-5 men left on the island, that they too will become pirates when they grow up. Luffy and his companions laugh heartily, wishing them a safe journey, a speedy recovery and a speedy return home to their parents. Once their ship has sailed, the Crew of the Straw Hat also intend to leave Punk Hazard as quickly as possible, taking Trafalgar Law with them - much to the astonishment of Zoro, who was unaware of Luffy\u0027s recent pirate alliance with the leader of the Heart Crew. Everyone returns to the Thousand Sunny, which is ready for departure, including Momonosuke and Kinemon, who are on board. Franky takes his place at the helm, quietly awaiting orders from his captain, who takes a long look at the horizon. All aboard the Sunny have fond memories of everything that happened on Punk Hazard and their fierce battle with Caesar Clown. The latter is also aboard the Straw Hat ship, chained and closely watched by Trafalgar Law. As Luffy gives the starting signal and his ship leaves the desolate shores of Punk Hazard for good, Doflamingo continues to fly through the air, determined to reach Caesar\u0027s island whatever the cost. On his way, he spots a boat sailing nearby. It turns out to be the lifeboat of his own tanker. He lands on it and notices that on board are the heads of his two subordinates who were to bring him the mad scientist, as well as a trendy snail phone whose face looks exactly like Trafalgar Law! Baby 5 and Buffalo confess their failure to their master, who receives a communication from Law. Law is delighted that Doflamingo has deigned to show his face outside his lair, and explains that Caesar is with him. He wants to negotiate with Doflamingo, but Doflamingo laughs and tells him he\u0027s no match for him. However, Law has more than one trick up his sleeve, reminding him not to upset Kaidou, the King of the Hundred Beasts, who is one of the Four Emperors and would not be very happy to learn that Doflamingo can no longer produce Smile for him. He\u0027d definitely kill him if he heard the news. To avoid such an outcome, Doflamingo asks Law what he wants in exchange for Caesar, and the pirate\u0027s answer is not long in coming. All he wants is for his worst enemy to get rid of his Corsair title, so that he can go back to being just another pirate. Law also blackmails him, demanding that Doflamingo\u0027s resignation from the police force be made known in the next day\u0027s paper. This ultimatum provokes the wrath of the Master of Dressrosa, who curses Trafalgar Law\u0027s name in front of Buffalo and Baby 5\u0027s faces.",

        "description": "As the Thousand Sunny sails through calm, untroubled seas, all the members of the Chapeau de Paille crew are delighted to have finally left the horrible island of Punk Hazard. Everyone is enjoying the fine weather and going about their business. Chopper takes the opportunity to treat Caesar Clown\u0027s wounds, although his heart is not in it, while Franky drinks a whole bottle of wine without stopping. He takes the opportunity to tell his friend Brook what he\u0027d done after escaping from the cage where he was trapped with Luffy. Using his thrusters to lift himself into the air, he spotted Sunny\u0027s hideout and decided to move away from the shores of Punk Hazard when he heard the detonation Smiley had produced as he transformed into Shinokuni. Gaining the open sea quickly, Franky took the opportunity to go to the other side of the island to retrieve the Mini Merry II moored there, before returning to the port of Punk Hazard, where he had donned General Franky\u0027s armor, which is capable of withstanding the toxic fumes of Caesar\u0027s weapon. Brook was delighted to hear his story. He was drinking tea when he was pestered by Kinemon and Momonosuke, who are also on the trip. Father and son also want to taste Brook\u0027s tea. Brook is quick to oblige and clutches two cups, which they drink with pleasure. After this convivial moment, Kinemon explains to his new friends that he and his son intend to sail to the next harbor island that the Sunny passes. They could have left on the tanker carrying the children, but they didn\u0027t want to stay with the navy soldiers, as Kinemon and Momonosuke had to continue a journey vital to their own lives. So they asked Luffy\u0027s permission to stay on board until the next port of call. The Straw Hat enthusiastically welcomed them, as did the rest of her crew. Trafalgar Law, who also accompanies them, announces their next destination: Dressrosa, the lair of the horrible Don Quixote Doflamingo. At the same time, in Punk Hazard, Caesar Clown\u0027s former subordinates lend their suits to the surviving members of the G-5 unit, so that they can rescue their petrified comrades, still alive, who are still trapped under the rubble of Doctor Vegapunk\u0027s former laboratories. They explain that these suits are able to withstand Shinokuni\u0027s toxic fumes; and it was knowing this that their former master had asked them to take them off when Smiley exploded. He wanted to see what effect his new weapon would have on human beings! With these suits on, Smoker\u0027s men enter the ruins of Clown\u0027s old lair to rescue their missing companions. At the same time, Brownbeard, who has also donned a protective suit in his size, is pleased to have received permission to remain on the island to save the lives of his crew, who have been trapped by Caesar Clown. He tells Smoker, who remains impassive, and watches him leave in the tunnel that had previously been used for their escape. After the pirate has left, the Vice-Admiral notices a commotion coming from the port of Punk Hazard, where the decapitated bodies of Buffalo and Baby 5 are on display. Suddenly, Smoker\u0027s men see strange glimmers in the sky, and soon the heads of the two pirates are back in place as if nothing had happened. Suddenly, a third figure appears, causing terror among the soldiers of the G-5 unit. It was Doflamingo, who made his entrance by twirling his coat of pink feathers in the wind before Smoker\u0027s astonished eyes. Martyrizing his soldiers with the Haki of Kings, Doflamingo wants to know where Trafalgar Law and the Straw Hats are right now. The Corsair\u0027s cruelty is unparalleled, and he tries to pull the wool over the eyes of one of the soldiers. Smoker dislikes this method and lets him know by throwing one of his famous steamy punches. He then proudly stands up to Doflamingo, who seems to be taunting him. The Vice-Admiral, aware of Law\u0027s next destination, doesn\u0027t breathe a word to his adversary. Soon, a Manichean battle ensues between the two men, with Smoker and Doflamingo clashing in the air without holding back their blows. But Smoker is no match for such an assailant, who is about to give him the final blow. The men of the G-5 unit, loyal to their leader, try to come to his aid. But Smoker intervenes, preventing them from doing anything for him. At his wits\u0027 end, he is finally defeated by Doflamingo, who uses the power of the Fluid to overcome his adversary before the helpless eyes of the G-5 men. Meanwhile, on the Thousand Sunny, Luffy is intrigued by Law\u0027s decision to set sail for Dressrosa. The privateer pirate explains that he has important business to do on the island. Dressrosa is also the destination of Kinemon and his son. Nami suddenly notices that their boat is caught in the current. Law is quick to tell her not to fight it and to let herself be guided to their next destination. Robin takes advantage of this moment to let his friends know that Trafalgar Law had been communicating with someone by snail phone. The privateer makes no secret of the fact, and even mentions the name of the person he\u0027s speaking to, much to the dismay of Usopp, who shudders at the mere mention of Doflamingo\u0027s name. Law reassured him that this was the logical continuation of his plan, a plan that the Straw Hat crew, with the exception of Luffy, were unaware of. Trafalgar Law and the Straw Hat\u0027s plan is simply to form a pirate alliance to kill one of the Four Emperors. An ambition that confuses Luffy\u0027s companions. But Caesar Clown, who is keeping out of the way, warns his captors that they will soon be hunted down by powerful people. Sanji silences him with a violent kick that leaves the former Master of Punk Hazard knocked out. After this incident, Law explains to his new allies the content of the alliance: while Luffy and his friends had captured Caesar Clown on the island, Law had taken the opportunity to destroy the machine that produced a substance called SAD, essential to the ambitions of the shadowy pirates who swarm the New World. Law also explains that Doflamingo is the most powerful of them all, and that his main associate is none other than Kaidou, one of the Four Emperors, who is the person to be killed. Meanwhile, on Punk Hazard, the severely wounded Smoker is dying in front of his men. Doflamingo is about to finish him off when he is bothered by Aokiji, who has come to Smoker\u0027s aid because he is his friend...\n",

        "description": "While Smoker is at the mercy of Don Quixote Doflamingo, Aokiji appears. Aokiji asks the pirate to spare his friend\u0027s life, but Smoker refuses. Just as Doflamingo was about to deliver the coup de gr\u00e2ce, former Admiral Aokiji uses his powers to freeze Smoker\u0027s attacker. His blow is so lightning-fast that it stuns the soldiers of the G-5 unit, who are left stunned. Buffalo and Baby 5 can do nothing about it, and soon see their beloved captain transformed into a magnificent statue of ice! But Doflamingo is no pushover, and quickly breaks free of his icy shroud to face the former Navy Admiral with a smile on his face. As the soldiers look on in panic, the pirate steps in front of Aokiji, but instead of fighting him, he continues to advance as if nothing had happened towards his two subordinates, who are reassured to see him alive again. Before Doflamingo rides off on Buffalo\u0027s back with the pretty Baby 5, he asks Kuzan about his current status. He received no answer from him, other than a long silence that spoke volumes. After the pirate leaves, Aokiji orders Smoker\u0027s men to treat their leader immediately. While Doflamingo savors his departure from Punk Hazard, Kuzan is at the bedside of his friend, who is in very bad shape following his fight with the Corsair Captain. He tells him to beware of the Corsair Captain, who is an evil man. Reassuring him that he hadn\u0027t changed since leaving the Navy, Aokiji took leave of his former colleague after ordering the G-5 men to keep the interview a secret. Climbing back on his giant penguin, Kuzan in turn leaves Punk Hazard. Meanwhile, aboard the Thousand Sunny, Trafalgar Law tells his new allies about Doflamingo and his association with Kaidou, one of the Four Emperors. At the mention of this name, Kinemon and his son lose their legendary composure to such an extent that Momonosuke transforms back into a dragon, much to the dismay of his father, who no longer recognizes him. Law continues his explanations. He tells Luffy and his friends that Emperor Kaidou is a great consumer of artificial Demon Fruit, which Doflamingo continually delivers to him in order to increase the number of special-power users among his own crew. Thanks to this, Kaidou increases his power vis-\u00e0-vis the other Emperors who rule the New World unchallenged. But Trafalgar Law has a plan to thwart Kaidou\u0027s plans, and it begins with the capture of Caesar Clown on Punk Hazard, as she is the only one capable of manufacturing SAD, the substance that enables the creation of artificial Demon Fruit. If there was a factory on Punk Hazard, there\u0027s another hiding on Dressrosa. The privateer pirate is determined to find it and destroy it in turn. Law knows in advance that this is a risky business, as Kaidou won\u0027t be so easily taken advantage of. Dressrosa is also the destination of Kinemon and Momonosuke, where one of their own is being held prisoner. As he spoke, the samurai noticed that the sky was darkening and hail was beginning to fall on them. Realizing that this phenomenon was not normal, Nami immediately climbed to the top of one of the Sunny\u0027s masts after ordering Franky to prepare a Burst Blow of which he had the secret. The Straw Hat Crew soon see huge blocks of ice falling on them. As Usopp aims for a cloudless area of the sea, Luffy\u0027s ship flies through the air to the astonishment of Kinemon and his son, who can\u0027t believe their eyes. After this prodigy, Momonosuke is transformed back into a little boy as if nothing had happened, while Franky emerges from the bowels of the Sunny, extolling the virtues of the boat he had built himself. Momonosuke and his father are delighted to be on board, and Nami takes the opportunity to ask the little samurai if he\u0027d like to visit the Thousand Sunny. The little boy gladly accepts the invitation. The young sailor takes him on a tour of the ship\u0027s nooks and crannies and all its riches: a superb aquarium housing many species of fish, and Robin\u0027s library containing numerous books on the New World. After enjoying a delicious meal in Sanji\u0027s kitchen, Momonosuke is examined by Chopper, who confirms that he is in good health. As the sun sets and night begins to fall, the Sunny sails quietly on calm waters, all aboard ready to give Doflamingo the welcome he deserves. Suddenly, Kinemon loses his head and attacks Zoro with his flaming sword, calling him a thief because he noticed Shuusui, Ryuma\u0027s famous sword, on the swordsman\u0027s belt. Caesar Clown, who witnessed the scene, took fright, but everything returned to normal when Sanji announced to the crew that he had prepared pizzas. Kinemon, who had never eaten pizza before, was eager to try it. He suddenly notices Momonosuke\u0027s absence. Nami informs them that the little boy is taking a bath with Robin. Knowing this, Kinemon, Sanji and Brook jump out of their seats and immediately head for Sunny\u0027s bathroom, where they see Momonosuke emerging in the arms of the charming archaeologist, who was dressed only in a towel. The three men were immediately enraged to see that Momonosuke was taking advantage of Robin\u0027s kindness to the point of making the little boy cry. Nami, who had arrived just then, sets the record straight by correcting the three adults, much to the relief of Momonosuke, who immediately snuggles between the young sailor\u0027s soft breasts and calls her a princess. Caught under her spell, Nami invites Kinemon\u0027s son to spend the night in the girls\u0027 room, even though this room was originally strictly forbidden to men. Despite this incident, the Sunny continues on its way when suddenly a strange creature emerges from the waves ahead of Chapeau de Paille\u0027s ship. A mysterious individual is on its back. He announces by snail phone that he has finally found Caesar Clown...\n",

Punk Hazard is the first island the Straw Hats find in the New World, and is made up of ice lands on one side and fire lands on the other. The island also contains Dr. Vegapunk\u0027s abandoned research center, now used by Caesar Clown (a scientist of extreme cruelty) to produce SAD, an essential ingredient in the creation of Smiles (artificial demon fruits). Trafalgar Law and Luffy form an alliance to capture Caesar, and in the process attack the Grand Corsair Don Quijote Doflamingo. Doflamingo is an ally of Emperor Kaido, who is the real target of this alliance.",

        "description": "All the passengers on board the Thousand Sunny are fast asleep, including Caesar Clown, who is handcuffed on the ship\u0027s deck with Trafalgar Law. Only Usopp, Chopper and Franky are awake, watching the horizon for a possible attack from Don Quixote Doflamingo. As clouds obscure the moon, causing total darkness, the mysterious man riding the Kung-Fu Dugong decides to put his plan into action. Luminous balls fall from the sky onto our heroes\u0027 ship. The heroes, in a panic, don\u0027t know what\u0027s happening. Suddenly, the balls of light spring into action and start attacking Luffy and his friends. It\u0027s all a ruse, however, as the mysterious intruders magically disappear, to be replaced by an evil man called Breed, who has been perched on top of Sunny\u0027s mast. Using a rather special Demon Fruit, Breed has managed to retrieve Caesar Clown from under the noses of the Straw Hat Crew, who are delighted by this turn of events. Commanding an army of Kung-Fu Dugongs devoted to his service, he orders them to fight against the Straw Hat before attacking his ship, which is caught in huge whirlpools that threaten to engulf it at any moment. Law understands that the situation is serious, especially as the ship has become uncontrollable and seems to be inexorably drawn towards a strange island that is in fact a pirate ship! Caught up in the turmoil, Franky suggests that Luffy take the Shark Submerge III, which can carry three people underwater, to try and escape. The Straw Hat obeys his friend, taking Chopper and Trafalgar Law into his suite, who advises Usopp to be on his guard against a possible arrival from Doflamingo. Taking the pocket submarine out into the raging sea, Luffy, Chopper and Law, all users of Demon Fruit, risk losing their lives at any moment if their boat sinks to the bottom of the ocean.\nOur three heroes have spotted Breed\u0027s accomplices, the Sea Rabbits, swimming in a shoal. Luffy orders Chopper to accelerate the speed of their submarine to catch up with them. The little reindeer obeys, as he too wants to find out more about these mysterious animals. Indeed, these strange creatures remind him of the animals he encountered on his native island, the Kingdom of Drum. As for Law, he\u0027s determined to find out who their new attacker is, who\u0027s in charge of the sea rabbits, and whether he\u0027s really working for Doflamingo. Suddenly, Luffy sees the Sea Rabbits enter the hull of the strange pirate ship. They enter too, and find themselves inside the ship. Trafalgar Law is the first to emerge from the pocket submarine. He is soon followed by Luffy and Chopper. Law instructs his companions to keep a low profile, but Luffy is in over his head, shouting too loudly because he\u0027s too happy to be aboard this mysterious vessel. Our three heroes discover that it\u0027s in fact a huge aquarium with portholes overlooking the sea. They don\u0027t have time to linger, however, as they are soon attacked by strange animals all wearing strange greenish collars around their necks: sea rabbits, of course, but also other equally extravagant creatures, including a huge octopus that bears a striking resemblance to Surume. Each using the powers conferred by their Fruit of the Demon, Law, Chopper and Luffy battle valiantly against their adversaries to defeat them completely. Just when Luffy and his friends thought they had taken them all down, a Kung-Fu Dugong appears. Using the powers of Fluid, he attacks our friends. Le Chapeau de Paille takes this attack seriously and sets out to deal with him. After the victorious outcome, Luffy raises his arms in celebration. Suddenly, the Kung-Fu Dugong he had just defeated leaps to his feet and throws itself into his arms, as if reunited with an old friend. Indeed, this animal knows the Straw Hat very well, having already fought him when he was in Alabasta to save Princess Vivi\u0027s kingdom from the clutches of the odious Crocodile. Luffy is surprised by this outpouring of tenderness. Chopper begins to understand what\u0027s going on and reveals to his companions that it\u0027s the same animal they met on their Alabasta adventure: the Kung-Fu Dugong. Meanwhile, Caesar Clown, still handcuffed, finds himself behind bars. He orders his immediate release. Suddenly Breed appears and begins to abuse him. Caesar, unaccustomed to such treatment, wants to be handed over to Doflamingo, but discovers, too late, that his new jailer is not working for the Joker. At the same time, Luffy clearly remembers the Kung-Fu Dugong he met in Alabasta and seems happy to be reunited. The latter feels the same way. After fraternizing, Luffy shows his new friend some of the fighting moves he needs to master to perfect his kung fu style. Chopper watches in amazement. The Straw Hat suddenly notices a strange cross drawn on Kung-Fu Dugong\u0027s torso, similar to his own. His new friend, who is very sorry to have attacked the Straw Hat\u0027s ship, admits to having copied it from a newspaper to resemble him, and begins to explain. Amazed at the idea of one day becoming a pirate like Luffy, Kung-Fu Dugong set off on his own adventure, facing a thousand dangers before forming a crew of sea creatures with other animals. United, they set off for the New World. But no sooner had they arrived than he and his friends were bewitched by Breed, who incorporated them into his own crew. The dejected Kung-Fu Dugong confessed to Luffy and his companions that it was on Breed\u0027s orders that they had kidnapped Clown. Suddenly, a loud voice comes over the loudspeakers, calling the sea animals to attention. Their greenish collars begin to glow and, as one, they all line up in front of Breed, who makes his appearance. Paying no attention to Luffy and his companions, he berates his subordinates for their ineptitude in obeying his orders quickly. Not wasting a single second, Law asks Breed to return Caesar Clown, their prisoner, to them immediately. But instead, the latter taunts Luffy and Trafalgar Law before launching a lightning attack on them before the helpless eyes of their new friend. The Straw Hat and the Shichibukai dodge it, but not Chopper, who finds himself trapped with a greenish necklace around his neck! Breed orders the little reindeer to attack his friends. Unable to control his body, Chopper crunches a Rumble Ball which transforms him into an uncontrollable monster who tears up everything in his path. He starts attacking Law and Luffy, who try to reason with him, but to no avail. Chopper orders his friends to leave Breed\u0027s ship immediately. The Shichibukai tries to subdue him with his power, but Luffy stops him for fear of hurting Chopper. Breed takes advantage of this moment of inattention to muzzle his two adversaries by encircling their necks with his necklaces. Luffy and Law find themselves trapped and at the mercy of this lawless man.",

        "description": "Now at Breed\u0027s mercy, Luffy and Law must dodge the attacks of their friend Chopper, who has become uncontrollable. As he assaults them, the Straw Hat desperately tries to remove from his neck the greenish ring that Breed had put on him using his power, but to no avail. Stopping Chopper for a moment, Breed reveals his plan to Luffy and Law, telling them it was they he wanted. The young pirate refused to give in so easily, and tried to rebel, but his whole body refused to obey him! Like his comrade Trafalgar Law, Luffy is unable to fight this man\u0027s power, and must submit in spite of himself, becoming his slave. As Breed savors his triumph, Chopper suddenly reverts to his normal self. Stunned by this transformation, Breed falls in ecstasy before Chopper and can\u0027t resist the urge to hug and cuddle him. This strange behavior greatly disturbs the little reindeer, who can do nothing about it. Luffy wants to help his friend, but is quickly put in his place. To prevent Law and the Straw Hat from revolting against him again, Breed orders his \u0022pets\u0022 to place Sea Granite handcuffs on the wrists of the two pirates to nullify the effects of their Demon Fruits.\nLocked under guard in a cell with Law, Luffy despairs at the plight of Chopper, who is now defenseless against Breed. Never losing his cool, the Shichibukai discovers that the bars of their prison are also made of Sea Granite, which annihilates their powers. This observation is supported by the presence of Caesar, who is imprisoned in a cell adjacent to theirs. Punk Hazard\u0027s former master is also Breed\u0027s prisoner. He informs them that Breed has no affiliation with Don Quixote Doflamingo, working on his own behalf to build a kingdom in his own image. Eavesdropped on by snail phones set up all over the room where they\u0027re locked in, Breed overhears their conversation and orders Caesar to lie down. Breed then introduces Luffy to his new \u0022pet\u0022, Chappy. It\u0027s actually Chopper, whom this strange individual had disguised as a lounge reindeer. The Straw Hat bursts out laughing at the sight of his friend dressed in this way, and as for the latter, he\u0027s totally exhausted from the Rumble Ball he\u0027d taken to transform himself into a monster. As he tries to escape from Breed\u0027s hug, Chopper accidentally scratches his cheek. Such behavior is unacceptable for a pet, and Breed lets him know it by savagely whipping Chopper. Luffy suddenly stops laughing and sees the little reindeer slump to the ground. He begs Breed to stop correcting his friend. Hearing the word \u0022friend\u0022, the latter stopped his punishment and painful memories came flooding back. Despising the human species that had done him so much harm in the past, Breed confessed to Caesar that he needed him to create his new kingdom by making him Zoan Demon Fruits to turn all humans on the planet into animals who would be submissive to him thanks to the power of Peto Peto no Mi! But Luffy is not a man to be easily subdued, and lets him know it. His insubordination is quickly punished by Breed, who catches him with his whip without mercy. But Breed doesn\u0027t want to kill him immediately, as he wants to turn him into a slave devoted to his sole service. To achieve this, Breed takes the cell in which Luffy and Law are locked up to the floor above; then, after freeing them from their shackles and prison bars, places them at the heart of a huge attraction worthy of the greatest circus. Using the power of his Demon Fruit, Breed orders the two pirates to kill each other, much to his delight. Facing each other, Luffy and Law are ready to fight, while Chopper begs them to stop. Even the Kung-Fu Dugong the Straw Hat had known in Alabasta is no match for Breed\u0027s might. Breed savors his triumph alongside Caesar, who is still submissive to him. The young pirate and the Shichibukai begin to fight, using their most powerful fighting techniques. Breed is ecstatic. He forces the Straw Hat and Law to fight to the finish, much to the fear of Chopper and Kung-Fu Dugong. During their confrontation, the two pirates reach the stage where Caesar and Breed are standing and pulverize it in a matter of seconds. The former master of Punk Hazard takes advantage of this incident to tiptoe away, only to be caught by Breed, who has every intention of getting his hands on him again. He lets him go, however, because he wants to contemplate the bloody spectacle offered by Luffy and Law. But this is too much for the Kung-Fu Dugong who, with tears in his eyes, steps in between the two fighters. Breed brings him to order by abusing him harshly with his whip. But he understands what his \u0022pet\u0022 was trying to tell him: Breed brutally interrupts the fight between the two pirates, whose bodies instantly stop fighting. Kung-Fu Dugong is overjoyed to see Luffy still alive, whereas Breed wanted him dead. Suddenly, Breed had a diabolical idea: he ordered Kung-Fu Dugong to fight the two pirates to the death. Unable to fight against his will, the poor little seal had to do his master\u0027s bidding. Looking longingly into Luffy\u0027s eyes, he began to weep heavy tears of spite. The Straw Hat consoled him by forcing him to hit him. Using his Haki, the Kung-Fu Dugong administers a punch to Luffy\u0027s stomach. Luffy doesn\u0027t flinch, standing proudly in front of him. Still crying, the Dugong strikes Luffy and Law, who don\u0027t even defend themselves. While threatening the Kung-Fu Dugong with the worst reprisals if he didn\u0027t obey, Breed ordered him to throw the two pirates into the sea. Luffy, who knows what would happen to him in the water, asks his friend to carry out the sentence, and with a heavy heart, the poor little seal sends Luffy and Law into the sea before uttering a heart-rending cry of despair...",

        "description": "Chopper and Kung-Fu Dugong can\u0027t believe Luffy and Law are dead, having both been thrown into the sea. The little seal that the Straw Hat had met during his stopover in Alabasta is crying his eyes out. But he is interrupted in his sadness by Breed, who celebrates the victory of his \u0022pet\u0022 over these two \u0022useless humans\u0022 with a hearty round of applause. However, this apparent joy does not please Kung-Fu Dugong, who tries to hit his master. The latter subdues his rebellion by using his power, which suppresses all willpower in those afflicted. Kung-Fu Dugong, humiliated, tries to get up, but is mistreated by Breed, much to the chagrin of Chopper, who can do nothing to save his friend. The master of Kung-Fu Dugong suddenly remembers the little reindeer and can\u0027t help cuddling him, promising him a place of honour in his future kingdom. To achieve this, he asks him to forget the Straw Hat, a task too difficult for Chopper, who rebels against his authority by slapping Breed\u0027s face with his paw. All his \u0022pets\u0022 are shocked by the little reindeer\u0027s attitude towards their master. Breed doesn\u0027t understand his \u0022Chappy\u0027s\u0022 gesture, which finally reveals his true face. Tearing off the cap that Breed had put on his head, the Straw Hat crew\u0027s ship\u0027s doctor cries out loud and clear that he belongs with the pirates, and that he wants to live free at the risk of dying. This declaration rekindles distant memories in the Kung-Fu Dugong, who clearly remembers the words Luffy spoke when the little seal met him in Alabasta. For his part, Breed tries to regain his composure and punishes Chopper for his impertinence. But Chopper couldn\u0027t care less, as he considers the Straw Hat to be his only captain, to whom he has sworn obedience. Even though he was thrown into the sea with Trafalgar Law and had no chance of escape, Breed could never destroy Luffy\u0027s dream of one day becoming King of the Pirates.\nNot knowing what Chopper was talking about, Breed hit him with all his might, but the little reindeer was tough. He predicts that he\u0027ll never be able to create his ideal kingdom, because Breed doesn\u0027t make the effort to understand those around him for a moment. This incident reminds Breed of a painful memory: when he was abandoned at sea, aboard a longboat, by his own crewmen who criticized him for not listening to them. This reminiscence of the past provokes Breed\u0027s anger, and he whips Chopper mercilessly. Kung-Fu Dugong immediately comes to his rescue, while Breed catches his breath. He orders his Sea Rabbits to finish off Chopper and Kung-Fu Dugong. The latter, like good soldiers, obey him and attack the two unfortunate friends. They are suddenly stopped in their tracks and hurled into the air by an unknown force. Breed can\u0027t believe his eyes when he suddenly sees Luffy and Law alive and well, still wearing his greenish necklace. Breed also notices that the two pirates have picked up Caesar Clown, still handcuffed, who had tried to escape. Determined to get his revenge, the Straw Hat warns Breed that he\u0027s in for a rough time. The latter, who doesn\u0027t understand what\u0027s going on, tries to control them with his power, but finds, frightened, that he can no longer command the two men. Amused, Law explains, with a smile, that he and Luffy have discovered the Achilles\u0027 heel of Peto Peto no Mi. All they had to do was plug their ears and they would no longer be subjected to it. He had discovered that Breed\u0027s base was riddled with snail phones and numerous loudspeakers designed to transmit his orders. Law had realized this when Breed had ordered Caesar to lie down in front of him like a dog. The Shichibukai also pointed out that he had pretended to be controlled by his power when fighting Luffy. Luffy, on the other hand, had been totally manipulated during their duel. Not understanding what his friend was talking about, since he too had plugged his ears, the Straw Hat is ready to do battle with Breed as Law continues his explanations. After the Kung-Fu Dugong had thrown them into the sea, Law, who was not subject to the power of Peto Peto no Mi, was able to use the ability of his Demon Fruit to save his own life and that of the Straw Hat. Using two rocks to fool Breed into believing they had fallen into the sea, the two pirates leapt back to the entrance of Breed\u0027s base, where the Straw Hat submarine was moored and where Caesar Clown, who had escaped, was. Unfortunately for the former master of Punk Hazard, his escape attempt was short-lived, and he bemoans his misfortune to Breed, who doesn\u0027t care. Eager not to be fooled by such adversaries, Breed reveals the true power of Peto Peto no Mi by deliberately placing a greenish collar around his neck. Then, drunk with vengeance, he transforms himself into a muscular being who will make mincemeat of his enemies...\n\nOrdering his Sea Rabbits to line up in front of him, Breed gathers all his troops to kill Luffy and his companions. Coming down on them like a hailstorm, the Straw Hat barely avoids their attacks to avoid injury. While Chopper tries to reason with Breed, Kung-Fu Dugong gradually loses his nerve. As Breed tries to flatten Luffy\u0027s head, the seal comes between them, ready to fight his former master, who will no longer have the power to mistreat his friends again. As the Kung-Fu Dugong admits, through Chopper\u0027s mouth, that he and his people were no longer his \u0022lapdogs\u0022, the latter rise to their feet and, with eyes full of rage, are ready to correct Breed. For his part, Luffy is delighted by this turn of events and asks the little seal to help him take his revenge on Breed. Breed is furious and sees his former subordinates standing in front of him. Ordering one of his Sea Rabbits to join him, he spins it in the air until it creates a huge whirlpool that pulls everything in its path. However, Luffy and Kung-Fu Dugong are not impressed by his power and prepare for battle. Believing his victory to be at hand, Breed is stopped by his own soldiers, who struggle against the persuasive power of his orders. The Straw Hat and the seal take advantage of this moment to combine their forces in a dazzling punch right into Breed\u0027s stomach, sending him hurtling out of his ship and high into the sky. Breed\u0027s grip disappears as if by magic, and soon his collars of obedience shatter into a thousand pieces, much to the delight of Luffy and his friends. At the same time, aboard the Thousand Sunny, Franky watches the horizon carefully in search of his missing companions. For their part, Usopp and Sanji see a large wave, formed by Sea Rabbits, coming closer and closer to their ship before hearing familiar cries. They see Luffy and Chopper in the company of the Kung-Fu Dugong, waving to them. After this happy ending, it\u0027s time to say goodbye. As one of the Sea Rabbits explains the quickest way to Dressrosa, the Straw Hat warmly thanks Kung-Fu Dugong\u0027s companions for rebelling against their former master. They\u0027re ready to explore the New World for new adventures. Their enthusiasm is welcomed by Luffy, who wishes them every success as pirates.\n\nAs day breaks, Kung-Fu Dugong bids a fitting farewell to the Straw Hats, swearing eternal friendship to Luffy. Then, joining his companions, the seal sets off on an adventure. While Brook is lost in contemplation of the pirate animals, a Postman Martin brings them the morning paper, which contains a very interesting article: the pirate Don Quixote Doflamingo is giving up his title of Chief Corsair as he had promised Law, renouncing at the same time the throne of Dressrosa he had held for ten years. While the members of the Straw Hat Crew, Kinemon and Momonosuke are still reeling from the news, Trafalgar Law is happy that his opponent has made the right choice. But there\u0027s another article that catches his eye, featuring his photo and that of Luffy. According to the article, Trafalgar Law and the Straw Hat have formed a pirate alliance, and they\u0027re not the only ones to have done so. Indeed, in various parts of the world, the planet\u0027s inhabitants learn to their horror that pirates Eustass Kidd, Scratchmen Apoo and Basil Hawkins are also forming an alliance to thwart the power of the Navy. However, Trafalgar Law is only interested in one thing: ruining Doflamingo\u0027s plans, and that began with the capture of Caesar Clown at Punk Hazard. At the same time, in Dressrosa, Doflamingo\u0027s subjects despair at their sovereign\u0027s decision to renounce the throne. Doflamingo listens quietly to music, oblivious to the sadness of his people and the noise of the many snails in his palace. Yet only one attracts his attention. It\u0027s the snailophone bearing the effigy of Trafalgar Law, who is desperately trying to reach him. The former Shichibukai picks up the receiver and quietly confirms his decision to renounce his title of Chief Corsair for good...",

The men who have been pestering the blind man get angry and tell him that this is none of his business. However, the mysterious man thanks Luffy for his frankness, and just as the thugs are about to lay their hands on the Straw Hat, he pulls a sword from his cane and forms a giant dark hole in the floor, knocking several of his opponents into it!\nAll the restaurant\u0027s customers are stunned by the power of this blind man. The crew soon realize that this strange individual possesses the powers of a Demon Fruit. Luffy, for his part, immediately asks him for his identity, but the man laughs and tells him it would be better not to answer his question, for everyone\u0027s sake. After the old man leaves the restaurant, all the customers panic when they see that items belonging to them have disappeared, including Zoro\u0027s Shuusui, the treasure of the Land of Wa, according to Kinemon.

The latter doesn\u0027t seem to know anything about the Smiles factory, but claims that his superiors are at the Coliseum Corrida, where a big event is due to take place and an incredible prize will be awarded to the winner.

Guided by an employee of the Colis\u00e9e Corrida, the Straw Hat enters a sort of waiting room where he watches the other gladiators train. One of them, Spartan, gets angry at the sight of Luffy, whom he considers a weakling, and attacks him. Luffy easily dodges his punch thanks to his Observation Haki, then gives him an arm lock before throwing him to the ground before the stunned eyes of the other competitors.\nAfter this feat, Luffy narrowly escapes elimination thanks to the intervention of the Ka Country Gang, the Chinjao Family (Boo, Xai and Don Chinjao), who certify that it was indeed Spartan who had started the fight and that he should be disqualified. The Straw Hat thanks his new friends for helping him, but Xai rejects his gratitude and tries to attack him before he is overpowered by his acolytes. One by one, famous warriors from every known country and organization are introduced, including Bobby and Kerry Funk, nicknamed the Funk Brothers, notorious assassins from a neighboring kingdom, and Dagama, a famous military strategist from the Kingdom of Prodense, who accompanies his sovereign, King Elizabello II, or Suleyman, \u0022the Neckbreaker\u0022, who must be wary of both Abdullah and Jeet, two infamous bounty hunters, and Orombus, the admiral of a large naval fleet, who have also come to compete for the Mera Mera no Mi. Among these illustrious participants is Bellamy the Hyena, who makes a comeback after everyone thought he was dead.\nIn front of a raucous audience, Gats explains the rules of the game to the Coliseum Corrida spectators: the 550 competitors have been divided into four distinct groups, from A to D, and a battle royale will be organized in each of these blocks where only one person can emerge victorious. Luffy is in group C. As he dons a suit of armor, the Straw Hat spots the status of Kyros, the strongest gladiator in the Coliseum Corrida. Suddenly, the notorious pirate Cavendish makes his entrance, causing the entire female staff of the Coliseum Corrida to succumb in his wake. As he contemplates \u0022Lucy\u0022, who had prepared for battle, the \u0022Magnificent Rookie\u0022 calmly confesses that it will be he and only he who wins the fabulous prize: the Mera Mera no Mi, the Demon Fruit that once belonged to Ace with the Burning Fists...",

At the same time, Rebecca, a beautiful gladiatrix, makes her appearance. Luffy makes her acquaintance as he carefully examines the magnificent statue of Kyros, the strongest fighter the Coliseum Corrida has ever known. The young woman, who is delighted that Lucy has beaten Spartan, explains the legend of Kyros. He is the strongest gladiator in Dressrosa, victorious in 3,000 fights and wounded only once. Participating in Block D, Rebecca, who is mocked by the other gladiators, has every intention of winning the tournament and the Mera Mera no Mi in order to kill Doflamingo with her own hands!\nMeanwhile, in the arena, the Battle Royale of Block A takes place and the name of the winner is revealed by Gats: it\u0027s \u0022The Masked Man, Mr. Store\u0022.

But the Lightning Fury soldier takes Franky to a secluded spot so they can discuss the cyborg\u0027s \u0022work\u0022. At the same time, a Marine soldier, hiding in the shadows, begins to panic, indicating that he needs reinforcements because the competitors\u0027 power has exceeded his expectations.

Bartolomeo, who arrived second to last, does his utmost to provoke the crowd, who, at their wits\u0027 end, throw garbage on the battle site before Bellamy makes his entrance to the cheers of the audience. This pirate, Dressrosa\u0027s favorite, is the final participant in Group B. Among the other competitors are fighters from the Kingdom of Prodense, including Dagama and other warriors who have been bribed to defend the brawling King Elizaberro II in order to increase his chances of capturing the Mera Mera no Mi. Meanwhile, other gladiators such as Jao-Kun Do, Blue Gilly, Tank Lepanto, Abdullah, Jeet and Hack, a Man-Fish expert in martial arts, are fighting as one after another is eliminated and falls into the water surrounding the Colosseum arena: infested with dangerous Fighting Fish, the arena\u0027s specialty. While Bellamy uses his powers to defeat his opponents, Bartolomeo lies quietly on the ground, content to watch the various warriors fight each other to the booing of the audience.\nWhile they wait their turn, Luffy and Cavendish watch the Battle Royale of Block B. \u0022The White Stallion\u0022 wonders why none of the rookies from \u0022The Worst Generation\u0022 have shown up so far.

Luckily, Chinjao\u0027s grandsons Xai and Boo intervene in time to prevent their grandfather from being disqualified before the fight begins. They persuade him to wait and stay focused on \u0022their real objective\u0022; especially as Luffy is also with them in C Block, they\u0027ll have the chance to kill him once the battle begins. Cavendish, however, has no intention of letting things go that way, and intends to kill the Straw Hat before the battle begins. So he sets out to hunt him down, but the Straw Hat hides outside, suspended under the grandstand windows, where he can follow the progress of the Battle Royale in Block B.\nThis one continues with the same intensity: about half the fighters have been eliminated and only 70 remain standing in the ring. Hack, the Fish Man, easily overcomes his eighteenth opponent, who was armed with a club, while Ricky triumphs over all his foes with disconcerting ease and even matches the Fish Man\u0027s score, before the stunned eyes of the Colis\u00e9e Corrida audience and Gats. Not far away, the duo of criminals, Abdullah and Jeet, have defeated ten opponents in one go, and attempt to attack Tank Lepanto, who is valiantly protecting Elizabello II as he warms up. At the same time, Blue Gilly bravely defies the King of Prodence\u0027s bodyguard, much to Dagama\u0027s dismay. The latter suddenly sees his comrade Tank struck down by Abdullah and Jeet without being able to intervene. However, the two assailants of the Dressrosa Defense Army squadron commander are in turn eliminated by Bellamy to the cheers of a cheering crowd. Meanwhile, uninterested in the fighting going on around him, Bartolomeo quietly urinates in the arena water infested with Fighting Fish. Hack, who is supported by the audience because of his incredible strength, comes to challenge him and attacks him from behind. Against all odds, his action had no effect, as a strange invisible barrier appeared behind Bartolomeo and protected him. However, Hack\u0027s hand was badly injured and the Fishman was soon on the ground in agony. Everyone (including Luffy) is shocked and confused by what has just happened before their very eyes...",

Bellamy faces Bartolomeo while Blue Gilly defeats Ricky. The corrupt fighters protecting King Elizabello II are attacked by Blue Gilly from behind, then stabbed by Dagama, who then reveals his cooperation with the Long-Legged One all along. However, when the latter\u0027s back is turned, the military strategist tries to take advantage of the situation to eliminate him too. But Blue Gilly, who saw it coming, immediately attacks and eliminates him, much to the despair of King Elizabello II, who is still warming up to his Royal Punch after having curtly declared that he never trusted his former accomplice. At the same moment, Bellamy launches a dazzling attack on Bartolomeo but finds himself in great difficulty against him, while Elizabello is ready to unleash his devastating punch. The audience begins to wonder about the rumors concerning the King, who had destroyed an enemy fortress with a single punch!\nMeanwhile, Franky and Soldier Lightning Fury are having a discussion about the Smile Factory when the ground begins to shake! King Elizabello II is the cause of this tremor, as he is about to unleash his Royal Punch. The spectators at the Colis\u00e9e Corrida take fright and flee the stands to avoid injury. Just as Blue Gilly is about to attack the ruler of the Kingdom of Prodence, the latter releases his devastating blow, creating a huge shockwave that shakes everything in the ring and shakes the Colosseum to its foundations. After the smoke has cleared, Elizabello is still present, along with... Bartolomeo! The latter reveals that he has eaten the Bari Bari no Mi, a very special Demon Fruit that allows him to create indestructible barriers to defend himself or... to attack, which is what he does to take down the King. Bartolomeo is thus officially the winner of the Battle Royale on Block B, to the booing of the crowd.\nNot far away, in an unassuming alleyway in Dressrosa, Soldier Lightning Fury reveals to Franky that he too intends to destroy the Smile Factory, but that he must first save the people who work there.

Luffy, still clinging to the windowsill, notices that Don Chinjao and Cavendish are no longer looking for him. He pulls himself inside and decides to check on Bellamy, who has suffered a crushing defeat. Bellamy is evacuated on a stretcher with the other defeated fighters for treatment. Bellamy compliments Luffy on the power of his Haki, before blaming himself for not being able to change and for losing again. Luffy assures him that he has indeed changed, and Bellamy \u0022thanks\u0022 him for encouraging him during his fight in B Block. During their conversation, they are spied on by Bartolomeo, who unwittingly discovers Luffy\u0027s identity and is shocked. Indeed, Bellamy has uttered his nickname \u0022Straw Hat\u0022, and Bartolomeo\u0027s face shows an expression of surprise, as he is gripped by fear...\nMeanwhile, 45 minutes from Caesar Clown\u0027s exchange with Doflamingo, Trafalgar Law, Robin, Usopp and Caesar quietly cross the bridge linking Dressrosa to Green Bit. However, they are attacked by Fighting Fish, and the small group is forced to run for their lives. Seeing that all must fight, Usopp is forced to free Caesar, who is protecting their backs after learning that Law has his heart in his possession and, knowing this, the former master of Punk Hazard could under no circumstances attempt to escape at the risk of death. As Robin and his friends set off for Green Bit, they are startled to discover that part of the bridge has collapsed. They also notice that a Fighting Fish is coming dangerously close to attack them. Leaping into the air, the animal is trapped in a giant fishing net, which appears to belong to the island\u0027s inhabitants. Law and his companions perceive voices and are surprised to hear them, believing Green Bit Island to be deserted. Finally, using Caesar\u0027s power of flight, the pirate alliance quietly flies over the bridge, well protected from the attacks of Fighting Fish. They finally arrive at Green Bit, which turns out to be a dense forest despite the presence of a sandy beach, devoid of vegetation and littered with wrecks from Fighting Fish attacks. Not a reassuring place for poor Usopp!\nBack at the Colis\u00e9e Corrida, the Battle Royale of Block C is about to begin. The fighters gather near the ring that has been repaired after the end of the Battle of Block B. Many warriors from all over the world are eagerly awaiting the start of the battle.

The young woman, overcome with remorse, tries to dissuade him, but it\u0027s too late. Entering a warehouse, Sanji easily overcomes the henchmen of the person he was supposed to kill, but the latter takes Violette hostage by pointing the barrel of his pistol at her temple. This threat doesn\u0027t distract Sanji, who, in his own way, delivers a stinging beating to the man who wanted to kill his beloved. The latter, grateful, uses her strength against her savior.

Suddenly, he spots a ship that has run aground on the island and ended up in the vegetation. Robin, for her part, notices that some of the trees have recently been cut down. According to the young archaeologist, this ship belonging to the Navy doesn\u0027t seem to have been there for very long. Law, for his part, thinks it\u0027s Smoker\u0027s ship, which was planning to call at Green Bit. Suddenly, C\u00e9sar gets angry and, thinking he\u0027s no longer safe with his captors, tells Trafalgar Law that the exchange is no longer valid. But Trafalgar Law retorts that the Navy soldiers are also his enemies, now that he\u0027s made an alliance with the Straw Hats.\nAfter leaving Caesar Clown and Trafalgar Law, Robin and Usopp begin to explore the jungle and soon discover a group of Navy soldiers who seem to be looking for the Straw Hats. Soon, a strange voice is heard in the thicket belonging to a certain Leo, who demands that they lay down their arms, but the soldiers refuse and fire warning shots to intimidate their adversary. Unimpressed, Leo steals their clothes and weapons at lightning speed. Frightened, the Marine soldiers run out of the forest after being stripped of all their belongings. Wanting to know the truth, Robin intervenes and uses her powers to find out the identity of the assailant. Using the \u0022Thousand Flowers\u0022 attack, she manages to catch the intruder and discovers that he is in fact a dwarf!\nMeanwhile, in the port city of Acacia, Zoro has managed to capture the thief who stole his sword. The thief is a dwarf called Wicca, who feels guilty at having been taken by a mere human. After confessing to having sprained her ankle in the act of capture, she asks the fencer to take her to the Flower Fields to warn her commander that the Doflamingo Family is planning to attack the Straw Hat ship. Zoro has no choice but to take him along and be guided, after Wicca discovers that the swordsman has a horrible sense of direction.\nMeanwhile, at the Coliseum Corrida, Don Chinjao is desperate for Luffy to settle his score. But his grandsons, Sai and Boo, are there to pull him together to avoid being disqualified before the start of the C Block Battle Royale, in which they and Garp\u0027s grandson are taking part.

We discover that the young woman is in fact an assassin in the pay of Trebol, an important member of Don Quixote Doflamingo\u0027s Crew. The latter had managed to trap him with her charms, but Sanji thinks it was a mistake, and that she always has a good heart. To show him that he\u0027s got her all wrong, Violette gives him a hard kick in the face, then uses her power to read his mind and find out what the Straw Hat Crew and Trafalgar Law are up to in Dressrosa and Green Bit. Unfortunately for her, she can only see his perverse thoughts, which openly shock her. But Sanji reassures her that he will never again doubt a woman\u0027s tears.

        "description": "In the isolated hangar, Sanji is at the mercy of Violette\u0027s subordinates, who have heard his confession in front of their \u0022big sister\u0022. Mocking him, they try to assassinate him, but Violette stops them using her \u0022Mekujira\u0022 attack, which nails them in place. Afterwards, she frees the cook from the Straw Hat Crew and shows him, with the power of her Demon Fruit, the plan Doflamingo had devised to trap them.\nMeanwhile, in the Colis\u00e9e Corrida, Gats, after reminding the audience of the winners of the previous two blocks, announces the start of the Battle Royale of Block C, in which Luffy takes part. The latter, in full concentration, meets a bull with steaming nostrils, while Don Chinjao and his two grandsons tremble impatiently waiting for the fight to begin. The fight begins and all the gladiators make their way to the ring to face each other. Backstage, Rebecca remembers the wise words of Soldier Lightning Fury, who had promised to always be at her side to protect her whatever happened. Thinking she had been dreaming, the young gladiator sees Franky from the window, carrying the Toy Soldier on his shoulder. Rebecca is shocked to see them. It seems there was indeed a love affair between the pretty gladiatrix and the one-legged toy soldier. Franky wonders about the affair, but is rudely interrupted by the soldier, who tells her that even toys have something to protect.\nAt the same time, in the Green Bit forest, Robin is interrogating the dwarf she has managed to catch. As Usopp joins her, they are attacked by other dwarves who send them soporific flowers. Losing consciousness, the two pirates are at the mercy of the islanders, who want to make them disappear. After a long coma, the young archaeologist wakes up to find that her entire body has been sewn to the floor! She discovers the dwarves, who take fright at the sight of her. But Leo, their leader, is the least fearful of all and confesses to Robin that it was he who had immobilized her with his power. The young woman also notices that she had been transported to the Kingdom of Tontatta, nestled in the heart of Green Bit, and that Usopp was no longer with her. Defending herself as best she could, Robin assures the dwarves that she is no threat to them. Convinced of her good faith, they release her and place their trust in her, much to the astonishment of their ruler, Gancho the Chief Tonta, who also believes in Robin\u0027s sincerity. But when she tries to steal their company in an attempt to join Law for the Caesar exchange scheduled for 3:00 pm, the dwarves become enraged. She narrowly escapes the mob\u0027s wrath thanks to another dwarf who claims she\u0027s a friend of the legendary Tontatta hero, Usopp.\nAt the same time, on the beach at Green Bit, Trafalgar Law is keeping an eye on the former master of Punk Hazard when he receives a snail phone call from Sanji warning him that he has fallen into a trap...",

        "description": "It\u0027s nearly 3pm. As Trafalgar Law watches over his prisoner on Green Bit\u0027s southeast beach, he receives a snail phone call from Sanji, warning him that he\u0027s been ambushed. The caller flees with Violette to outrun their pursuers, swords in hand, through the streets of the town. Shooting at them, the two fugitives narrowly escape death thanks to the Black Leg\u0027s skills. Having subdued his assailants, Sanji advises Law to leave immediately, explaining that there is no deal to be made with Doflamingo, as he has never left the ranks of the Shichibukai. This news comes as a surprise to the great corsair. Flashback. Thanks to Violette\u0027s gifts, Sanji knows what happened on Dressrosa before their arrival: Doflamingo didn\u0027t resign, and a navy warship bearing the CP0 logo arrived on the island. Its passengers, their faces hidden under masks, are directly under the orders of the World Nobles. The latter announced to the crowd that the news given in the morning paper was false, and that a denial would be published in the 3:00 p.m. paper.\nHaving realized that he had fallen into a trap, Law tries to flee, but Doflamingo appears, using his gifts of levitation. He quickly heads for Green Bit while Fujitora and his men approach the scene of the exchange. The Admiral, deep in escargophonic conversation with Sakazuki, is embarrassed to learn that Doflamingo\u0027s resignation was a mistake. For his part, Trafalgar Law doesn\u0027t know what to do when Robin miraculously emerges from the sand. In fact, it\u0027s a clone of the young archaeologist, created by the Hana Hana no Mi. She explains to her companions that she is inside the island with Usopp. She implores them to leave Green Bit as soon as possible, as she has also heard Sanji\u0027s call. Robin reassures her that they\u0027ll meet at the harbor, which is their next rendezvous point. But it\u0027s too late, as Fujitora and the Navy soldiers are already there! The admiral steps in front of Law and Caesar Clown when Doflamingo makes a grand entrance. The former master of Punk Hazard is very happy to see his boss again. At 3.00 p.m., Dressrosa\u0027s bells start ringing as Doflamingo and Fujitora face Law and Caesar, who discover they\u0027ve been trapped in style...\nAt the same time, at the Coliseum Corrida, the Battle Royale of Block C begins to the cheers of a packed audience. Gats introduces all the tournament\u0027s top contenders: Sai, Kerry Funk, Jean Ango, Boo, Ideo, Fighting Bull, Hajrudin, Bobby Funk, Don Chinjao and not forgetting Lucy, who is all set to take part in what promises to be an epic battle. Just as the Battle of C Block is about to begin, Cavendish emerges after learning that the Straw Hat is in the ring. But as he\u0027s one of the participants in Block D, he\u0027s arrested on the spot by the Colosseum guards watching over the entrance. Without him being able to do anything, he sees the young pirate bursting with joy when he hears the gong sound to announce the start of the fights. The fights are spectacular and delight the entire crowd. All blows are allowed, and the unlucky ones end up being devoured by the Fighting Fish that swim around the ring. Luffy uses his powers to strike down his opponents. In doing so, he unwittingly reveals his true identity. The Straw Hat must now master his moves if he is to win the tournament without getting caught! As Luffy is cheered on by the audience trying to find out who he is, Cavendish cries out for the truth, but it\u0027s no use. He\u0027s led away manu militari to the stands by Colosseum security.\nHaving noticed that \u0022Lucy\u0022 is a tough opponent, several fighters decide to attack him all at once. Le Chapeau de Paille easily dodges their attack and inflicts a severe beating. But he has a run-in with a powerful warrior armed with a hammer. But fortunately for him, Luffy quickly gets the upper hand, much to the delight of his admirers. His assailant finishes the tournament in the Fighting Fish-infested pool, while Luffy, intoxicated by the taste of victory, has to keep fighting if he doesn\u0027t want to lose.\nAt the same time, over Dressrosa, a swarm of Martins Factors flies overhead and everyone on the planet is surprised to learn that Doflamingo has not renounced his status as Grand Corsair. This news is relayed to Green Bit, where Trafalgar Law is shocked to learn that Don Quixote Doflamingo has managed to get false information published in a newspaper. The only people capable of doing this are the Celestial Dragons. He then realizes that Doflamingo was once one of them! Now that Law knows the truth, the Shichibukai calmly tells Luffy\u0027s ally that he\u0027s going to kill him...",

        "description": "At Green Bit, Trafalgar Law and Doflamingo face off. Law wonders whether the terms of the exchange should be reviewed, as Doflamingo had not respected them. Doflamingo orders him to release Caesar Clown immediately. A Navy soldier warns Issho that Punk Hazard\u0027s former master is present on the scene, and Issho replies that if he\u0027s just one of Doflamingo\u0027s subordinates, he shouldn\u0027t be captured. For his part, Doflamingo starts talking to Fujitora. Fujitora tells him how he became an admiral, and alludes to a certain Ryokugyu, undoubtedly the third admiral, pointing out that he had the same power as Doflamingo. Issho then explains that he has information on Doflamingo\u0027s actions in the underworld. He also talks to Law, and states that if he and the Straw Hat Crew have indeed formed an alliance, he will be removed from office. If, on the other hand, they are merely subordinates, nothing will happen. Law confirms that he and Luffy have formed an alliance, in order to gain time. This news angers Fujitora. He attacks him with a meteorite. The bolide heads for Green Bit beach. Caesar and the Marine soldiers immediately flee to avoid perishing, but Law remains on the spot and manages to cut the meteorite with his power. Doflamingo does the same with his Demon Fruit, while Fujitora defends himself by forming a sort of protective barrier above him with his katana. The impact of the meteorite fragments creates a huge crater where Fujitora, Doflamingo and Law had been standing. When the smoke clears, Caesar and the soldiers see three columns on each of which stand the three combatants. They face each other and challenge each other to a duel.\nMeanwhile, in Dressrosa, Franky and Sanji discuss their plan to destroy the Smile Factory via snail phone. As the Straw Hat crew\u0027s cook runs off with Violette, they see Luffy fighting in the Coliseum Corrida on a giant screen. This discovery exasperates Sanji, who gets angry at Franky for not keeping an eye on their captain and letting him do whatever he wants. For her part, Violette, seeing her pursuers coming thanks to her gift of vision, gives Sanji a map to Doflamingo\u0027s factory via the House of Toys. After Sanji asks her to meet him at the West Port, Violette flees just as Kinemon arrives unexpectedly. The samurai asks Sanji to deal with the members of the Donquichote Family who are pursuing him. After the cook defeats them, he asks him to accompany him to a place called \u0022The House of Toys\u0022 and claims that his friend Kanjuro is being held there.\nMeanwhile, at the Coliseum Corrida, Lucy\u0027s exploits are relayed by Gats\u0027 microphone to a cheering audience. The young gladiator continues to fight as if nothing had happened when he is attacked by Fighting Bull. Fighting Bull had previously confronted death row inmates and defeated them before the terrified eyes of Dressrosa\u0027s inhabitants. Now it\u0027s Lucy\u0027s turn to suffer the same fate, but the opposite happens. Using her gift of evasion, Lucy manages to further irritate the animal, which lunges at her. However, Lucy manages to stop it just in time, thanks to the power of her Haki, and even straddles it before the bewildered eyes of the Colis\u00e9e Corrida audience and Gats.\nAt the same time, in Green Bit, the tremors of the fight between Doflamingo, Law and Fujitora are felt, causing indescribable chaos in the Kingdom of Tontatta. While Usopp is eating, he and Robin discover a statue of Montblanc Norland. Leo then tells them that Norland came to Green Bit 400 years ago and defended the residents of the Dwarf Kingdom against the Great Humans who wanted to harm them. The Dwarves then ask Usopp to accompany them to Champ de Fleurs to fight against the Donquichote Family, who have oppressed them for many years...",

Nami, Brook, Chopper and Momonosuke escape with the Shark Submerge III and the young sailor\u0027s waver. Unfortunately, Jora of the Doflamingo Family has turned them into works of art with his power and taken over the Thousand Sunny. Chopper and Brook ensure that Jora\u0027s attacks are aimed at them, not their boat. However, Doflamingo\u0027s accomplice uses her abilities to turn the Sunny into a work of art. She succeeds and announces that the Crew of the Straw Hat can never leave Dressrosa again, and that their aim is to deliver Kinemon\u0027s son to his young master.\nMeanwhile, at the Coliseum Corrida, gladiator Ricky wants to leave and refuses to be treated by the doctors. Rebecca, for her part, advises him to cooperate, but he stubbornly refuses and leaves the Colosseum while Rebecca recalls her childhood memories. At the same time, in a waiting room belonging to the Doflamingo Family, Bellamy, who is being treated, explains to Diamante that Luffy is also taking part in the tournament, but under a false name. He then receives a letter from Joker ordering him to kill the Straw Hat. Diamante explains that Doflamingo is being too lenient, giving Bellamy one more chance to become part of the Doflamingo Family. But the former captain of the New Age Crew is reluctant because of the encouragement given to him by the Straw Hat during the Battle Royale of Block B, in which he took part.\nNearby, Bartolomeo makes his way to Cavendish\u0027s dressing room, telling him he\u0027d heard he was stalking Lucy. While dining, the noble pirate congratulated him on his victory, and as far as the man was concerned, it was none of his business. Bartolomeo warned him that he wouldn\u0027t let him be killed. Cavendish laughed and said that Lucy was indeed his prey.\nMeanwhile, in the ring, Coliseum Corrida\u0027s star commentator Gats explains to the massed spectators that the Battle of Block C is heating up to the point of excitement. Among the combatants is a giant by the name of Hajrudin, who atomizes all his opponents in his path, much to the delight of the Fighting Pisces swarming around the ring. His devastating punches are reminiscent of lightning and thunder, and he boasts that he will one day become king of the giants by eating the Mera Mera no Mi. But among his opponents is Fighting Bull, who had already defeated 21 death row inmates and was tamed by Lucy. This act of courage has made the young gladiator the darling of the public, further enraging Cavendish, who harbors a bitter hatred for him, much to the astonishment of Rebecca, who is at his side. Thanks to Ucy, Luffy\u0027s name for the Fighting Bull, they defeat several gladiators together, but collide head-on with Hajrudin. Enraged, the giant attacks them and crushes them like pancakes. Ucy is knocked out and Luffy is crushed, but the latter quickly gets up to see the state of his friend. Seeing him in such a bad way, the young pirate becomes furious. Filled with rage, he leaps into the air and delivers a Haki-enhanced Jet Pistol to Hajrudin, who collapses heavily onto the other opponents...",

The crowd, surprised by this unexpected event, begins to applaud the valiant victor. Meanwhile, Luffy helps Ucy to his feet after the Fighting Bull\u0027s attack, then leads him out of the ring. In the VIP box, Cavendish, who is enjoying a meal, is unimpressed by Luffy\u0027s power, while Bartolomeo, who is standing next to him, enjoyed the fight. Rebecca, for her part, is shocked by Luffy\u0027s show of strength in taking down the giant.\nIn the ring, Ideo walks up to Hajrudin and tells him that the ring is no place to take a nap. He throws an explosive punch that literally sends Hajrudin to the stands. Gats is surprised by Ideo\u0027s explosive blows, which is why this astonishing fighter is nicknamed the \u0022Destroyer Cannon\u0022.\nAt the same time, in the capital of Dressrosa, Zoro continues to run in the direction of the Field of Flowers in the company of Wicca, who guides him, not without giving him a lecture, so as not to get lost in the city\u0027s alleyways. Weary of his complaints, the swordsman abandons him and continues on his way alone. Distraught, Wicca remains alone and weeps, lamenting the future fate of her companions. But Zoro retraces his steps and, still lost, takes the young dwarf who this time guides him correctly to the Field of Flowers.\nNot far away, on Green Bit, the confrontation between Doflamingo, Fujitora and Law becomes inevitable. Still perched on his column, the Navy Admiral kicks off the festivities, using his power to send a new meteorite ready to split at his enemies. But Trafalgar Law neutralizes his attack using his gifts. Using his saber, he cuts the bolide in half and it sinks into the waves around the island. Now it\u0027s Doflamingo\u0027s turn to attack his rival. Law dodges the Shichibukai\u0027s attacks as best he can, and manages to leave the crater where he was with Fujitora and Doflamingo. Rushing headlong into the island\u0027s jungle, he tries to lose his pursuer. Issho, for his part, gives chase to the two pirates with the help of his men. Trafalgar Law\u0027s situation becomes worrying, as Doflamingo is still hot on his heels. Soon, however, he is no match for his attackers and finds himself surrounded by his hereditary enemy on the one hand, and by naval soldiers led by Fujitora on the other.\nBack to the Colis\u00e9e Corrida. Gats announces to a cheering crowd the forthcoming fight between Ideo and Lucy. While fighting him, Ideo declares that he wishes to seize the Pyro-Fruit to become the strongest. But Lucy disagrees with him and makes him understand by bravely facing his blows. Gats is stunned by the spectacle. He suddenly turns his attention to the three fighters from the Land of Ka, Sai, Boo and Don Chinjao, who continue to strike down their opponents with disconcerting ease. Alone, Jean Ango remains standing in the ring and takes advantage of the situation to steal the weapons of the defeated gladiators. He is soon joined by the Funk Brothers, who are still in contention to win the tournament. But Kerry Funk has a run-in with Boo, who gives him a severe beating. \u0022Threaded onto the giant body of his younger brother, Bobby Funk, who has eaten the Jake Jake no Mi, Kerry manages to get his revenge, knocking out Boo, one of the three fighters from the Land of Ka.\nDuring his fight against Ideo, Luffy loses his helmet and, fearing recognition, tries to get it back after draping his famous Straw Hat with his cape. But bounty hunter Jean Ango has the precious item in his possession. Angered, Lucy learns from him that he is a wanted man. Meanwhile, Don Chinjao continues to wreak havoc in the ring, desperate to eliminate Garp\u0027s grandson, his greatest enemy, once and for all. Just as they are about to face off, Garts announces to all present that there are only forty fighters left to compete for victory in the Battle Royale of Block C...",

        "description": "The Bloc C match has reached its final phase. Kerry Funk demolishes his competitors with fury. For his part, Chinjao sends Xai to fight him, to make them pay for the audacity of having defeated Boo, while he pursues Luffy, for whom he has a score to settle. Luffy tries to catch up with Jean Ango, who had stolen his helmet, but the Straw Hat realizes too late that Don Chinjao is on his trail, shouting his grandfather\u0027s name. But in the course of the battle, Lucy loses her fake beard, which threatens to reveal her true identity. Fighting with all his might to remain anonymous, he dodges the dozens of daggers thrown at him by Jean Ango to stop him.\nMeanwhile, in the ring, a surviving gladiator saw what had happened to the Funk Brothers. He discovered that Kerry Funk had eaten the Jake Jake no Mi that allows him to take over his brother\u0027s body and use it as a second skin, sweeping away his personality and using his cruelty and fighting spirit with Bobby\u0027s robust body. Armed with this power, the Funk Brothers easily beat Boo, much to the chagrin of Xai, who can\u0027t stifle his anger. Nevertheless, he managed to avenge his comrade\u0027s defeat by beating Kerry with a single heel strike using the strength of Hasshoken. At the top of the rostrum, Gats is ecstatic, admiring Xai\u0027s prowess in the art of combat.\nWhile Lucy desperately searches for Jean Ango to retrieve her helmet, Ideo appears and challenges Xai, who has just beaten the Funk Brothers, to a duel. The fight promises to be an arduous one, as both fighters are determined to seize the Mera Mera no Mi. Not far away, near Dressrosa, Nami and Momonosuke try to lose Jora\u0027s men using his waver. They are soon joined by Brook and Chopper, who create a diversion using Sunny\u0027s pocket submarine. Using the power of her weather wand, Nami manages to generate a storm that pulverizes the Doflamingo Family\u0027s submarine, much to Jora\u0027s dismay as he broods over his revenge.\nAt the same time, at the Coliseum Corrida, Luffy has to face Jean Ango, who has become a huge mass of weapons and swords ready to fall on him. While hurling projectiles at Luffy, the bounty hunter tells him that he\u0027s gone in search of all the escapees who escaped from Impel Down with the Straw Hat, including Baggy, Jinbe, Crocodile, Emporio Ivankov and Shiliew. He doesn\u0027t have time to finish his sentence when he spots Don Chinjao behind Luffy. Chinjao gets rid of him with a violent headbutt that ejects Jean Ango from the ring after Luffy has had time to retrieve his precious helmet.\nNot far away, at the other end of the ring, Xai and Ideo duel, showing everyone that they\u0027re just as strong as each other. Eager to start their own duel and settle the score, Luffy and Chinjao brutally interrupt the two gladiators\u0027 fight by ejecting each other from the ring, provoking the excitement of the audience, Cavendish, Bartolomeo and Rebecca, who realize that there are only two fighters left in the C Block Battle Royale, each with the ability to use the Haki of Kings: Lucy (aka Luffy) and Don Chinjao...",

        "description": "A fierce battle ensues between Luffy and Don Chinjao. The latter learns that Rayleigh had taught the young pirate to use the Haki of Kings. Suddenly, the 12th commander of the Happou Fleet begins to weep as he recalls the memory of a lost treasure, before furiously attacking Luffy for being the grandson of Garp, his sworn enemy. At the same time, Sanji and Kinemon, in disguise, are in the streets of the city, watching the battle on the big screen. They soon discover Navy soldiers, led by Vice-Admiral Bastille, eagerly awaiting the exit of the defeated from the Colis\u00e9e Corrida. But time is of the essence, as Sanji and Kinemon must get to the House of Toys immediately to rescue Kanjuro, who is being held prisoner there. Meanwhile, Soldier Lightning Fury explains to Franky that there are two laws instituted by Doflamingo when he ascended to the throne of Dressrosa ten years ago. The first is a curfew that forces humans and toys to return to their homes at precisely midnight. The second is that humans must not enter toys\u0027 homes, and vice versa. The tragedy, however, is that not everyone in Dressrosa knows that the toys were once flesh-and-blood beings transformed into toys by a strange curse. Soldier Lightning Fury reveals to Franky that a mysterious Demon Fruit user has been brought to Dressrosa on Doflamingo\u0027s orders and has metamorphosed some of the island\u0027s inhabitants, while causing the other to lose his memory. This news comes as a surprise to the carpenter of the Straw Hat Crew, who realizes that his new companion was once a human being! However, the Lightning Fury Soldier won\u0027t confide in him until they\u0027re both in the Field of Flowers.\nMeanwhile, at the Coliseum Corrida, Luffy\u0027s battle with Don Chinjao continues apace. The two fighters are of equal strength, and the confrontation promises to be long and bloody. Under the admiring gazes of his two grandsons, Sai and Boo, Chinjao tries to crush Luffy, who is much faster than he is. The former commander of the Happou Fleet confesses that he\u0027s going to avenge all the evil Garp did to him when, 30 years ago, he seized not only his fortune and treasure, but also his strength, which resided in his head, which is as hard as steel. Using an unstoppable fighting technique, Don Chinjao transforms himself into a giant top that sweeps away everything in its path. Luffy tries to thwart his plan, but to no avail. Don Chinjao is more determined than ever to avenge the outrage Garp has inflicted on him.\nNot far away, on Green Bit, Doflamingo continues to track Trafalgar Law through the island\u0027s jungle. The pirate tries to lose his pursuer, but the latter is tough. For his part, Issho throws rocks at him. Eventually, he throws another meteorite at him, which falls heavily on the island, causing a huge explosion. Law barely escapes with his life. While trying to save his life, Law tries to contact Nami, whom he believes to have stayed behind on the Sunny, by snail phone, but receives no reply. Meanwhile, on Green Bit, the dwarves are in a panic. Imploring the help of their new hero, Usoland, he explains that it is the power of his Haki that is causing the ground to shake. Leo reveals to Robin and Usopp that he wishes to rescue Princess Mansherry and 500 of her dwarf friends, who are being held prisoner in the Smile Factory beneath the Colosseum...",

The two members of the Straw Hat Crew use express foxes to travel through an underground passage linking Green Bit to Dressrosa, bypassing the dangerous iron bridge. Meanwhile, Soldier Lightning Fury and Franky enter the headquarters of \u0022King Riku\u0027s Army\u0022, located beneath the Field of Flowers, and meet the anti-Doflamingo coalition cheering their leader, none other than the Toy Soldier! It\u0027s in this secret lair that Franky meets up with Zoro, who is absorbed in Luffy\u0027s showdown with Don Chinjao. Despite Wicca\u0027s pleas for him to get back to his ship immediately, the swordsman is mesmerized by the fight taking place at the Coliseum Corrida, which is being broadcast on every screen on the island. Suddenly, Zoro realizes the danger facing the Sunny and decides to make his way to his ship before it\u0027s too late.\nAt the same time, in the Colis\u00e9e Corrida ring, the fight between Luffy and Chinjao reaches its climax.

Kinemon is equally enthusiastic, which seriously annoys Sanji, who reminds him that they both have to get to the House of Toys to free Kanjuro.

While Jora continues to rage against the young sailor, Chopper receives an escrogophonic call from Law, who asks him to take the Sunny to Green Bit and leave Caesar, who will always serve as a bargaining chip.

By the end of the fight, Luffy and Don Chinjao are exhausted. The Straw Hat compliments his opponent on his strength, which exasperates him. Not understanding what was happening to him, Chinjao began to tell him how Garp had stolen his \u0022strength\u0022. Thirty years ago, Chinjao\u0027s gang lived on a winter island continually covered in ice, and beneath this ice lay a fabulous treasure. The ice could only be broken with powerful head blows. One day, Chinjao got into a fight with Garp, Luffy\u0027s grandfather, who delivered a violent punch that deformed the skull of the future leader of the Ka Country Gang. This serious injury prevented him from ever tapping the ice to break it, thus rendering the fabulous treasure inaccessible. Since that fateful day, Chinjao has vowed eternal hatred for Garp and all his descendants.\nDon Chinjao insults Luffy, telling him that Rayleigh had wasted his time trying to train him, and congratulates the Navy soldiers for executing Ace in Marineford. These hurtful words are enough to inflame the Straw Hat\u0027s blood, and he starts attacking him, with Chinjao following suit.\nLuffy prepares a Thor Elephant Gun to attack him, while Don Chinjao uses a headbutt to thwart his plan. The Straw Hat\u0027s assault is so swift that it hits his opponent\u0027s head full force. The effect of this attack is to return Chinjao\u0027s head to the way it was before Garp distorted it thirty years ago. By defeating Don Chinjao before the helpless eyes of his two grandsons, Boo and Xai, Luffy automatically wins Block C.

Fleeing Chinjao\u0027s warm-hearted outbursts and Cavendish\u0027s hatred of him, Luffy manages to lose them and reunites with Rebecca when they both come across Jesus Burgess. The latter is chatting quietly with Blackbeard on a snail phone. The Straw Hat and Riku\u0027s granddaughter learn that Burgess and Teach are planning to recruit Aokiji into their crew! Luffy, in his rage against Blackbeard, says no one will touch Ace\u0027s power, although Marshall D. Teach says Burgess will win the tournament because he\u0027s the strongest.\nTo calm her nerves, Rebecca takes the Straw Hat to a quieter spot where gladiators usually go to rest and offers Lucy a hearty bent\u014d. The young gladiator is impressed by the strength her friend has shown in winning the Battle Royale of Block C. Suddenly Rebecca changes face and sets a trap for Lucy, who is unwillingly immobilized by an imprisoned gladiator. While continuing to eat, the Straw Hat manages to foil her plan, but he doesn\u0027t hold it against her. Indeed, Luffy\u0027s motto is never to take revenge on someone who has offered him something to eat. Impressed by Luffy\u0027s prowess, the imprisoned gladiators explain to him that Coliseum battles were not originally lethal, while Rebecca reveals her plan to Luffy: win the Coliseum Corrida tournament in order to win the Mera Mera no Mi, which will be used to eliminate Doflamingo and his tyranny once and for all...",

This one-legged tin soldier was once her guardian when the young woman\u0027s mother died. He raised her throughout her childhood. But an announcement from Gats immediately brings the young woman back to reality, informing the participants of the D Block Battle Royale that the ring was operational again. Rebecca sets off to fight, leaving Luffy with the imprisoned gladiators.\nAs she makes her way to the ring, where other D Block fighters are already present, Rebecca remembers her past as a little girl. As a little girl, she helped her mother Scarlett sell flowers to support herself. When they learn that the soldiers of the Riku kingdom have plundered their own country, they decide to flee, and are helped by Soldier Lightning Fury. Unfortunately, Scarlett loses her life while trying to find food for Rebecca. This death causes great grief to Soldier Lightning Fury, who vows to protect the daughter of the woman he failed to save, no matter what. Just then, Doflamingo arrives to seize the throne, making Riku, the former sovereign, the most hated man in Dressrosa. Over the years, the tin soldier has done his best to protect Rebecca, so much so that a bounty for his capture was placed on his head after he freed the little girl from the clutches of two slave traders who wanted to sell her. Behaving like a father to her, Soldier Lightning Fury taught Rebecca how to fight to protect herself.\nBack to the present: Rebecca is in the Colosseum corridor, facing the ring. She thinks back to the words she\u0027d spoken to Soldier Lightning Fury, when she told him \u0022You\u0027ll always be by my side...\u0022 \u0022You\u0027ll always protect me...\u0022. Gats, the tournament commentator, introduces the gladiatrix as the \u0022beautiful swordswoman of the Colosseum\u0022 and even refers to her as the \u0022Phantom Princess\u0022. Rebecca advances, asking the Toy Soldier not to die. Before fighting, she promises not to lose in front of an audience enraged by the sight of the young gladiatrix. Much to Luffy\u0027s surprise, she is booed off the stage by both the gladiators and the audience. Rebecca cries and the Straw Hat discovers how much Rebecca is hated by the Colosseum crowd. He also realizes how much Rebecca\u0027s grandfather, the former King Riku, was hated by everyone in this country...",

The young gladiator thanks him, but \u0022the Magnificent Pirate Captain\u0022 reminds her that they are both enemies. Gats kicks off the Battle Royale of Block D, which begins after ringing the gong with 137 competitors ready to fight to the death in the Colosseum arena.\nMeanwhile, on Green Bit, Doflamingo continues to chase Trafalgar Law through the island\u0027s jungle, decimating every tree in his path. Law, exhausted, faces his adversary. He immediately guessed who he was up against: a former Celestial Dragon! Doflamingo doesn\u0027t seem surprised by his discovery and continues to attack him using his powers. He finally captures him by tying him firmly to the trunk of a tree. Doflamingo orders him to give him Caesar Clown\u0027s heart, but the latter refuses after realizing that Punk Hazard\u0027s former master was the only one capable of providing him with Smiles. Without these precious Demon Fruits, Kaidou, one of the Four Emperors, would attack Doflamingo and kill him on the spot. Using the powers of Ope Ope no Mi, Law manages to outwit Doflamingo. But Doflamingo quickly catches up with him before fighting him. Just as he is about to deliver the final blow, he is rudely interrupted by Fujitora, who orders him to spare him. Indeed, the Navy Admiral wishes to arrest this Pirate Captain rather than see him dead. Doflamingo submits to Fujitora, but not before taking back Caesar\u0027s heart from Law.\nNot far away, Leo and his airborne troops from the Kingdom of Tontatta, accompanied by Robin and Usopp, arrive at the secret base of the Field of Flowers. There, Leo and Private Lightning Fury deliver their speech to their men, preparing them for the battle ahead. Meanwhile in Dressrosa, Zoro, with Wicca\u0027s help, tries to find his way back to Nami and the others aboard the Thousand Sunny, but is noticed by Kinemon and Sanji, who call out to him in the distance. The swordsman tells them of the danger facing the Sunny\u0027s crew when Violette appears around the corner. The young woman informs them that their ship has already been captured by Jora and is now on its way to Green Bit.\nAt the same time, Gats announces to the crowd at the Colis\u00e9e Corrida that the Battle Royale for Block D has begun. Rebecca becomes the target of five fierce gladiators, whom she quickly disposes of using her great fencing skills. All the while keeping in mind her desire to win the tournament and seize the Mera Mera no Mi to annihilate Doflamingo once and for all, and remembering the advice given to her by Soldier Lightning Fury in her youth. She triumphed over her five opponents. The young gladiatrix doesn\u0027t stop there, and is more motivated than ever to fight to the bitter end...",

He then reveals to his defeated opponent that the royal family that ruled Dressrosa before the Riku family was none other than the Don Quixote family. Law now realizes that he\u0027s up against a Celestial Dragon!\nMeanwhile, aboard the deformed Thousand Sunny, Brook nonchalantly advises Jora to make abstract art, while she turns Nami, Chopper and Momonosuke into works of art and threatens them with death. However, Jora is tricked by the living skeleton after restoring Brook\u0027s cane and violin to their original forms. Once their enemy is defeated, her spell is broken and everyone, including the ship, returns to their normal appearance.\nOn Dressrosa, in front of the locked gates of the Coliseum Corrida, Zoro, Wicca and Kinemon try to enter to find Luffy, while Sanji decides to rescue Nami and the others aboard the Sunny with Violette\u0027s help. As they wonder how they\u0027ll get into the circus, Bartolomeo notices them. Bartolomeo remembers Zoro\u0027s exploits and can\u0027t help but burst into tears at the sight of him. At the same time, Luffy enthusiastically follows Rebecca\u0027s progress in the D Block Battle Royale, cheering her on loudly.\nHeading for Green Bit, Nami, Chopper and Momonosuke are overjoyed to have regained their original appearance and thank Brook for delivering them from Jora\u0027s power. Just as they\u0027re about to handcuff her in Sea Granite to annihilate the powers of her Demon Fruit, Doflamingo\u0027s subordinate stands up. She is very angry with Brook for betraying her and, in revenge, transforms herself into a gigantic monster ready to annihilate them.\nMeanwhile, at the Royal Palace in Dressrosa, Baby 5 discusses Violette\u0027s betrayal with Gladius, one of Pica\u0027s subordinates, who is clearly not very happy with the traitor because she didn\u0027t follow the plan. Indeed, northeast of Dressrosa, Sanji and Violette are riding a toy horse towards Green Bit, which is just around the corner. Violette advises Sanji that he and his friends should change their rendezvous point, since the port of Acacia has welcomed four ships and over 3,000 navy troops. The cook of the Chapeau de Paille crew is impressed by the young woman\u0027s power to know in advance everything that will happen within a radius of 4,000 kilometers. Unfortunately, she can\u0027t see where the Sunny is at the moment. Indeed, the Straw Hat ship is battling with Jora, who wants to make them pay. Nami tries to counterattack using her Climat Tact, but to no avail. However, she is saved in extremis by Brook, who tries to confront Doflamingo\u0027s subordinate head-on. The latter doesn\u0027t give in and tries to immobilize her attacker. Nami takes the opportunity to activate the Groar Canon with Chopper\u0027s help. The effect is immediate, pulverizing Jora\u0027s work of art in the blink of an eye. But Jora has not said her last word. But it\u0027s not to her liking, as she is knocked unconscious by Momonosuke and struck down by Nami. Defeated, Jora is now the prisoner of the Straw Hats, much to the delight of Kinemon\u0027s son...",

Nami doesn\u0027t know what to do with her, except to tie her up with sea-granite chains to keep her out of further trouble. Remembering Law\u0027s words, the Straw Hats decide to set sail for Green Bit to retrieve Caesar Clown, who was due to be handed over to Doflamingo. Jora informs them that his master has never abdicated the rank of Shichibukai. This news terrifies Chopper and his friends, especially when they learn that the rest of the Straw Hat Crew is probably in the hands of the Donquichotte Family.\nMeanwhile, at the Colis\u00e9e Corrida, the Battle Royale of Block D continues to rage. Gats, at the peak of his powers, introduces the audience to the personalities who have come to compete. First there\u0027s a notorious war criminal by the name of Suleyman the Beheader. Then comes the \u0022Overseer\u0022 Orombus, adventurer and admiral of the great Yonte Maria Fleet. Then there\u0027s Rolling Logan, captain of the army of the Kingdom of Majiatsuka, Agyou, a fighting lion, Damask, the pyromaniac, Mummy the Sorcerer, Acilia, a fearsome gladiator, not forgetting Cavendish on the White Horse, the tournament favorite. First, Cavendish must face Gardoa, the magnificent bounty hunter. To silence this young white boy, Cavendish uses his sword Durandal to defeat him, and succeeds with disconcerting ease. Cheered on by the audience, Cavendish boasts, making Rebecca forget all about him as she continues to fight for her life. Luffy follows her attentively on the screen installed in the dungeon of the imprisoned gladiators. The young woman dodges all her opponents\u0027 attacks with the utmost agility, while other tournament participants try to beat her.\nNot far away, on Green Bit, Trafalgar Law is still the prisoner of Fujitora and Doflamingo. He\u0027s still reeling from the news that his worst enemy is a Celestial Dragon! Just as the latter was about to try something against Luffy\u0027s companions left behind in Dressrosa, Caesar Clown, still handcuffed, appears and asks his young master to return the heart Law had taken from him. But this was in fact a decoy, as the heart Doflamingo has in his possession is in fact that of a naval soldier, who is writhing in pain after the King of Dressrosa begins triturating the stolen organ. Fujitora doesn\u0027t like this treatment and makes him understand. Taking advantage of a moment\u0027s inattention on the part of his jailers, Law uses the powers of his Demon Fruit to escape Fujitora\u0027s \u0022gravity\u0022 and succeeds in recapturing Caesar Clown.\nThe Shichibukai manages to dodge all of Doflamingo\u0027s attacks through the jungle, while Sunny comes within sight of the island. Chopper scans the shoreline with binoculars, looking for Trafalgar Law. Suddenly, a school of Fighting Fish emerges from the water and attacks Luffy\u0027s ship. As Nami, Brook, Chopper and Momonosuke face this new ordeal, Law tries to lose his pursuer while taking Caesar with him. He then hatches a plan which, if all goes well, could well succeed: to reach the bridge linking Green Bit and Dressrosa, so as to put his prisoner on the boat while he stays there to face his adversary more easily. The ultimate aim of this plan is to enable Sunny to quickly get away from the shores of Green Bit. Suddenly, Doflamingo stopped pursuing Law when he spotted the Straw Hat ship battling with the Fighting Fish. Soaring into the air, the ruler of Dressrosa begins his attack, with Law powerless to stop him. Helplessly, Law sees Doflamingo fly off to destroy his precious allies, when suddenly Sanji appears and, with a leap, manages to deflect his adversary\u0027s attack before engaging in a perilous battle with him...",

Panic-stricken, the soldiers call for help from their commander, who orders them to leave immediately for Dressrosa.\nMeanwhile, the crew of the Chapeau de Paille are still trying to escape Doflamingo\u0027s relentless attacks. Trafalgar Law reveals that Doflamingo can\u0027t catch up with them in cloudless areas with his power, and advises them to quickly find a way to outrun their pursuer. Sanji understands better what\u0027s going on when he learns that Doflamingo has mastered the wires, and Law jumps ship at this point, capturing Jora and joining Joker on the bridge linking Green Bit to Dressrosa. The Straw Hats then flee with a violent \u0022Burst Blast\u0022.\nAt the same time, on the outskirts of the Coliseum Corrida, Zoro, in the company of Kinemon, calls out to Bartolomeo, who can\u0027t help crying at the sight of his idol. He asks him if there\u0027s another way into the building, as all the doors are closed. Hearing Luffy and Zoro\u0027s names, Kinemon is amazed that their interlocutor knows their true identities.\nMeanwhile, in the Colosseum arena, the Battle Royale of Block D continues to rage. All the participants are fighting like lions to emerge victorious from this tournament. Cavendish eliminates his opponents one by one, as does Rebecca, who fights valiantly under the astonished eyes of Gats. The young gladiatrix\u0027s fighting technique also attracts Cavendish\u0027s attention, and he can\u0027t understand why she doesn\u0027t attack. All she does is dodge her attackers. But the Horseman on the White Horse is having a hard time with Acilia, who is determined to get rid of him. Suddenly, three imposing warriors force Rebecca back to the edge of the fighting fish-infested pool. To the booing of the public, her three adversaries launch themselves at her, but Rebecca, with disconcerting ease, manages to deflect their blows and throw them into the pool before the stunned eyes of Cavendish and Luffy, who hasn\u0027t lost a step in the fight!\nFar away, several miles from Dressrosa, the Sunny sails as quickly as possible to outrun Doflamingo in cloud-free zones. Sanji takes advantage of this respite to communicate with Usopp by snail phone and explain the change of plan decided by Trafalgar Law. His friend is anxious to leave the island, as the climate is unhealthy. However, Franky, who is standing next to him, swears to destroy the Smile Factory come what may, while Sanji informs them that Zoro and Kinemon have gone to tell Luffy what\u0027s going on. He also explains that Law has left the ship with Jora to confront Doflamingo on the bridge linking Green Bit to Dressrosa. Doflamingo doesn\u0027t understand Law\u0027s motives, as he\u0027s letting half the Straw Hats go while he stays behind as if to sacrifice himself. Doflamingo reminds the Shichibukai that the other half of Luffy\u0027s crew are still in Dressrosa and that he could very well take them hostage in order to get Caesar back. Law then tells him that a lot of people have bitten their fingers off by underestimating them, and immediately puts an end to the alliance he had created with Luffy a few days earlier. Indeed, Law explains that he had been using the Straw Hat Pirates from the start with the sole aim of destroying Doflamingo\u0027s Smiles production. He also confesses that even if he doesn\u0027t succeed in killing him, the mere fact of destroying his Smiles production will provoke Kaidou\u0027s wrath, and he will personally want Doflamingo dead. He concludes by announcing that he would have loved to see the chaos that Joker\u0027s death would bring to the whole world, but all he cares about now is making him pay for all the misdeeds he committed thirteen years ago...",

Law asserts that the reason he wants to take revenge on Doflamingo is not personal, but to avenge someone he once loved. Following this revelation, the fight between Doflamingo and Law begins with a bang.\nAt the same time, off Dressrosa, the Thousand Sunny leaves these inhospitable shores to sail towards Zou. All aboard are happy to have escaped Doflamingo, even if they\u0027re a little uneasy about leaving their friends on the island. Sanji informs his comrades that Robin is safe with Franky and Usopp before comforting Momonosuke, who had turned back into a dragon. The Straw Hat Crew\u0027s cook discovers that Kinemon\u0027s son had already seen Doflamingo at work when he was in Dressrosa with his father and Kanjuro, who is still being held prisoner on the island. As Momonosuke laments his friend\u0027s fate, Sanji thinks back fondly to the last moments he spent with Violette before leaving to rescue his friends. He remembers her words. She had asked him not to worry about her, as she was under the protection of the World Government.\nOn Dressrosa, Violette gallops at full speed towards the Royal Palace of Dressrosa. Along the way, she spots a giant screen broadcasting Rebecca\u0027s fight in the Colis\u00e9e Corrida. Seeing the hatred the spectators have for the young gladiatrix, the beautiful flamenco dancer destroys the giant screen with a pistol shot before continuing on her way.\nAt the same time, in the Coliseum Corrida, Bartolomeo, who knows that Luffy is taking part in the tournament under the name of Lucy, promises Zoro to help him find the Straw Hat in exchange for an autograph. Meanwhile, the D Block Battle Royale is in full swing. Fierce competitors clash fiercely and the others are eliminated one by one! While Cavendish takes down yet another gladiator with a vengeance, Rolling Logan, military commander of the Southern Kingdom of Majiatsuka, enters the fray. He easily overcomes his opponent using his astonishing fighting techniques, while Gats looks on in amazement. His attention is suddenly drawn to Rebecca, who is under renewed attack. But the young gladiatrix demonstrates her agility and her ability to use Observation Haki, knocking out a number of opponents in the process. Suddenly, Rolling Logan notices Rebecca\u0027s presence and advances to attack her. Luffy, in disguise, anxiously follows what happens next...",

        "description": "Bartolomeo, still on cloud nine from meeting his idol Zoro, searches every corner of the Colis\u00e9e Corrida for Luffy. He thinks the other members of the Straw Hat Crew are also in Dressrosa, and hopes to meet them in the flesh. Suddenly, his attention is drawn to a strange staircase that leads him into the dark basement of the huge arena. He soon hears noises and discovers that the fighters, who had lost their bouts, were being brought there for treatment. The Colosseum staff ask him to leave, so as not to incur the wrath of the defeated fighters. Understandably, he leaves just as Xai, who is looking for his grandfather, is summoned by the nurses to be treated. But instead, he falls into a trap and is sent to the Colosseum\u0027s foundations, which resemble a huge prison, where he finds his relative and the other gladiators who have lost their battle.\nMeanwhile, in the Colosseum Corrida arena, the Battle Royale of Block D continues apace. All participants fight like lions in front of an audience happy to admire such warriors. Gats is excited to announce that Rolling Logan has decided to fight Rebecca, who has been undefeated since the start of the tournament. Provoking the crowd to ensure that his future victim is defeated quickly, Rolling Logan receives an immeasurable popularity which irritates Luffy, who can\u0027t understand why everyone in Dressrosa hates Rebecca so much. The Straw Hat thinks the young woman is a good person. The prisoners he\u0027s with also agree, and one of them even tries to explain to him why Rebecca is so unpopular. But Luffy is too engrossed in the beautiful gladiatrix\u0027s battle to hear her story.\nIn the Coliseum Corrida ring, Rolling Logan starts attacking Rebecca, who dodges his blows as best she can. She then tries to flee, but is quickly caught by her opponent, who has the knack of anticipating her every move in order to trap her. Trapped, the young gladiatrix has no escape but to jump into the fighting fish-infested pool. But she doesn\u0027t. Suddenly, Rolling Logan\u0027s attention is drawn to another fighter who had taken advantage of the situation to attack him from behind. He grabs him and crushes him in his powerful hand as if he were a common insect. Witnessing the scene, Rebecca fled to avoid being her opponent\u0027s next victim, immediately provoking the public\u0027s displeasure as they discovered the young gladiatrix\u0027s cowardice. Rolling Logan chases after her, knocking down other opponents in her path. Suddenly, Rebecca is stopped in her tracks by a fighter who has just been defeated, and loses her precious sword. Her pursuer takes advantage of her disadvantage to grab her. Rebecca struggles as hard as she can, but is eventually caught and passes out. Drunk with power, Rolling Logan takes the young gladiatrix between his fingers. The entire Coliseum Corrida audience witnesses Rebecca\u0027s defeat, and exults in joy under the admiring gaze of Gats, who is commentating on the tournament.\nRebecca is now at Rolling Logan\u0027s mercy. She regains consciousness and realizes she can no longer escape him. He begins to clamp his fingers on her, crushing her bones. Rebecca lets out a huge cry of pain that excites her adversary. The situation displeases Luffy and his fellow prisoners. As Rebecca succumbs to Rolling Logan\u0027s onslaught, she remembers her training with Soldier Lightning Fury. Just as she was about to die, Acilia intervenes to attack Rolling Logan, who drops his victim to the ground. The latter gets up and witnesses the titanic battle between her former adversary and the warrior who had saved her life. Picking up her sword, the young gladiatrix thanks her for her gesture. Acilia graces their new friendship with a broad smile before attacking Rolling Logan. The latter, very upset by the warrior\u0027s attitude, easily overcomes her. Seeing her new friend in a bad way, Rebecca decides to help her and attacks Rolling Logan for the first time, who loses his balance under the weight of this assault and ends up in the Fighting Fish-infested pool before the stunned eyes of the crowd and Gats, who can\u0027t believe this turn of events. To the booing of the Colosseum spectators, Acilia congratulates Rebecca on her success in defeating their opponent and advises her to go all the way to the final to win the prize. To achieve this, she even helps her beat the other tournament participants who had ganged up against her. Rebecca continues to fight like a lioness under the admiring eyes of Luffy and the prisoner warriors, who are delighted that their champion is still in the tournament. Wanting to get a closer look at the fight, Luffy abandons his companions to return to the surface and, on the way, meets Bartolomeo who immediately recognizes him, despite his disguise...",

Bartolomeo is overjoyed to finally meet his idol, but the Straw Hat couldn\u0027t care less and continues on his way. However, he is stopped by the winner of Block B and has to talk to him to find out what he wants.\nMeanwhile, many defeated gladiators land in the basement of the Coliseum Corrida. Among them are Boo, Ideo and the Funk Brothers, who are thrown into a pit filled with toys in the company of other unlucky warriors. Former king Riku is astonished to find an old underground dump beneath the Colosseum. Meanwhile, Tank Lepanto, one of the commanders of Dressrosa\u0027s former royal army, believes he recognizes former King Riku Dold III among the gladiators. All the gladiators are astonished when they hear this news. Indeed, Riku was the former ruler of Dressrosa before he was dethroned by Doflamingo, but he was also Rebecca\u0027s grandfather, who is still competing in the D Block Battle Royale.\nAt the same time, the king of the kingdom of Prodense, Elizabello II, who was defeated by Bartolomeo during the Block B tournament, is happy to be reunited with King Riku, who had saved Prodense several times in the past. With this support, hope is reborn in the former king\u0027s heart. Suddenly, the toys in the dump begin to rise and bow to the former ruler of Dressrosa. It is then discovered that they were all part of the former royal army. In the shadows, Hack, also defeated, communicates by snail phone with a mysterious stranger outside the Colosseum, confirming his suspicions about this strange basement.\nSuddenly, without warning, a mysterious slimy mass seizes Xai and carries him away. Boo and Don Chinjao rush to his rescue. Despite their combined efforts, their comrade is sucked into a hole. When he regains consciousness, Xai finds himself stretched out on a bed and bound by the slimy mass. He soon sees Trebol appear before him, immediately turning him into a toy. After ordering him not to harm humans and to follow the Donquichotte Family\u0027s orders without flinching, he commands him to go to the Smile Factory and the Trading Port to work.\nNot far away, on the Field of Flowers, the headquarters of King Riku\u0027s army, Gancho explains to Usopp, Robin and Franky that the Dwarves once took to the sea in search of resources their country could not produce. One day, a certain Donquichotte proposed a treaty with the Dwarves so that the men would stop attacking them. The Dwarves accepted, and a new era of slavery began. This dark era ended when King Riku came to power 800 years ago, at the end of the Lost Century. The dwarves and the Riku family forged a lasting relationship during this period. However, Gancho confesses that 10 years ago, when Doflamingo regained power, he tried to institute the same diabolical policies as his ancestors and had 500 Dwarves, including Gancho\u0027s granddaughter Princess Mansherry, locked up in his prison gaols. Suddenly, the attention of the three members of the Straw Hat Crew is drawn to a television monitor broadcasting the Battle Royale of Block D. They see Rebecca fighting with numerous gladiators. Robin takes advantage of the situation to ask the Lightning-Fury Soldier with them if the gladiator fighting in the Colosseum is really King Riku\u0027s granddaughter. The Toy Soldier replies that she is, before telling her about his past and revealing that he is Rebecca\u0027s real father...",

Ten years ago, Doflamingo appeared at the king\u0027s home to reclaim his throne and country. If Riku didn\u0027t obey him, Dressrosa would suffer serious consequences. To avoid this, Doflamingo asked Riku for 10 billion Berrys to sell him Dressrosa. Not wanting to see his people perish at the hands of the Shichibukai, Riku sent his soldiers to collect the money from the citizens to save his country. They willingly deposited everything they owned, because they trusted their sovereign. But suddenly, everything changed. Doflamingo used the power of Ito Ito no Mi and controlled King Riku and his subordinates to attack and massacre the people against their will, as if they were puppets in the hands of the Shichibukai...",

        "description": "As King Riku continues to ransack his kingdom for no apparent reason, his daughter Viola fails to understand her father\u0027s behavior. Through Mone, who had betrayed her trust by posing as a simple servant, she watches helplessly as Don Quixote\u0027s crew, Doflamingo, enter the Royal Palace. In the face of the incomprehension and agony of the people of Dressrosa, the man who is to become the country\u0027s new king appears, the improvised hero Doflamingo, accompanied by his three most loyal lieutenants: Pica, Trebol and Diamante. King Riku is defeated and peace is restored to Dressrosa. Doflamingo is appointed the kingdom\u0027s new sovereign.\nBack to the present. At the Coliseum Corrida, Rebecca continues to endure the attacks of her opponents, under the insults of the public who had not forgotten King Riku\u0027s treachery towards his people ten years earlier. At the same time, the Lightning-Fury Soldier continues his story in front of Ussop, Robin, Franky and the Dwarves. The Toy Soldier is determined to inform his people of Doflamingo\u0027s true nature and his premeditated coup d\u0027\u00e9tat to clear King Riku, who was framed by him. He then confesses that Viola is the other name of Violette, the traitorous member of Don Quixote\u0027s crew Doflamingo, who had to work for the new king of Dressrosa in exchange for her father\u0027s life. Soldier Lightning Fury concludes his story by informing his new allies that the toys the Straw Hats had encountered on their arrival on the island were in fact dissident citizens, hostile to Doflamingo\u0027s policies and who hated him for turning them into toys.\nAt the same time, in the basement of the Colosseum, former King Riku discusses the past with Don Chinjao, while Boo, Abdullah and Jeet, transformed into toys by Sugar, slavishly head for the Smile Factory to work. Nearby, Luffy runs like hell to find Zorro, who is outside the Colosseum with Kinemon, and finally finds them without needing Bartolomeo\u0027s help...",

This man, who had been supported by Luffy during the tournament, seems to have malicious intentions towards him. Armed with a dagger, Bellamy is about to attack Luffy, but abruptly changes his mind. Cursing himself for having lost the opportunity to be admitted into the Doflamingo Family, he is approached by Dellinger, who mocks his incompetence in carrying out a direct order from his superior.\nMeanwhile, on the iron bridge linking Green Bit to Dressrosa, Trafalgar Law and Doflamingo continue their fierce battle, but Luffy\u0027s ally is no match for his adversary and quickly loses his fight with him. At the same time, Diamante calls her captain by snail phone to inform him of Violette\u0027s betrayal. Doflamingo orders his henchman to send Lao G to the entrance of the Smile Factory to prevent the Straw Hat Pirates from destroying it. After hanging up, the master of Dressrosa approaches Law to confess that he knew about his plan. Trafalgar Law, defeated though he was, laughed at his conqueror, who then inflicted a mortal blow...\nOutside the Coliseum Corrida, Luffy is delighted to have reunited with his companions. But his enthusiasm attracts the attention of a Navy soldier belonging to Vice-Admiral Bastille\u0027s company, who recognizes Zoro despite his disguise. He immediately reports his discovery to his superior, who suspects that Lucy is actually Luffy, captain of the Straw Hat Crew. However, he doesn\u0027t remember the missing gladiators Boo, Xai and Abdullah, who have been turned into toys by Sugar.\nAt the same time, the Straw Hats hold a summit meeting using snail phones and share their knowledge to date. Zoro and Kinemon inform Sanji that they have found Luffy. The Straw Hat Crew\u0027s cook, who is aboard the Sunny with Nami, Chopper, Brook, Momonosuke and their prisoners, Caesar Clown and Jora, decides to return to Dressrosa while Franky asks permission to help King Riku\u0027s Army revolution, knowing that Luffy would surely agree with him. His hunch was justified, as the Straw Hat unblinkingly supports the initiative taken by the crew\u0027s carpenter, much to the amazement of Usopp and Robin.\nAs Admiral Fujitora arrives on the banks of the Dressrosa with his men, he hears a great ruckus in the city, with explosions and buildings reduced to dust. He soon sees Law lying unconscious on the ground and Doflamingo standing on the ground just outside the Colosseum, close to where Zoro and Kinemon are standing. Satisfied to have finally defeated his opponent, Doflamingo pulls out a pistol and fires three shots at Law in front of Vice-Admiral Bastille, the people of Dressrosa and Luffy, who witness the scene...",

        "description": "As the members of the Straw Hat Crew, scattered across the kingdom, try to find out what\u0027s going on, Doflamingo addresses the citizens of Dressrosa. He apologizes for all the commotion, and explains that Law is solely responsible for the false news in the morning paper about the resignation of his privileges. Witnessing the scene, Luffy calls out to his adversary and asks why he shot his friend. The Grand Corsair replies that it\u0027s none of his business, and that all he\u0027s done is \u0022educate\u0022 his subordinate.\nSeeing their ally in a bad way, Zoro decides to intervene, while Kinemon takes charge of saving Law, informing their companions beforehand of what has just happened. But before the Marine soldiers can do anything to stop them, Admiral Fujitora appears, blocks Zoro\u0027s sword and sends him underground using his power. The samurai tries to rescue Zoro, but is struck down by Doflamingo, who has returned to the charge. Luffy, for his part, tries to help his friends, but is trapped in the bars of the Colis\u00e9e Corrida, which are forged from Sea Granite. Faced with this situation, Kinemon reveals to everyone that the man accompanying Doflamingo is none other than a Navy Admiral, news that shocks the other Straw Hats still free. At the same time, Zoro manages to free himself from the gravitational pull holding him captive and returns to the fight.\nSuddenly, Fujitora and Doflamingo soar above their opponents (thanks to their respective abilities), taking Law with them to the Royal Palace to finish their conversation. The Celestial Demon tells the Admiral that he can do whatever he likes with the Straw Hats, provided he lends a hand. Issho declares that he\u0027ll make a decision once they\u0027ve finished talking. The Navy troops decide to begin their assault to capture Kinemon and Zoro. Zoro tells Luffy that he must find the way out to save Law; the Straw Hat tells them that their ally is still alive, despite appearances.\nAt the same time, Zoro, Kinemon and Luffy hear the panicked cries of Sanji\u0027s group over the snail phone. The latter is being pursued by a strange ship whose prow is singing and staring at them. Brook and the others discover that the ship threatening them belongs to Big Mom\u0027s Crew!!!\nWhile Zoro manages to defeat his pursuers, his companions remaining on the Sunny catch sight of Pekoms and Tamago, two old acquaintances they met on Fishman\u0027s Island, intent on capturing Caesar Clown and sinking the Straw Hat ship!!! Punk Hazard\u0027s former master begs his captors not to let him be captured. Indeed, he confesses to having swindled Big Mom\u0027s research funds in the past. The pirates of this fearsome buccaneer begin their cannonball assault on the Sunny. However, Sanji manages to send one of the cannonballs back into the sea while Brook has taken the helm, steering the Sunny away from Dressrosa. Luffy\u0027s ship manages to dodge the attacks of her adversaries, who do not disarm and continue to fire cannonballs at her.\nWhile the crew of the Sunny try to save their lives, Franky, in the headquarters of King Riku\u0027s army, explains to Sanji that he can\u0027t bring an Emperor to the island, otherwise the plan of the Lightning Fury Soldier and the Dwarves will fail. At the same time, Luffy, looking for a way out of the Coliseum Corrida, learns that Caesar is still aboard the Sunny. Zoro, who is still being pursued by Navy soldiers, tells him that the negotiations between Law and Doflamingo have gone so badly wrong as to change all their plans. For her part, Nami supports Franky\u0027s proposal, explaining that she and her companions must not return to Dressrosa for three reasons: to prevent Doflamingo from recovering Caesar Clown and Momonosuke, to enable Franky, Robin and Usopp to destroy the Smiles Factory, and to ensure that Law\u0027s sacrifice was in vain.\nFaced with this new danger, the Straw Hat pirates realize that they must keep their new enemies at a safe distance from Dressrosa if they are to accomplish all their plans. Luffy orders Sanji, Nami, Brook and Chopper to flee and wait for them on the next island, Zou. However, Sanji asks his captain for permission to attack Big Mom\u0027s boat. Luffy agrees, while Franky takes charge of destroying Doflamingo\u0027s factory. The Straw Hat gives the go-ahead before ordering Zoro and Kinemon to leave for the Royal Palace to rescue Law and defeat Doflamingo.\nAt the same time, in the Coliseum Corrida, the Battle Royal of Block D continues to rage to the cheers of the audience. A mysterious man in a strange top hat is biding his time...",

Luffy\u0027s former enemy tries everything in his power to defend himself, but is no match for his opponent\u0027s agility. Bellamy tries to flee using his powers, but is quickly caught by Dellinger. Just as Dellinger was about to deliver the coup de gr\u00e2ce, Bellamy, who was lying badly wounded, was saved by Bartolomeo, who erected an impenetrable barrier between Dellinger and his prey. Suddenly, Doflamingo\u0027s subordinate receives a call on his snail phone from Diamante, instructing him to leave Bellamy and follow other orders from the King of Dressrosa: to guard the House of Toys with Lao G. But Dellinger is stubborn and desperately tries to break down the barrier created by Bartolomeo, who resists his kicks. Defeated, he gives up, obeying Diamante\u0027s orders, much to Bartolomeo\u0027s delight and Bellamy\u0027s relief, who realizes that he had been fooled by Doflamingo into ordering one of his minions to kill him. Bartolomeo tries to give him first aid, but Bellamy refuses his help, preferring to die. The winner of the Battle Royale of Block B disagrees, assuring Bellamy that he will never abandon a war brother in need.\nAt the same time, in the Flower Field, the Lightning Fury Soldier explains to Usopp, Robin and Franky the layout of the underground factory and the Trading Port in order to free the toy slaves and dwarves being held prisoner. The Toy Soldier also reveals the identity of the Demon Fruit user responsible for turning human beings into toys, and the frightening nature of his powers. It\u0027s Sugar, one of the main members of Don Quixote Doflamingo\u0027s crew, and his defeat will cancel its spell for good. Franky and Usopp are enthusiastic about this plan and decide to join in this major operation, much to the delight of the Tontattas tribe.\nMeanwhile, inside the Coliseum Corrida, Luffy is desperately searching for a way out. He soon comes face to face with Bartolomeo and Bellamy. The Straw Hat is reluctant to give up Ace\u0027s Demon Fruit, but he has no choice as his friend, Trafalgar Law, is in grave danger. Fortunately, Bartolomeo promises that he will win the Mera Mera no Mi and personally give it to Luffy, which is what he had planned to do all along. However, a man appears and claims that no one has the right to possess this Demon Fruit but him. Bartolomeo is outraged at the way the stranger has dared to speak to his idol. The latter suddenly starts crying when the mysterious stranger takes off his strange top hat and speaks to him as if they\u0027ve known each other all their lives...\nHaving found his way out, Luffy meets up with Zoro and Kinemon in the square in front of the Colosseum. Forced to disguise themselves as toy-like animals to avoid being spotted by the Navy soldiers searching for the three fugitives, Zoro asks Luffy why he can\u0027t stop crying. Luffy tells him that everything is fine and that Mera Mera no Mi is in good hands.\nElsewhere, in the middle of an alleyway, Koala, a member of the Revolutionary Army, is in escargophonic communication with the man who had met Luffy. The latter has taken his place in the tournament, carefully donning his battle gear to pass himself off as Luffy. He informs his accomplice that he has found the Straw Hat, while crying his eyes out. He also promises that he\u0027ll win Ace\u0027s Demon Fruit because he\u0027s inherited his will. For his part, Luffy is still reeling from the fact that the stranger he had met in the Coliseum Corrida was in fact someone dear to him whom he had thought dead for a long time...",

        "description": "Luffy, Zoro and Kinemon, disguised as animals, continue to run through the streets of Dressrosa\u0027s capital. The Straw Hat hasn\u0027t stopped crying, to the astonishment of his friends, since he discovered that someone dear to him was still in the world. He confessed to them that he had found his brother, without saying his real name. With tears of joy in his eyes, Luffy recalls his childhood on Dawn Island with Ace and Sabo, and the sake ceremony that made them brothers.\nAt the same time, at Riku Army HQ, Franky\u0027s group and the Dwarves of the Kingdom of Tontatta are on their way to the Smile Factory. The Lightning Fury soldier explains that they\u0027ll have to use the underground tunnel the Dwarves have dug to get directly to the Trading Port. Kabu reminds them that the target to be eliminated is Sugar, special agent of the Don Quixote Family and holder of the Hobi Hobi no Mi, and that once she is defeated, the living toys will become human again! Unfortunately, the underground tunnel was too small for Franky. The Toy Soldier advises him to reach them via the House of Toys at the base of the plateau on which the Royal Palace stands. This is where all the kingdom\u0027s toys return every night. The cyborg has no choice but to pass through one of the four entrances to the House of Toys, all of which are heavily guarded. That way, he can save time and let the others take care of Sugar.\nFranky dashes through the city streets and soon arrives at one of the four entrances to the House of Toys to find himself face to face with Se\u00f1or Pink, a baby-like member of Don Quixote Doflamingo\u0027s crew, who is guarding the entrance, surrounded by young women and his subordinates. The latter immediately identify Franky as an important member of the Straw Hat Crew, who rush to attack the entrance with a \u0022Coup de Vent\u0022 that violently smashes the eastern fa\u00e7ade of the House of Toys.\nAt the same time, in the Royal Palace, Doflamingo is deep in conversation with Admiral Fujitora when he overhears the commotion coming from the House of Toys, along with Diamante, Pica and Tr\u00e9bol. The latter reassures Sugar that the Straw Hats are after the Smile Factory, not the Toy House. By the way, everyone in Dressrosa, with the exception of the ruling class, is unaware of Sugar\u0027s existence. And should they manage to get in, Doflamingo\u0027s prot\u00e9g\u00e9e can easily turn them into toys with her power.\nMeanwhile, in the underground passageway, Operation SOP is well underway. The flying squadrons of the Tontatta tribe take this route to the Trading Port, along with the Toy Soldier, the Dwarves, Robin and Usopp. The Lightning-Fury Soldier takes this opportunity to ask if Franky will be all right, but Usopp replies that there\u0027s nothing to worry about, and that he\u0027ll be able to defeat his opponents easily. But the one-legged soldier informs him that the four entrances to the House of Toys are protected by four high-ranking officers of the Don Quixote Family, members of the Army of Diamante. They are also big stars of the Coliseum Corrida, and each of them has a 100% chance of winning a tournament.\nBack in front of the House of Toys. Franky valiantly fights off Se\u00f1or Pink\u0027s subordinates, who shoot at him as their leader sneaks up from behind, \u0022swimming\u0022 towards the cyborg. Not wanting to use the element of surprise, he stands up to Franky with the intention of introducing himself, but receives a violent punch that sends him flying into the entrance of the House of Toys. To everyone\u0027s surprise, Se\u00f1or Pink gets up and returns to Franky before using his mysterious power once again, making him disappear into the ground as if by magic.\nNearby, the Dwarves continue their progress through the underground passage. Leo explains to Usopp and Robin the various members of the Donquixote Family, as well as the identities and strengths of the agents who carry out the operations. Doflamingo is the leader of this dangerous organization, followed by the \u0022Top 3\u0022 composed of Trebol, Diamante and Pica, each of whom leads a special army. First there\u0027s the \u0022Ace of Clubs\u0022 army, specializing in the use of special Demon Fruit powers and made up of Trebol, Sugar, Violet and Jora. Next comes the army of the \u0022Ace of Diamonds\u0022, specializing in close combat and comprising Diamante, Lao G, Machvise, Se\u00f1or Pink and Dellinger. Finally comes the \u0022Ace of Spades\u0022 army, specialized in special operations and made up of Pica, Gladius, Buffalo and Baby 5. These last two characters are old acquaintances of the Straw Hats, as Usopp remembers taking them down with Nami\u0027s help when he was at Punk Hazard. There are also two outside members, Vergo and Mone, who died when the Straw Hat Crew tried to capture Caesar Clown.\nMeanwhile, in the Coliseum Corrida, the Battle Royale of Block D continues to rage. Rebecca fights like hell to stay alive, taking on all her opponents with the help of Acilia, who has become her great ally. However, together they must fight Suleyman the \u0022Neckbreaker\u0022, who proves to be a tough fighter and hard to beat.\nAt the same time, the Dwarves and their allies soon reach the end of the tunnel and discover that they are in fact underneath the Colosseum. Usopp and Robin catch sight of a huge underground port, which surprises the Straw Hat Crew sniper with its sheer size...",

        "description": "At the Colis\u00e9e Corrida, the D Block Battle Royale is about to come to an end. Only thirty or so fighters remain in the ring, including Rebecca. Rebecca is about to face the terrible Suleyman, the Neckbreaker. He attacks her without warning, and a terrible battle begins between the two warriors. All around them, many fighters are engaged in battle, including Acilia and Orlumbus, who has just defeated a ferocious lion with a single stroke of his whip.\nSuddenly, Rebecca loses her sword and finds herself at the mercy of her opponent, who is ready to cut her to pieces to satisfy the Coliseum Corrida audience, who are dying to see the granddaughter of former King Riku perish. But Acilia intervenes and saves her young friend\u0027s life in extremis. She is seriously injured, however, and Rebecca understands the devotion of her colleague, who was her only ally in the tournament. Fiercely defending Rebecca, Acilia battles Suleyman, who defeats her without a fight. Mortally wounded, Acilia collapses in the ring. Rebecca runs to her side, crying. The valiant fighter begs her to hold on no matter what until the final, before breathing her last. Crying her eyes out, Rebecca vows victory, then picks up her sword and once again faces Suleyman in a fierce battle.\nMeanwhile, Luffy and his friends, still disguised as animals, head for the Royal Palace to rescue Trafalgar Law. Suddenly, Kinemon points out that Zoro has disappeared. Thinking that their companion has once again fallen victim to his poor sense of direction, the young pirate and the samurai don\u0027t look for him and decide to continue on their way to rescue Law from Doflamingo\u0027s clutches. For his part, Zoro realizes he\u0027s lost again. Suddenly, he is attacked by three rascals who mistake him for a \u0022moray cat\u0022. One of them tries to touch one of his swords. Zoro slaps him in front of his friends. The little boy starts crying, causing a huge commotion among the inhabitants of Dressrosa, who are horrified to discover that a toy has dared to raise his hand to a human! Feeling the heat, Zoro flees without a second thought. But he is soon pursued through the city streets by two armed guards who are desperate to stop this \u0022dangerous toy\u0022.\nAfter losing his pursuers, Zoro manages to find Luffy and Kinemon running towards the Royal Palace. They notice that their friend is accompanied by a young Dwarf, Wicca, who guides them to the palace entrance. She informs them that Operation SOP has already begun. Indeed, under Dressrosa, in the Commercial Port where numerous ships from all over the world are moored, numerous toys are busy carrying heavy loads.\nConcealed behind containers, Usopp learns from Leo, the Dwarves\u0027 leader, that the Lightning Fury Soldier has left to assassinate Doflamingo, leaving the Straw Hat Crew sniper at the head of the Royal Forces of the Riku Army to put Sugar out of action. Faced with this titanic task, the Dwarves reveal to Ussop and Robin the plan of Dressrosa\u0027s basement, before Leo shows them the Executive Tower where their target is located. Suddenly, they are spotted by two guards making their rounds. The guards are quickly incapacitated by the Dwarves, who strip them of their clothes before being knocked unconscious by Leo and Inhel before the astonished eyes of the two pirates. The two Dwarves give them the clothes of the two guards, so that Usopp and Robin can pass unnoticed through these secret installations. Intoxicated by the glory, Ussop takes command and invites the Dwarves to head for the Executive Tower to neutralize Sugar.\nNot far away, a large number of soldiers in Doflamingo\u0027s pay have come to the elevator after being informed of a fight between Franky and Se\u00f1or Pink at the east entrance to the House of Toys. Hiding inside a crate with some Dwarves from the Tontatta tribe, Soldier Lightning Fury hears this news. Seeing there\u0027s no other choice, the Toy Soldier assaults the guards in the elevator to take control of it. As he fights against them, the Lightning-Fury Soldier remembers the long training sessions given to Rebecca to make the best use of all the power of her human instincts to avoid being hurt and to fight very quickly. In doing so, he confirms his goal of returning Dressrosa to the Riku family, who are its rightful rulers.\nAt the same time, at the Coliseum Corrida, a strange attack occurs, with the result that each fighter in the arena is knocked out one after the other, like dominoes. The spectators in the stands, like Gats, Bartolomeo and Lucy, don\u0027t understand what has just happened. But suddenly, a mysterious figure staggers to his feet...",

        "description": "As the dust settles, the spectators at the Coliseum Corrida are surprised to find that the last fighter left standing is Rebecca, who automatically wins the D Block Battle Royal to the dismay of Gats and the entire crowd. Soon rumors of cheating spread throughout the Coliseum, but Rebecca is the only person who knows what really happened in the ring.\nAt the same time, outside the building, Vice-Admiral Bastille explains to a Navy soldier that he has come to Dressrosa to search for a certain pirate by the name of Hakuba, who turns out to be Cavendish\u0027s double personality when Cavendish is asleep. He then recalls events in the Kingdom of Rommel, where an elusive man had managed to elude the Navy years ago thanks to his dangerous technique.\nStill booed by the crowd at the Colis\u00e9e Corrida, Rebecca watches Cavendish lying unconscious in the ring. Suddenly, she remembers what happened during the fight when she was confronting the terrible Suleyman, who was after her life. The young gladiatrix had noticed that Cavendish had fallen asleep in the middle of the battle. The other warriors noticed this too, and took advantage of the situation to attack her. But Cavendish, by falling asleep, had brought out his dark side, Hakuba, who defeated everyone in the ring except Rebecca, who managed to dodge his attack in-extremis using her Observation Haki.\nBartolomeo and Lucy witnessed Rebecca\u0027s victory from the rostrum, as did Jesus Burgess, who couldn\u0027t wait to face such a gladiator. Watching her opponents still unconscious, the young woman picks up her helmet and heads for the grandstand, satisfied to finally be in the final to win the Mera Mera no Mi.\nMeanwhile, in front of the east entrance to the House of Toys, Franky is forced to face Se\u00f1or Pink, who warms up before the fight before the cyborg\u0027s incredulous eyes. But the Doflamingo Family member uses his power to thwart the attack of the Straw Hat Crew\u0027s carpenter, who discovers, astonished, that his enemy is extremely tough.\nAt the same time, in the Royal Palace, Doflamingo stands before the chained former King Riku. He discusses Rebecca\u0027s participation in the tournament and Violette\u0027s betrayal. The former ruler of Dressrosa thought that the false news of Doflamingo\u0027s abdication, which CP-0 had denied to the people of Dressrosa that very morning, might have brought some hope, but he was soon disillusioned. Especially as Trafalgar Law was also in the same room as him, chained, unconscious and entirely at the mercy of his worst enemy. The latter boasts that Luffy, allied with Law, could one day beat him. Doflamingo, on the other hand, knows that Franky is at loggerheads with Se\u00f1or Pink, a prominent member of his crew, and undermines the ability of Zoro, Kinemon, Robin and Usopp to reach the underground level of Dressrosa where the Trading Port is located.\nNearby, Robin and Usopp use their disguises to enter the underground port, helping the Dwarves to advance towards the Executive Tower, while at the foot of the King\u0027s Plateau, Luffy, Zoro, Kinemon, still in disguise and aided by Wicca, arrive at the elevator leading to the Royal Palace. Using this exit, they can also reach the House of Toys and the Trading Port, before making their way to the Smiles Factory to destroy it. Just as they\u0027re about to use it, Viola joins them and announces that she\u0027s going to help them...",

But Gats reassures the Coliseum crowd that Diamante, the national hero, will take part in the tournament in place of his prestigious colleagues.\nAs the crowd cheers their new champion, Rebecca wanders into the corridors of the huge amphitheatre and sees many of the wounded from Block D around her, including Cavendish and Acilia. The young gladiator thanks Acilia for helping her win this terrible battle. Suddenly, she finds herself face to face with Lucy, accompanied by Bartolomeo, winner of Block B. She tells him that she is also in the final, but notices that \u0022Lucy\u0022 is not the same person she had known before.\nAt the same time, on the King\u0027s Plateau, Viola advises Luffy, Zoro and Kinemon against using the elevator linking the Royal Palace to the Port of Commerce, after telling them that she is a former subordinate of Doflamingo, as well as the Princess of Dressrosa.\nNot far away, the battle for the House of Toys continues to rage. Franky is still fighting Se\u00f1or Pink, but now he has to face Machvise. Suddenly, Marine soldiers appear and surround the House of Toys, intent on arresting Franky. As Vice-Admiral Bastille\u0027s troops fire on him, the cyborg is forced to fight the Navy against his will.\nAt the same time, in the Royal Palace, Fujitora reveals to Doflamingo that he is in favor of the total abolition of the \u0022Royal Grand Corsair\u0022 system, because, in his opinion, a pirate of Doflamingo\u0027s ilk should not rule a country like Dressrosa. The Shichibukai takes this admission as a threat and violently attacks the Navy Admiral. However, Fujitora admits to Doflamingo that he won\u0027t intervene until the Straw Hat Crew has attacked the people of Dressrosa. He also adds that he\u0027ll deal with Doflamingo when the whole thing is over.\nAfter Viola reveals who she really is, she leads Luffy, Zoro and Kinemon to a secret passage leading to the Royal Palace. She claims that Doflamingo himself is unaware of her existence. Although the stairs are still available, the Straw Hat group prefers to take a basket elevator to save time, with Luffy acting as a counterweight using his Gomu Gomu no Mi powers.\nNot far away, in the Colis\u00e9e Corrida, Gats announces to the entire crowd that the grand finale of the tournament to win the Mera Mera no Mi is about to begin. Backstage, a young woman desperately runs through the corridors to reach a grandstand overlooking the Colosseum arena.

But Diamante is there to restore order and neutralizes the three hapless warriors by revealing the powers of her Demon Fruit. This respected member of the Donquixote Family announces to the competitors that a new element has been added to spice up this final, the prize of which is always Mera Mera no Mi, the Demon Fruit that once belonged to Ace aux Poings Ardents, a new kind of Fighting Fish with a face strangely resembling that of a buffalo. All the competitors notice that the box containing the coveted prize has been strapped to the back of one of these strange animals. Diamante harangues the crowd, announcing that if one of his opponents grabs the box and is the last man standing in the ring, he will be declared the winner of the tournament. Knowing what they had to do, the battle for the Mera Mera no Mi begins for Lucy, Bartolomeo, Jesus Burgess and Rebecca.\nIn the modified ring of the Coliseum Corrida, Jesus Burgess begins the hostilities with a surprise attack on Lucy. The latter dodges him easily and starts running along the pool to attract the Fighting Fish. One of them emerges and tries to grab Lucy, who escapes at lightning speed after realizing that the animal that had just swooped down on him didn\u0027t have the precious box on its back. Lucy tried with a second one, which didn\u0027t have the Mera Mera no Mi either.

But Luffy does not let his head drop, attacking the guards of the Tour des Remparts head-on as his companions look on in bewilderment.

His companions, Zoro, Viola and Kinemon, follow close behind, overpowering the Royal Palace guards with their own talents. In their haste, Wicca almost loses her life, but is quickly saved by Kinemon. Zoro asks him to stay with her, but the proud samurai refuses, arguing that he must go immediately to the House of Toys to free his friend Kanjuro, who is being held prisoner. Wicca also wants to accompany him there, as she wants to take part in Operation SOP, which had already begun. Knowing what they had to do, Wicca and Kinemon leave their friends behind and take the stairs down to the House of Toys in the basement.\nOutside the Royal Palace, guards gather to apprehend the intruders. After separating from Kinemon, they continue their search for Doflamingo\u0027s hiding place when the torches are suddenly extinguished one by one. They then have the unpleasant surprise of seeing a palace wall suddenly transform into a huge stone monster that rises up in front of them. Viola tells Luffy and Zoro that they must face Pica, a prominent member of the Doflamingo Family, who had eaten the Ishi Ishi no Mi, a Demon Fruit that allows its user to assimilate and control stone, in order to emerge or cover his body with it. Doflamingo\u0027s henchman uses this power as he attempts to eliminate the Straw Hats by flattening them. But Luffy doesn\u0027t give in and uses his own talents to take down this cumbersome adversary.\nHowever, Pica hasn\u0027t said his last as he gets back up and attacks the Straw Hat once again, and his friends realize that they\u0027re up against a tough enemy with the power to assimilate all the stones in the Royal Palace. This is not lost on him, who manages to apprehend the intruders by smashing two walls over them.\nMeanwhile, at the eastern entrance to the House of Toys, the battle continues to rage. Vice-Admiral Bastille\u0027s soldiers attempt to shoot Franky dead. But the cyborg\u0027s body is invulnerable to rifle bullets! Se\u00f1or Pink, annoyed at the Navy\u0027s meddling, tries to intervene, but is manhandled by one of the soldiers. Suddenly, Bastille intervenes and calms things down by making him understand that his superior, Issho, is in talks with Doflamingo as part of an agreement between the Navy and the Doflamingo family. For his part, Franky loses patience and attacks the Navy soldiers with rockets. Dismayed, the latter abandon their position, but Vice-Admiral Bastille orders them to use a new type of cannon whose projectiles fired at Franky immediately ignite the cyborg\u0027s entire body.\nSuffering a thousand deaths, Franky tries to escape the flames that are eating away at him, but to the delight of Bastille\u0027s men, in vain. But Franky\u0027s weakness was only a decoy, for to the amazement of the Marine soldiers, the cyborg rises again as if nothing had happened. He even continued to taunt his opponents, who fired at him out of spite.\nNot far away, in the Port of Commerce, the group led by Usopp manages to reach Sugar, who has turned Cavendish into a toy, and Trebol sends him off with his fellow toys, Xai, Hack and the great King Elizabello II, to work for the rest of their lives in the Port of Commerce. After this incident, the Dwarves, Usopp and Robin manage to sneak unseen inside the Control Tower. There, Leo reveals to Usopp the plan they\u0027ve concocted, namely to slip an extremely pungent grape, made from Tatababasco sauce, into Sugar\u0027s bowl. Sugar is so fond of grapes that she eats them constantly. Leo\u0027s plan is very simple: he needs Sugar to pass out after eating the tampered grape to break the curse that affects all Dressrosa\u0027s toys. Usopp agrees to the plan, and Leo begins Operation SOP, which could well shake the entire kingdom and show its inhabitants the true face of Doflamingo...",

        "description": "In the underground Trading Port, in front of the Executive Tower, Leo is about to put the fake grape he\u0027d managed to make from Tatababasco into Sugar\u0027s bowl, but he\u0027s stopped by Robin who, along with Usopp, has discovered the dangerous power of Trebol, who had eliminated a fly that had dared to bother him.\nMeanwhile, the ultimate battle for the Mera Mera no Mi continues to rage in the Coliseum Corrida. Gats is very enthusiastic, and in his commentary captures the audience\u0027s excitement at such a spectacle when he sees a new Fighting Fish emerge from the water to attack Jesus Burgess. The latter, far from being impressed by the animal, brings it down with a single punch using his powers, shaking the Colosseum to its foundations. His devastating power impresses the amphitheater crowd and Rebecca alike.\nSuddenly, another Fighting Fish emerges from the water, carrying on its back the box containing the Demon Fruit. All the tournament participants have spotted the animal and are preparing to fight it for the precious booty. But soon other Fighting Fish appear and join the first to attack all five fighters in the ring. Bartolomeo and Diamante easily take down several Fighting Fish, while Lucy is more interested in the one with the Mera Mera no Mi. The latter chooses to attack Rebecca, who defends herself as best she can but is no match for such an opponent. Lucy chooses this moment to jump on the animal\u0027s back to open the box on its back. Diamante is not pleased by her audacity and wants to get her hands on the Demon Fruit. A fierce battle ensues between the two competitors, but Lucy manages to break Diamante\u0027s sword blade using her staff.\nHowever, Lucy\u0027s prowess attracts the attention of Jesus Burgess, who is about to launch a lightning punch to bring down the Fighting Fish carrying the precious casket. Lucy stops him by using her haki and the dragon\u0027s claw technique, which shatters his attacker\u0027s armour to the delight of Gats and the audience. Bartolomeo is beside himself with joy at this prodigy, while Diamante wonders if the fighter he has in front of him is really Luffy. For her part, Rebecca realizes that she\u0027s not up to the level required to take part in the final of the Battle Royale. On the verge of giving up, she rethinks the words of her mentor and friend Acilia and finally pulls herself together by attacking Diamante from behind.\nAt the same time, in the elevator leading up to the Royal Palace, Soldier Lightning Fury finally overcomes the last guard to the cheers of the few Dwarves accompanying him. Suddenly, a terrifying adversary appears from nowhere. It\u0027s Lao G, a prominent member of the Donquichotte family, who takes down the Toy Soldier with a lightning-fast punch before his friends\u0027 very eyes. The latter try to help him, but are quickly overpowered by Lao G, who vows not to let these intruders reach the Palais Royal.\nNot far away, in the Tower of the Ramparts, Luffy, Zoro and Viola have a run-in with Pica, transformed into a huge stone statue thanks to his power, which crushes sections of wall on them. But the Straw Hat uses his gifts to save his friends in extremis. Zoro uses his Shuusui to fight his way to freedom, taking Viola with him. For his part, Luffy attacks Pica, who seems invulnerable to his punches. Zoro then takes over and tries to cut down his opponent with his sabers, but the latter lifts a section of wall to stop his assailant. Luffy goes back to punching Pica, who again uses the same technique to try and eliminate the intruders.\nThe din of battle reaches Kinemon, who is descending the stairs to the House of Toys. Pica\u0027s ceaseless transformations have considerably altered the architecture of the Palace, to the point of rendering the stairs unusable. This inconvenience comes at just the right time for Wicca, who advises the samurai to go all the way to the surface and take the main elevator, which will take them directly to the right destination. The only catch is that, by using this passage, the Palace\u0027s security will be reinforced. This is not a problem for Kinemon, who deflects it by using his powers to transform himself, before Wicca\u0027s horrified eyes, into a perfect Don Quixote Doflamingo look-alike!\nJust then, at the eastern entrance to the House of Toys, Franky\u0027s battle with the Marine forces continues unabated. Vice-Admiral Bastille decides to put an end to the battle by facing the cyborg alone. Even the officer\u0027s sword blows are no match for Franky, who rises to his feet as if nothing had happened, before the astonished eyes of the soldiers and Dellinger, who has come to see Se\u00f1or Pink. Dellinger asks his young comrade not to meddle in his affairs, while Luffy manages to break Pica\u0027s stone hand and one of his legs. The monstrous statue collapses heavily to the ground.\nLuffy and his friends flee, thinking they\u0027ve defeated the stone man once and for all, but he gets back up and regenerates his lost limbs. He then sets off in pursuit of the three intruders, who discover that it is very difficult for them to take down such an adversary. Once again trapping them by erecting a wall, Zoro manages to destroy it using his three sabers. He then asks Luffy to take Viola with him to continue their mission, while he takes care of Pica on his own, swearing to his friend that he will cut this man of stone to pieces...",

But Pica won\u0027t let the Straw Hat and his companion go, and does everything in his power to stop them. Zoro then goes to the rescue, cutting off the giant\u0027s fingers with his sabers, before continuing to cut him to pieces while Luffy makes his way back to Doflamingo. Just as he thought he\u0027d finally brought down his opponent, Pica emerges from a wall and tries to seize Zoro. But the swordsman is quicker and cuts him in two with a single sword! Pica proves to be a tough foe, however, for no sooner had Zoro knocked him down than he springs to his feet to attack again.\nAt the same time, in the elevator leading to Doflamingo\u0027s lair, the battle between Soldier Lightning Fury and Lao G continues to rage. The two fighters are of equal strength, and the battle is proving fierce. But the Toy Soldier is no match for the officer of the Donflamingo Family. He collapses before the eyes of his companions.\nNot far away, in the Smiles Factory, dwarf slaves have to grow artificial Demon Fruit in appalling conditions. An overseer punishes them for the slightest deviation, and forces them to produce more fruit, making them believe that they are needed to cure Princess Mansherry, who is extremely ill.\nFor their part, Robin and Bee Anne manage to create a diversion by luring Trebol out of the Tower of Control, while the Dwarves face Sugar alone. Before Usopp\u0027s astonished eyes, Leo manages to slip the tampered grape into their enemy\u0027s fruit basket without her noticing. Just as Sugar is about to eat the fruit, she throws it to the ground as if it wasn\u0027t to her liking. Seeing that Operation SOP is about to fail, the Dwarves come out of hiding to confront their adversary. The latter, far from impressed, uses her power to turn half of Leo\u0027s men into little black bears. Once she\u0027s done that, Sugar orders them to kill their comrades, who are astonished to discover that their enemy has little bodyguards, unaware that they are in fact their own friends transformed into toys! While the Baths are fighting each other, Sugar calls for Trebol\u0027s help over the loudspeaker, and Trebol realizes that her friend has been framed. Discovering Robin\u0027s imposture, he immobilizes the young woman in glue, but she escapes using her gifts.

At the same time, Luffy and Viola are still being pursued by Pica, who tries to catch them using his powers. But the Straw Hat doesn\u0027t give in and makes his way to Doflamingo\u0027s lair with his ally. For his part, Zoro continues to shear Pica\u0027s stone body, which regenerates in the blink of an eye as it draws its strength from the palace\u0027s stone blocks.\nNot far away, in the Colosseum Corrida, Rebecca fiercely attacks Diamante, who easily stops her move under the astonished gazes of Gats and the audience. Making a club appear as if by magic, he violently strikes the young warrior with such force as to shatter Rebecca\u0027s helmet! The unconscious Rebecca is now at the mercy of her opponent. Lucy, fighting against Jesus Burgess, asks Bartolomeo to protect the young woman. Meanwhile, Diamante, sure of his success, asks Rebecca how her mother, Scarlett, died when the Toy Soldier couldn\u0027t protect her.\nAt the same time, in the rubble of the Executive Tower, pulverized by the ship launched by Trebol, Robin arrives on the scene to rescue Usopp, who has been knocked unconscious by the building\u0027s collapse. The Straw Hat Crew sniper explains to his friend that he doesn\u0027t know what happened, before discovering that Leo\u0027s men and their leader have been captured by Trebol. The Dwarves, betrayed by their own naivety, reveal to Doflamingo\u0027s henchman that their accomplices are Usoland and the one-legged soldier. Informed, Trebol tells the Dwarves that the glue they\u0027re stuck in is flammable. Throwing away a lighted lighter, he leaves with Sugar, while all that remains of the Executive Tower goes up in smoke before the astonished eyes of Robin and Usopp. They come out of hiding to search for survivors. Usopp finds Leo in a bad way, who had managed to save the fake grape made from Tatababasco from the flames. His face covered in blood, he tells him that Operation SOP was not over. Leo confesses to Usopp that their commander is counting on him and his men if their plan to defeat Doflamingo is to succeed.\nOn the first floor of the Palais Royal, Soldier Lightning Fury suffered a severe beating from Lao G. Just as the latter was about to give him the coup de gr\u00e2ce, the toy soldier recalls his fight with Rebecca over the false rumors of Doflamingo\u0027s resignation from the throne of Dressrosa that very morning. Suddenly, the palace walls tremble and everyone realizes that Pica is up to no good. The surviving Dwarves take advantage of this incident to rescue their leader and take him away from Lao G, telling him that he is the only one who can defeat Doflamingo.\nAt the same time, Usopp can\u0027t understand why the Dwarves should have blind faith in this Toy Soldier. Leo then tells him that the Lightning-Fury Soldier was the first human to be transformed into a toy, but without signing a contract binding him forever to the Doflamingo Family, and that before he was bewitched by Sugar\u0027s powers, he was once the legendary gladiator Kyros...",

The latter fights fiercely against the palace guards, inflicting heavy losses on them with the help of Rambo and Kabu, the two Dwarves accompanying him. But Gladius, one of Doflamingo\u0027s subordinates, stands in his way. Rambo and Kabu step in to give their leader time to become human again and fight Doflamingo. But the fight is unequal for the two Dwarves, who are quickly captured by Gladius.\nThe Lightning Fury Soldier sees his two friends sacrifice themselves for him. He tries to flee from Gladius, who catches him and reveals his talents: he has eaten the Pamu Pamu no Mi, which enables him to shatter, from the inside, any part of his body and any non-organic matter, transforming him into a Lightning Man! Grabbing him by the throat, Gladius tries to use his powers to make the Toy Soldier\u0027s head explode, but Luffy arrives just in time to help him. With a lightning kick, the Straw Hat manages to knock his opponent to the ground and, in extremis, recovers the battered Lightning-Fury Soldier.\nStruggling to his feet, he spots Viola at the pirate\u0027s side. Seeing that the young woman has betrayed Doflamingo\u0027s trust, Gladius tries to eliminate them using his powers. Viola advises her friend to flee as quickly as possible. Mad with rage, Gladius implodes his head, severely injuring Viola after sending a shower of shrapnel at them. Luffy grabs her by the arm and continues running, carrying the Toy Soldier and the beautiful gypsy. Breaking through a window, the trio set off in the direction of the Palais Royal.\nThe three fugitives manage to outrun Gladius, who crosses paths with Kinemon, disguised as Doflamingo thanks to the power of his Demon Fruit. Not recognizing him, his lieutenant informs him that three intruders have entered the Royal Palace and asks him to take cover on the second floor while his men get rid of them. Instead, Doflamingo-Kinemon asks to see Kanjuro. Gladius informs him that the samurai has disappeared from the dump where he was locked up.\nMeanwhile, Luffy, Viola and Private Lightning Fury have arrived at the ceremonial room where Trafalgar Law is being held. The latter is being interrogated by Doflamingo himself, surrounded by Baby 5 and Buffalo, who had previously tortured the former Shichibukai. They also catch a glimpse of former King Riku, who is totally at the mercy of Dressrosa\u0027s new ruler. Luffy and the Toy Soldier are eager to act, but must wait for Leo\u0027s men to finish Operation SOP. Unfortunately, the Dwarves have failed in their attempt to make Sugar faint. Still protected by her bodyguard Trebol, he stops another Dwarf attack on his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, who orders the Dwarves, now transformed into little black bears, to confront their former comrades. Robin can\u0027t let them get away with it, and uses her powers to immobilize Trebol and Sugar, giving Leo time to force the Tatababasco grain down Sugar\u0027s throat. But the young archaeologist\u0027s tactics go awry, as Doflamingo\u0027s accomplice uses her gifts to turn Robin into a rag doll, leaving Usopp in deep distress.

        "description": "In the rubble of the Executive Tower, Trebol has defeated all Leo\u0027s Dwarves, while Robin has been turned into a rag doll by Sugar. Sugar notices the Tatababasco grain abandoned by Leo and picks it up for closer examination. Meanwhile, the archaeologist of the Straw Hat Crew, aware of her condition, desperately searches for Usopp, thinking for a moment that he has forgotten her so that he can help her become human again.\nNot far away, at the eastern entrance to the House of Toys, Franky continues to fire on sight at Dellinger who, thanks to his agility, easily dodges all his bullets and administers a lightning kick to the cyborg, who is knocked to the ground. Marine soldiers take advantage of the situation to machine-gun Franky, but his robotic body seems impervious to their assaults. This exasperates Dellinger, who wanted Franky all to himself. Vice-Admiral Bastille\u0027s soldiers suddenly stop firing and ask the cyborg to surrender, but he refuses. He stands up and launches into the attack, machine-gunning everything in his path, announcing his firm intention to demolish the House of Toys and praying that Usopp will do his duty to ensure the success of Operation SOP.\nMeanwhile, on the second floor of the Royal Palace, in the ceremonial chamber, Trafalgar Law and former King Riku are still Doflamingo\u0027s prisoners. Viola uses her gifts to tell Luffy and Private Lightning Fury that the Tontatta soldiers have been defeated by Trebol. This news doesn\u0027t help the Dwarf leader, while Luffy has absolute confidence in Usopp, the sole survivor of the operation to neutralize Sugar.\nAt the same time, Sugar is closely examining the Tatababasco grape that Leo intended to force down her throat. She suspects that the fake grape is poisoned. Leo, seriously wounded, begs Usoland to come and help him and his men, but the sniper takes fright and flees, leaving behind his friend Robin, still transformed into a toy, and the Dwarves who were counting on him.\nHaving settled the score with the Dwarves, Trebol orders his men to get back to work immediately. They obeyed, forcing the Toys to work harder in the Trading Port. For their part, the defeated Dwarves shout loudly for Usoland to come and help them. This astonishes Trebol, who asks Leo who Usoland is. The leader of the Tontatta soldiers replies that Usoland is their legendary hero, because he will be able to save them, free the toys working in the Trading Port and the Dwarf slaves in the Smiles Factory. Thanks to his bravery, he was able to thwart Sugar\u0027s curse and free half the inhabitants of Dressrosa, who had been turned into toys because of her. But Leo\u0027s words have no effect on Trebol, who tells them that the Dwarves have been fooled and that Usoland is a liar! For his part, Usopp hears the words of the Doflamingo Family officer and continues to flee. But Leo doesn\u0027t believe Trebol\u0027s lies and shouts at him to shut up immediately, telling him that Usoland has never lied.\nLeo\u0027s cries stop Usopp in his tracks for a moment, but the sniper, with tears in his eyes, continues to run instead of retracing his steps to save his friends. Tired of his whining, Trebol silences him by crushing the Dwarf leader with his foot in front of his comrades. This incident causes Usopp great sadness, and he can\u0027t stop running. Trebol takes advantage of the situation to trample more Tontattas, who continue to shout that Usoland is their hero and will come to save them.\nTired of hearing his friends\u0027 cries of pain, Usopp decides to return to the ruins of the Executive Tower to tell his friends the whole truth. He\u0027s not a legendary hero, he\u0027s just a pirate. This confession upsets Leo and his men, who had all believed in Usopp\u0027s sincerity. Meanwhile, Sugar and Trebol catch sight of the Straw Hat Crew\u0027s sniper. To redeem himself, he uses his kabuto to send a projectile at Trebol, who is cut in three before his comrade\u0027s very eyes. This act of bravery sparks a new surge of hope among the Tontattas, who realize that they once again have a savior in Usopp...",

        "description": "Using one of his most effective fighting techniques, Usopp manages to slice Trebol into slices before attacking Sugar, forcing him to swallow Tatababasco\u0027s grain under the admiring eyes of Leo and his men. But Trebol proves to be a very tough opponent for the Straw Hat Crew snipper, as the Doflamingo Family officer comes back to life using the powers of his Demon Fruit. Trebol uses them again in an attempt to eliminate Usopp, who runs for his life to avoid being killed.\nAt the same time, in the ceremonial chamber on the second floor of the Royal Palace, Trafalgar Law and former King Riku are still Doflamingo\u0027s prisoners. Doflamingo receives reports from his soldiers about a man who looks strangely like him and is pretending to be him. For his part, Private Lightning Fury, in the company of Luffy and Viola, sees the state of his former king and is eager to become human again if Operation SOP is successful. Viola informs her companions that her father had taken part in the tournament held in the Coliseum Corrida, but was defeated. At the mention of this heroic act, the toy soldier remembers his past when he was still human.\nWhen the Lightning Fury Soldier was still called Kyros, he was just a common street urchin who committed various misdeeds here and there. The soldiers of Riku\u0027s royal guard had a hard time stopping him, such was the 15-year-old\u0027s fighting ability. Suddenly, the King of Dressrosa appeared and tried to reason with Kyros, but he knocked him down with his nail-studded staff. On the verge of being slaughtered by the soldiers, King Riku orders them to spare the boy\u0027s life. Kyros explains that he had to fight to avenge the death of his best friend, who was murdered for no reason whatsoever. King Riku forgives him and asks him to follow him. Overnight, Kyros left the slums of Dressrosa to become a gladiator in the Coliseum Corrida. Despite his young age, he managed to defeat opponents far more powerful than himself. King Riku promises to free him if Kyros wins a hundred victories. Four months later, the young boy defeated his hundredth adversary and won his freedom. But the public\u0027s fear of seeing such a murderer on the streets of their town again forced Kyros to remain a gladiator for life!\nAs the years went by, Kyros trained to become even stronger. He soon won his two-hundredth victory, then his three-hundredth without anyone being able to beat him. Soon, after four years, Kyros wins his thousandth victory and becomes the crowd favorite at the Colis\u00e9e Corrida. But then, five years later, a mysterious masked warrior named Ricky comes to challenge him as Kyros fights his three-thousandth bout in a row. The latter defeats his new adversary with ease before the eyes of his audience. However, Kyros made an emotional gesture to the vanquished, for he had recognized him: it was King Riku! The latter offers to change his life and forget his nine years of captivity as a gladiator at the Colosseum Corrida. Moved, Kyros accepted the king\u0027s offer and, at the age of 25, became commander of the royal army of Dressrosa.\nHowever, Kyros\u0027s life was turned upside down when he met Scarlett, who had been suspicious of him at first, but changed her mind completely after he rescued her from pirates who had sacked Dressrosa. Madly in love with her savior, Scarlett faked his death so that she could spend the rest of her life with the man she loved. Kyros and his companion had a daughter, whom they named Rebecca. But these happy moments were soon overshadowed when Doflamingo took over Riku\u0027s kingdom...",

        "description": "With the Royal Palace and the lower town in flames, Kyros decides to go and save the life of the King of Dressrosa after leaving his companion, Scarlet, and daughter Rebecca in the safety of the Field of Flowers. But when he arrives at the palace, he comes face to face with four members of Don Quixote\u0027s crew: Doflamingo, Buffalo, Machvise, Jora and Gladius. Alongside these pirates, he spots his young sister-in-law, Viola, escorted by Mone disguised as a servant. The latter asks Kyros to follow her to be presented before the new King of Dressrosa. Perplexed, the former Colosseum Corrida champion follows her without question and arrives in the palace audience hall. As he enters the room, he spots Sugar giving the signal to three of Doflamingo\u0027s henchmen to attack him, chaining Kyros\u0027 left leg. Kyros doesn\u0027t understand what\u0027s happening to him and tries in vain to break his chains using his sword, but it\u0027s no use as his shackles had been forged from Sea Granite.\nKyros suddenly hears the sinister laughter of Doflamingo seated in majesty with a sword in the company of Sugar, Machvise, Buffalo, Jora and Gladius. At the pirate\u0027s feet, the valiant captain of the guard sees King Riku handcuffed and at the mercy of his adversaries. Mad with rage, Kyros tries in vain to break his shackles, much to the delight of Doflamingo, who continues to sneer.\nDoflamingo offers Kyros his loyalty, or else the dethroned king and all the members of the former royal family will die, including Scarlet and Rebecca. But the valiant gladiator refuses to accept this infamous bargain and sacrifices his shackled leg by cutting it with his sword to strike Doflamingo. But Sugar doesn\u0027t give him the chance and transforms him into a common tin soldier with his power, before the astonished eyes of former king Riku.\nDespite being transformed into a toy, Kyros manages to escape from the Royal Palace, taking Riku with him to safety. However, following Sugar\u0027s curse, the former ruler of Dressrosa no longer remembers his former captain of the royal guard! Kyros then tries to protect Scarlett, but the young woman is killed by Diamante as she tries to collect food for Rebecca.\nBack to the present. Viola warns Luffy and Soldier Lightning Fury that Doflamingo\u0027s soldiers led by Gladius are coming to capture them. As their enemies climb the stairs to reach them, the toy soldier hopes that Usoland and the Dwarves have succeeded in their mission without knowing that Operation SOP is a fiasco.\nAt the same time, at the Coliseum Corrida, Jesus Burgess\u0027s attacks on Lucy are considerably weakening the building\u0027s foundations, while Diamante, the better to defeat Rebecca who is sheltered by a barrier created by Bartolomeo, reveals to her that he is the man who murdered her mother. This news upsets the young gladiatrix, who is in a state of shock. She feels responsible for having asked her mother to buy food for her, an act that cost her her life.\nFor his part, Franky is defeated by the combined assault of the Navy soldiers and the members of the Doflamingo Family. He suddenly thinks of Usopp to save Dressrosa. At the same time, in the underground Trading Port, Leo and his men cheer their champion, as do all the toys who silently encourage Usopp to defeat Doflamingo\u0027s henchmen in the ruins of the Executive Tower. Unfortunately, he\u0027s no match for Trebol, who receives a snail phone call from Doflamingo inviting him to take Sugar to the Royal Palace. As a final farewell, Sugar puts Tatababasco\u0027s grain into the defeated Usopp\u0027s mouth and forces it down his throat. But this awakens Usopp, who cries out in pain with a horrible expression on his face that frightens Leo and his men, who had given up hope, and terrifies Sugar to the point where she loses consciousness before the astonished eyes of Trebol, who begins to panic...",

        "description": "While holding Rebecca by one arm, Sabo uses his other arm to completely destroy the Coliseum Corrida ring in order to dig an access to the underground port beneath the building. The young gladiatrix is unaware of the exact identity of the tournament\u0027s winner when Koala arrives with Sabo\u0027s clothes and announces that she has managed to make contact with Hack, who is already in the building.\nAt the same time, in the Port of Commerce, the former gladiators freed from Sugar\u0027s curse acclaim Usopp as a god, while the Dwarves celebrate him as their hero. Usopp, still uplifted by Hajrudin, asks them to destroy the Smiles Factory and restore freedom to the slaves still imprisoned there.\nOn the surface, Rebecca, Sabo and Koala leave the Colis\u00e9e Corrida to head for Hack\u0027s rendezvous, while the former tournament participants and the Tontattas accept their \u0022god\u0027s\u0022 decision to destroy the Smiles Factory. They all set off, despite Trebol\u0027s powerlessness to stop them. But Trebol doesn\u0027t give up and, with Robin watching on, takes Sugar with him, still unconscious, to block the insurgents\u0027 path.\nJust as Usopp was about to ask Hajrudin to put him down, Robin spotted Koala and Sabo, who were still taking Rebecca with them, heading for the factory. For his part, Jesus Burgess, who has landed with the other competitors in the underground port, digs himself out of the rubble of the ring while raging in anger. He is soon joined by Diamante, who doesn\u0027t know how to tell her boss Doflamingo about the whole mess when she sees the former participants of the Colis\u00e9e Corrida storming the Smiles Factory. The Doflamingo Family officer, soon backed up by Trebol, decides to stop them.\nKoala and Sabo manage to find Hack, who is delighted to be reunited with his companions. Rebecca, who had accompanied them, is impressed by the place she is in, which she also didn\u0027t know existed. As Koala hands Sabo his clothes, he reveals to the young gladiatrix and Bartolomeo, who has joined them, that he is the second in command of the Revolutionary Army, along with his friends Koala and Hack, and that the \u0022first\u0022 Lucy was in fact a pirate named Luffy. Sabo then recalls his childhood days on Dawn Island with Luffy and Ace, and their shared dream of one day becoming pirates.\nAfter an emotional recollection of his past, Sabo confesses to Rebecca and Bartolomeo that the Revolutionary Army has come to Dressrosa to put an end to the arms trafficking taking place there, which is permanently aggravating wars around the world. For his part, Koala informs them that the Revolutionary Army has sent soldiers to Dressrosa in the past, but that they have been turned into toys by Sugar. However, Sabo and his companions, unaware that they are being spied on by two Doflamingo guards, realize that the weapons they want to dismantle are not manufactured here but elsewhere on Dressrosa. They set out to find and destroy this manufacturing site.\nAt the same time, in the capital of Dressrosa, chaos breaks out in the city streets as pirates seek revenge on Doflamingo for turning them into toys. The city\u0027s inhabitants are also fleeing terrifyingly ferocious beasts. At the entrance to the House of Toys, Se\u00f1or Pink, Machvise and Dellinger are unable to cope with the situation, as are the Navy soldiers led by Admiral Issho. Not far away, Franky, in a bad way, gets up despite his wounds. He neutralizes a guard to escape, while on the King\u0027s Plateau in front of the Tour des Remparts, Zoro, who had lost sight of Pica, contemplates the city, realizing that something serious has happened.\nOn the first floor, Kinemon, disguised as Doflamingo, asks some angry pirates to let him pass. But the pirates, believing they were dealing with the man responsible for all their misfortunes, fired at him. However, the samurai, still accompanied by Wicca, manages to evade them by climbing to the ceiling of the elevator to avoid being hit by their bullets. Kinemon doesn\u0027t understand what\u0027s happened to him. Wicca, on the other hand, guesses that Operation SOP has been a success and advises her friend to return to his normal appearance immediately, otherwise he won\u0027t be the target of Doflamingo\u0027s former victims. Kinemon obeys this advice and sets off in search of Kanjuro.\nIn the Trading Port, Robin is happy to find Koala, Sabo and Hack, whom she had met during her captivity at Tequila Wolf, and takes the opportunity to introduce them to Usopp. At the same time, at the Royal Palace, Kyros, still driven by his thirst for revenge, has defeated all Doflamingo\u0027s soldiers before attacking Buffalo, who suffers the same fate before Baby 5\u0027s eyes, while Luffy and Viola bring the key that opens Trafalgar Law\u0027s Sea Granite handcuffs. Just as Kyros is about to free the former King Riku, Gladius appears in the room and loses his temper at the sight of his master\u0027s decapitated body. Luffy takes advantage of this moment to try and unlock Law\u0027s handcuffs, who gravely announces that the Pirate Alliance is over and that they are enemies once again. But suddenly, a sinister laugh is heard. Soon, the Straw Hat and his friends see Pica emerge from the stone, while Doflamingo, whom everyone thought dead, begins to speak despite being decapitated. The Shichibukai, who knows what is causing the unrest in Dressrosa, tells them he intends to use the Birdcage to solve the problem, a plan that does not bode well for Trafalgar Law....",

But their attempt is halted by the two elite officers of the Doflamingo Family, who use their respective powers to stop the rebellion.\nElsewhere, in Dressrosa, chaos has reached the streets of the capital, while at the Royal Palace, Doflamingo, even decapitated, is enjoying his revenge. This is too much for Kyros, who is about to strike again at the King of Dressrosa when a second Doflamingo appears and prepares to decapitate the former Coliseum Corrida champion. However, the latter is narrowly saved by Luffy, who then fights with the great corsair for several long minutes. The fight quickly turns to Luffy\u0027s advantage, as he strikes the first blow with a treacherous blow from behind. Viola discovers to her horror that the \u0022Doflamingo\u0022 that Kyros had managed to decapitate was in fact a puppet son. Doflamingo takes advantage of this moment to force former King Riku to remember the tragic events of ten years ago in Dressrosa, while predicting a similar destiny that will soon unfold. Then, annoyed, Doflamingo asks Pica to eject the intruders from the palace while he uses the \u0022Birdcage\u0022 technique, using his clone\u0027s decapitated body to prevent anyone from leaving the island without his permission.\nWitnessing the scene, Trafalgar Law, who has been in this situation before, explains to his companions that one of Doflamingo\u0027s darkest designs is to kill all the inhabitants of Dressrosa to prevent the truth about the country from being revealed to the world. Trapped by this impenetrable barrier, the people of Dressrosa can do nothing, and neither can the Navy soldiers, who can\u0027t call for reinforcements at headquarters because their means of communication are jammed by this strange, demonic \u0022Birdcage\u0022. Suddenly, soldiers and pirates are struck by lightning and start slaughtering each other for no reason at all. Only Issho, who has managed not to get hit, understands what\u0027s going on. Tiny wires strike every inhabitant of the island, inciting them to kill each other to the delight of Doflamingo, who manipulates all his victims like common puppets.\nSuddenly, the island begins to shake and all the inhabitants watch in horror as the King\u0027s Plateau sinks before them. Luffy and his friends on the scene discover that this is the work of Pica. Using his power, Pica raises the palace into the air, causing panic throughout the island. Pica does the same to the Smiles Factory, which flies off along with The Field of Flowers, sucking in the rest of the city, with no one able to do anything about it.\nKnowing that he had now won on all counts, the real Doflamingo addresses all Dressrosa\u0027s citizens by giant skydiving machine, offering them to take part in a game where the first to die loses...",

        "description": "The citizens of Dressrosa and the soldiers of the Navy are doing everything they can to leave the island. But their efforts are doomed to failure, as Doflamingo\u0027s \u0022Birdcage\u0022 in which they are trapped is indestructible. Some people, manipulated by the master of the place, continue to kill indiscriminately without being able to do anything about it. Some try to contact the outside world, but communications are cut off by Doflamingo\u0027s diabolical trap, plunging Dressrosa further into chaos.\nAt the same time, in the underground Trading Port, the disappearance of the Smiles Factory allows the former gladiators of the Colis\u00e9e Corrida to come out into the open while blessing the name of their savior Usopp. For his part, Kinemon finds Robin chatting quietly with his friends Sabo, Koala and Hack. The samurai is suddenly disturbed by Rebecca\u0027s suggestive outfit, while Bartolomeo carefully examines Sniperking\u0027s wanted notice, comparing it with the still unconscious Usopp. He suddenly realizes that he\u0027s dealing with one of the most esteemed members of the Straw Hat Crew. Bartolomeo is excited to be in the company of such a celebrity. This exasperates Sabo, who asks his former tournament opponent to shut up, while Hack recalls that it was Bartolomeo who was the man who broke his arm. Far away from the tumult, Kinemon entrusts Leo\u0027s Tontattas warriors Rambo and Kabu, who have defended their commander to the best of their ability.\nOutside, the streets of Dressrosa\u0027s capital are in total chaos, with everyone remembering the tragic incidents that led former king Riku and his soldiers to massacre his people, and quickly realizing that they had been manipulated by Doflamingo. Doflamingo uses his powers to move his victims like puppets from the Royal Palace. King Riku implores him to stop this cruel game, and Doflamingo takes advantage of this moment to reveal to the entire population the list of bounties awarded to each member of the Straw Hats and their allies - a total of twelve people, classified by different categories, with a bounty of 100 million berries per head!\nFirst there\u0027s the one-star group, which includes Rebecca, the granddaughter of former King Riku, Robin, Kinemon, Viola and Franky. Next comes the two-star group, which includes Kyros, Rebecca\u0027s father, and Zoro. Then comes the three-star group featuring Sabo, second-in-command of the Revolutionary Army, Luffy, Trafalgar Law and Riku Doldo III, former ruler of Dressrosa. To make matters worse, Doflamingo reveals that Usopp is the one holding the biggest bounty, as he is responsible for all the misfortunes that have befallen the island!\nThe bounty of 500 million berries promised on Usopp\u0027s head attracts the greed of former gladiators who want to get their hands on him. Sabo advises his friends to escape to the surface, while Kinemon abandons them to rescue his friend Kanjuro, who is still a prisoner. Usopp, still in a bad way, is transported by the Tontattas, while his companions follow close behind. For his part, Kinemon sets off in search of his friend, but is spotted by a group of gladiators intent on taking his bounty. To escape, the samurai has no choice but to jump into a huge hole that connects with a dump below.\nAt the same time, Doflamingo\u0027s announcement electrifies the inhabitants of Dressrosa, who must submit to his wishes. However, some of them are reluctant to betray the former king Riku, who is one of the twelve wanted criminals, and feel it would be wiser to capture them rather than kill them.\nMeanwhile, at the east entrance to the House of Toys, Dellinger boasts that one of the wanted criminals is near him. He\u0027s thinking, of course, of Franky, who\u0027s knocked out. But the cyborg has disappeared under the noses of Machvise, Se\u00f1or Pink and Dellinger, who realize that all their soldiers guarding him have been knocked out. Franky, revitalized after a heavy dose of cola, sets out to destroy the Smiles Factory. Unfortunately, he is quickly spotted by a few locals who set off in pursuit of his bounty. Franky manages to stop them using his weapons, but other people, blinded by money, surround him to capture him. Caught in a trap, the cyborg must defend himself at the expense of the innocent victims who want to get their hands on him, before running off to fulfill his mission.\nAt the entrance to the factory, Diamante and Trebol, who are guarding the entrance, notice that the entire building has risen thanks to Pica\u0027s powers. They suddenly receive a snail-like call from Doflamingo, who orders them to return immediately to the Royal Palace. The two officers of the Doflamingo Family obey, while Robin and his friends make their way out of the Underground Port to the surface. Bartolomeo, still hot on the heels of their pursuers, takes charge of them, erecting an impenetrable barrier using his gifts. While still running, Robin receives a call from Zoro, who informs the young archaeologist that he and Luffy are on the King\u0027s Plateau. The Straw Hat suddenly takes the snail phone from his friend\u0027s hands to speak to Robin and ask if Rebecca is next to her. He tells her that the Lightning Fury Soldier is her father. Straw Hat comforts her as best he can, telling her to stay with her friends who will protect her no matter what, while solemnly promising to put an end to this cruel game and defeat Doflamingo once and for all...",

        "description": "The group led by Robin continues to make their way to the surface through the ruins of the Colosseum Corrida. On the way up, the young archaeologist asks Luffy who he\u0027s with. The Straw Hat replies that he\u0027s with Zoro and Trafalgar Law, as well as Viola and former king Riku Doldo III. At the mention of these names, Rebecca\u0027s heart fills with joy, as do the Dwarves accompanying her. Robin continues to follow Sabo, while Koala has turned back after receiving permission from her superior.\nOn the King\u0027s Plateau, Law explains to Luffy that he plans to destroy the Smiles Factory while leaving Doflamingo alive. If Doflamingo dies, Kaido\u0027s rage will fall upon them. But the Straw Hat is not having it all his own way, as he has noticed with his own eyes that the situation on Dressrosa has become worrying, and claims that if Doflamingo is not stopped, the island will continue to suffer.\nAt the same time, men-at-arms are scouring the streets of Dressrosa\u0027s capital city in search of the twelve fugitives, while Navy soldiers manage to subdue the madmen manipulated by Doflamingo\u0027s demonic powers. Not far away, Vice-Admiral Bastille has regrouped with the rest of his men to launch a counter-attack against the pirates. He is joined by Admiral Issho, who explains that no matter what Doflamingo has done, he has become untouchable and cannot be stopped.\nOn the King\u0027s Plateau, Viola, in the company of her father, takes charge of finding the key to Trafalgar Law\u0027s Sea Granite handcuffs, which had fallen off after Pica expelled them from the palace, while Luffy, without even asking his two companions\u0027 permission, takes Law and Zoro under his arms to jump into the void to find Doflamingo.\nIn the ruins of the Coliseum Corrida, the Marine soldiers on guard take fright when they see hundreds of people rising from the ground. Among them are soldiers, World Government officials and pirates rushing to escape from the underground port where they were imprisoned. While the freed Cavendish sets off in search of Luffy, Maynard reports to Bastille, who is astonished by his presence there. Bastille scolds him for taking part in the tournament and risking his own life. But Maynard admits to being aware of Doflamingo\u0027s misdeeds and advises his superior to take the pirate into custody.\nMeanwhile, in the underground Trading Port, where pirate ships are still moored, Koala boards one of them to search for weapons. She discovers weapons hidden in the ship\u0027s holds, which she inspects. She learns that the ship was originally from the Kingdom of Doerena, and that it had disguised itself as a pirate ship to better profit from the arms trade. Using a photographic snailophone to take pictures, the young woman is surprised by sailors who intend to set fire to their ship in order to erase all evidence. But Koala prevents this by taking them on one by one, using the Fishman Karate taught to her by Hack.\nOutside, Dressrosa is in total chaos. Fires are breaking out all over the capital, with the authorities unable to stop them. Maynard takes advantage of this moment to ask Issho why the Navy couldn\u0027t arrest Doflamingo, even knowing what he\u0027d done. Issho replies that the situation has become untenable since the World Government decided to rule everything its own way. This news took Maynard by surprise, leaving him speechless.\nAt the same time, Doflamingo\u0027s business seems to be moving forward. Doflamingo holds the only keys that can open the doors of the Smiles Factory, whose walls, made of Sea Granite, are indestructible. He destroys them in front of his entire crew. While watching Sugar, still unconscious, Lao G harshly judges Trebol for his incompetence. Trebol defends himself by confessing to his master that he couldn\u0027t understand how a man, tied hand and foot, had been able to stun Sugar. Diamante, for her part, provides the same kind of response, telling Doflamingo that he couldn\u0027t believe that the second-in-command of the Revolutionary Army could have taken part in the tournament and seized the Mera Mera no Mi. Their master forgives them, as it was all in the past, and prefers to concentrate on present events, telling his men that the Navy will not chase them, but that Fujitora will have to be eliminated anyway, as he intends to abolish the Shichibukai system altogether.\nIn the streets of Dressrosa\u0027s capital, Navy soldiers, having subdued a few of the madmen, set off in pursuit of the Straw Hats and Trafalgar Law to arrest them. They fail to notice the presence of Machvise, Se\u00f1or Pink and Dellinger, who remain unmolested by the police. As he sees the Marine troops running in all directions, Se\u00f1or Pink remembers Franky\u0027s last words and his intention to destroy the Smiles Factory. He wants to stop him at all costs, and decides with his acolytes to finish him off.\nFor his part, Franky has managed to lose the Navy agents and takes it upon himself to destroy the Smiles Factory as planned. Nearby, Luffy, Zoro and Law come across Machvise, Se\u00f1or Pink and Dellinger. Dellinger recognizes Law and tries to stop him. Luffy stops him but, as he tries to flee, Se\u00f1or Pink grabs him by the feet after rising from the ground with his power. Threatened with being crushed by Machvise\u0027s enormous weight, Luffy manages to extricate himself in extremis by stretching as far as he can. Unfortunately, he is threatened again by Dellinger, who is about to hit him. He is narrowly saved by Zoro, who deflects his adversary\u0027s attack and violently hits Machvise. The three fugitives are about to flee again when the citizens of Dressrosa, baited by the bounty promised on their heads, block their path. Luffy, Zoro and Law owe their lives to the unexpected appearance of Issho and his men, who intend to arrest the three pirates. The surprised pirates recognize him...",

        "description": "Luffy, Zoro and Trafalgar Law face Issho and his men. The Straw Hat asks Issho to let him pass, as he has a score to settle with Doflamingo, but the Navy Admiral refuses to obey him and blocks the way to the Royal Palace, where his enemy is. Luffy has no choice but to confront him using his Haki. But his attack is stopped by Issho\u0027s skill: even a blind man can fight a young pirate as impetuous as Luffy.\nAt the same time, at the Royal Palace, one of Doflamingo\u0027s soldiers warns him that Luffy and his companions are fighting against Fujitora and the Navy forces. This situation delights the master of Dressrosa, who doesn\u0027t want to intervene. However, Pica, with her delicate voice that takes Doflamingo\u0027s guards by surprise, disagrees with her boss and decides to take care of them personally to finish them off. But Doflamingo calms his ardor by explaining that the game he has set up will determine which family is the most worthy to rule Dressrosa: either the Riku Family or the Doflamingo Family. Pica, however, is determined to settle the matter himself, and his high-pitched voice makes one of the soldiers laugh, which immediately incurs the wrath of Doflamingo\u0027s lieutenant, who can\u0027t bear anyone making fun of his voice. But Baby 5 stops him by doing the dirty work herself. Metamorphosing her right leg into a machine gun, she kills the guard who had mocked Pica before the delighted eyes of Doflamingo and his acolytes. The other guards are frightened and terrified by the scene.\nAfter the body of the unfortunate guard is thrown out of the Royal Palace so that his family can bury his remains, Doflamingo reveals to his men that he lost his mother when he was 8 and murdered his father when he was 10. His men, who have received the rank of officers in his crew, form his family, and he warns anyone who comes into contact with him that he will not allow anyone to mock one of his family members with such impunity, at the risk of incurring his wrath.\nNot far away, in the ruins of the Coliseum Corrida, men-at-arms track down Usopp. Knowing he was worth five stars, they set out to kill him and pocket the reward promised on his head. Usopp, along with Robin, Rebecca, Hack, Bartolomeo and Leo\u0027s Dwarves, who are carrying him on their backs, try to outrun their pursuers. As she runs, Robin tells Rebecca of her plan: to access the King\u0027s Plateau via one of the Colosseum\u0027s outer walls to join the rest of her companions, who are already there.\nSeeing the number of their pursuers increasing, Hack stops running and decides to confront them, using Fishman Karate to give his friends more time to escape. His tactics work, but other men, baited by money, appear to pounce on Robin and Rebecca. The two young women owe their salvation to Bartolomeo who, thanks to a barrier of his own design, prevents them from being captured. Robin thanks her savior, who is deeply moved. Bartolomeo invites her to continue her race while he holds off their pursuers for as long as possible.\nAt the same time, Luffy stands up to Issho, who refuses to yield an inch to the young pirate. Using his powers, he pushes the Straw Hat back in front of Zoro, who can\u0027t accept this. Zoro immediately launches into the attack, confronting the Admiral with saber blows. But he\u0027s no match for Issho\u0027s fencing skills, and the Admiral counters all his parries. Machvise and Dellinger, witnesses to the scene, stand back from the fight in front of them before noticing the absence of Se\u00f1or Pink, who had set off in search of Franky. The latter arrives at the Smiles Factory with the aim of destroying it and freeing the Dwarf slaves still trapped inside.\nAt the same time, in the Coliseum Corrida, Robin and his group have reached the outer wall adjoining the Royal Palace. The Dwarves are distraught, as they won\u0027t be able to scale such a height on their own. The young archaeologist reassures them and, using her gifts, creates a giant mesh to scale the immense wall. Enthralled by this prodigy, Rebecca calls Hack and Bartolomeo to join them as soon as possible. The former competitor in the Colis\u00e9e Corrida tournament is delighted to have received the invitation, as he\u0027ll be able to see his idol Luffy again!\nMeanwhile, on the King\u0027s Plateau, Viola is in the company of former king Riku. She is actively searching for the key that will free Law from his Sea Granite handcuffs. She manages to find it using her abilities, but also to detect her niece, who is in a very bad way. Rebecca, who is at the foot of the rampart, is attacked by three armed men. She is saved in extremis by Tank, who immediately kneels before her and swears to serve her to the end. Riku, who has recognized his voice, calls out to him at the top of the wall. Tank is delighted to see the former ruler of Dressrosa again, as is Rebecca, who can\u0027t hide her joy at the sight of her beloved grandfather.\nA long way from this reunion, in the streets of the city, Kyros continues his race, still determined to bring the Riku Family back to power, while Kinemon finds himself at the bottom of a rubbish dump after his vertiginous fall. Around him, he notices men asking him if he\u0027s all right. The samurai thanks them for their concern before asking if they knew a man called Kanjuro. Suddenly, however, an immense rumbling is heard, shaking the whole island of Dressrosa and causing panic among the population. This incident puts an end to the duel between Zoro and Issho. The Swordsman of the Straw Hat Crew, the Navy soldiers, Trafalgar Law and Luffy witness the appearance of Pica, who has taken on the appearance of a giant stone Golem. He tells them that he intends to destroy all those who dare stand in the way of the Donquichote Family. Upon hearing these words, Luffy can\u0027t help but laugh at the giant\u0027s high-pitched voice, provoking his anger.\nExasperated by the Straw Hat\u0027s incessant laughter, Pica is about to unleash a tremendous punch, the mere sight of which sends his own companions, Machvise and Dellinger, and his soldiers fleeing, as they decide to make for the Royal Palace to avoid being killed. As he flees with Trafalgar Law, Luffy is stopped in his tracks by his friend\u0027s Sea Granite chain. They are about to be pulverized by Pica\u0027s punch, before the helpless eyes of Zoro, who can do nothing to stop the giant who is destroying everything in his path...",

All the inhabitants are frightened by the sight of the huge stone hand still embedded in the streets of their city. All fear a second outburst from the giant. For his part, Zoro is unharmed and manages to free himself from the rubble that was in his way with his sword. He immediately sets off in search of Luffy and Law. He soon finds them, suspended in mid-air, after realizing that the Straw Hat and his ally were unharmed by Pica\u0027s lightning attack. Law reprimands Luffy for daring to mock the giant\u0027s high-pitched voice. Such an act would be tantamount to dying at Pica\u0027s hands!\nWhile wondering where they are, Luffy and his friends come across Cavendish, who is determined to repay their debt to Usopp by beheading Doflamingo himself, which Luffy strongly objects to, as he wishes to deal with his enemy personally.\nNot far away, the soldiers of the current ruler of Dressrosa actively search for the lifeless body of the Straw Hat under Pica\u0027s undaunted gaze, but without the slightest success. They realize that he must have been ejected with the rest of his companions to another part of the city. However, the stone giant doesn\u0027t want to call off the search, as he hasn\u0027t forgotten the mockery Luffy inflicted on him in connection with his high-pitched voice.\nAt the same time, Luffy, carrying Law on his back, and Zoro are running together. They are stopped by men-at-arms who covet the bounty promised on their heads. Instead of fleeing, Luffy and Zoro attack them head-on and get rid of them easily. But more men appear, and the pirates, outnumbered, can\u0027t bring themselves to fight them all. Just as they are about to flee, a new group of men appears and Luffy recognizes Don Chinjao, Xai and Boo, with whom he had fought at the Coliseum Corrida tournament. But instead of attacking them, these three men want to offer their help to the Straw Hat and his friends.\nAfter confessing that he no longer holds a grudge against his family and that Usopp saved them, Don Chinjao and his grandsons are ready to help Luffy and his companions in their fight against Doflamingo. But the Straw Hat is not happy about this prospect, and still wants to take care of his enemy himself. Don Chinjao gets angry and is about to fight Luffy when Hajrudin, the powerful warrior from Elbaf, appears. After asking him to forget what happened at the Coliseum Corrida, Hajrudin also offers his help, along with King Elizabello II and his military advisor Dagama, to pay off his debt to King Riku. So do the bounty hunter duo Jeet and Abdullah, in memory of Usopp\u0027s help in freeing them from Sugar\u0027s yoke, and Orlombus, accompanied by Ideo, Suleyman and Blue Gilly. They all want Doflamingo\u0027s head, including Cavendish.\nLuffy tries to reason with them, but to no avail. However, the Straw Hat and his friends are soon found by men-at-arms who still want the rewards promised on their heads. They are prevented from doing so by the tournament\u0027s former participants. Luffy and Zoro take advantage of this moment to flee, but just as they are about to leave, the Straw Hat sees Ucy, the fighting bull who had helped him at the Colosseum, appear before him. The animal also recognized him. The young pirate has an idea that could work in his favor. Climbing onto Ucy\u0027s back with Zoro and Law still handcuffed, Luffy set off to attack Doflamingo\u0027s guards as they searched in vain for him in the rubble. The two members of the Straw Hat Crew are soon joined by former tournament participants, who lend a hand against Luffy\u0027s wishes. This situation once again fuels Pica\u0027s anger. He rises to his feet and prepares to strike again at the capital of Dressrosa, after announcing his intention to arrest them in a small voice. All the former champions of the Colis\u00e9e Corrida can\u0027t help but laugh at his high-pitched voice, which irritates Pica more and more. Pica is now ready to strike again. Don Chinjao and Elizabello II notice his gesture and together destroy his enormous destructive arm before the astonished eyes of Pica and his men. This heroic act cheers up all the men accompanying the Straw Hat, who still want to kill Doflamingo against Luffy\u0027s advice...",

However, the huge Golem is not so easily defeated. As he regenerates, he uses his remaining arm to rout the attackers who had noticed that Luffy was no longer with them on the battlefield. They see him, still riding Ucy, climbing up the immense Golem\u0027s other stone arm, but the latter eventually catches sight of him.\nAfter Pica has finished regenerating the stone arm shattered by Chinjao and Elizabello, he prepares to use it to smash the Straw Hat. But Luffy doesn\u0027t let up, smashing the giant\u0027s head with a Grizzly Magnum.\nMeanwhile, on a devastated street in the capital of Dressrosa, a naval soldier reports to Admiral Fujitora that former gladiators from the Coliseum Corrida are heading with Luffy for the Royal Palace, where Doflamingo is staying. This news does not surprise Issho, who immediately sends a snail-mail call to Vice-Admiral Bastille to inform him of the situation. Fujitora asks all his men scattered around the city by Pica to assemble at the foot of the Royal Palace to launch the counter-attack.\nFor his part, Kyros continues to advance through the city, ignoring the citizens of Dressrosa who want to award the promised bounty on his head. Suddenly, he sees innocent civilians being manipulated by the demonic power of Doflamingo. This vision brings back painful memories of the time when the head of the Doflamingo Family took over the island using the same ruse. Determined to restore Dressrosa\u0027s reputation, Kyros vows to overthrow Doflamingo in the name of King Riku.\nNot far away, on the King\u0027s Plateau, Robin and his friends continue to climb one of the outer walls of the Royal Palace next to the Coliseum Corrida. However, they are pursued by a group of armed men who want to seize the bounty promised for the capture of Rebecca, Robin and Usopp - a total of 700 million berries. But the archaeologist of the Straw Hat Crew doesn\u0027t want to let them get away with it, and forces his comrades to climb the wall faster, much to the delight of Bartolomeo, who lives this great moment alongside his idols. When everyone has managed to set foot on the Plateau, Robin magically makes the net they used to climb the immense wall disappear, and sees their pursuers fall into the void below her.\nAt the same time, the body of the gigantic decapitated Golem threatens to topple over the city, but it\u0027s strong enough for Luffy and his group, still on Ucy\u0027s back, to reach the Royal Palace safely. Suddenly, Zoro notices that Pica\u0027s body is empty! He has a hunch that their adversary is very close to them. His warrior\u0027s intuition is justified as Pica appears in person, without his stone armor, and threatens the insurgents with his great sword. However, Zoro steps in and, mocking his soprano voice, begins a duel to the death with Doflamingo\u0027s terrifying subordinate, while Luffy heads for the Royal Palace to settle Doflamingo\u0027s score once and for all...",

They take advantage of the situation to continue on their way to the Royal Palace in the hope of defeating Doflamingo once and for all. On the way, they sweep aside their adversary\u0027s guards with a wave of their hands, as various members of the Doflamingo family look on in admiration. Lao G informs his comrades that Navy soldiers, led by Admiral Fujitora, are gathering at the foot of the Royal Palace. The blind admiral is on the front line and knows that half his men are already there.\nFor his part, Baby 5 tells his colleagues that four groups have formed. First of all, the former participants in the Colis\u00e9e Corrida, who are on their way to the palace; then Kyros, the legendary champion of Dressrosa, who is motivated only by his desire for revenge; then Zoro, who is about to face Pica alone; and finally Luffy, riding his faithful Ucy with Law and the inseparable Jeet and Abdullah, who are on board. The latter face the wrath of the Straw Hat, who wants to personally settle the score with Doflamingo.\nBaby 5 suddenly notices Se\u00f1or Pink\u0027s absence. Machvise explains that their friend has gone in search of Franky in order to fight him. Indeed, the cyborg from the Straw Hat Crew is running breathlessly towards the Smiles Factory with the aim of destroying it. But his plan is blocked by Se\u00f1or Pink.\nAt the same time, Kyros emerges from his hiding place to face the armed men who are looking for him, not to pocket the bounty promised on his head, but to put an end to this terrible game set up by Doflamingo. But instead of surrendering, the former Colis\u00e9e Corrida champion flees and continues his vengeful struggle. For their part, the group led by Luffy continue their advance to the Royal Palace. Jeet and Abdullah are worried about Zoro, who has stayed behind to fight Pica. The Straw Hat reassures them that his friend won\u0027t lose. Indeed, Zoro fights fiercely against his adversary. The latter can do nothing against him, as all his attacks are countered by Zoro\u0027s fencing skills. Zoro continues to mock the high-pitched voice of his opponent, who tries everything in his power to kill him, without the slightest success.\nAs they make their way towards the Palais Royal, Law, who had been keeping to himself, reveals to Luffy that the real aim of his strategy was to kill Doflamingo and that, although he had been beaten in their first encounter, it would be different next time. He ends his confession by adding that the \u0022Young Master\u0022 had taken away his benefactor 13 years ago, Corazon, former commander-in-chief of the Donquichotte Family and Doflamingo\u0027s own brother!\nNot far away, Robin and his group have safely reached the King\u0027s Plateau. While Bartolomeo desperately searches for his idol Luffy, everyone takes a well-deserved rest. Leo is horrified to discover that the Royal Palace has been moved and is now in a place inaccessible to him and his companions. Suddenly, Viola brings them a glimmer of hope, telling them that she has managed to find the key to Trafalgar Law\u0027s Sea Granite handcuffs. Rebecca, for her part, is thrilled to see her aunt back in good health, as are the Dwarves of the Tontattas tribe, who are delighted to see their ally again. The latter explains to her father, former King Riku, that the Straw Hats are their last hope of restoring freedom to Dressrosa, and that neither the Navy nor the World Government can be counted on to bring peace to their country. This hope should come through the outright elimination of Doflamingo, who has caused the kingdom so much harm over the last ten years. Leo agrees with the princess and proves it by introducing the former king to Riku Ussop, who has become their hero after breaking Sugar\u0027s curse that has turned so many people into toys. And even though Luffy\u0027s companions are pirates, lawless beings, Leo assures Riku that they will always have their trust until the end.\nRebecca, who witnesses the scene, asks her aunt\u0027s permission to hand over the key to Luffy. Viola is astonished by this request and finally agrees, even though she knows that her niece is wanted all over the island. At the same time, Bartolomeo insists on accompanying the young gladiatrix on her venture, as he is desperate to see Luffy again. Leo and his companions are also on board, advising their allies to use the rooftops to get to the palace. Inhel, one of the dwarves, informs them that Fraland is fighting Se\u00f1or Pink at the entrance to the Smiles Factory. The Dwarves will take advantage of this fight to free Princess Mansherry and their comrades, who are still imprisoned in the building.\nMeanwhile, Luffy and his companions eventually reach the first level, where numerous soldiers are waiting to confront them. The latter fire at them, but their bullets are stopped by Straw Hat\u0027s elastic body, which sends them flying back. Thrilled by this victory, Luffy is more eager than ever to defeat Doflamingo once and for all...",

At the same time, Ideo and his friends climb the outer wall of the palace to reach the top, where some members of the Doflamingo family are standing. Dellinger, who witnesses the scene, takes fright, but his companions, Lao G, Machvise, Gladius and Baby 5, remain impassive. Suddenly, they hear from the guards on the first level that Luffy is already there, clearing a path to quickly reach Doflamingo\u0027s location, much to the delight of Jeet and Abdullah, who are still accompanying the Straw Hat on Ucy\u0027s back.\nNot far away, the Navy soldiers and Fujitora face Sabo, ready to do battle with them. Unafraid of fear, Luffy\u0027s brother uses his new gifts to defeat his opponents. The latter discover that this eminent member of the Revolutionary Army is invulnerable to their assaults, and that he is gifted with incredible strength, enabling him to break blades with his bare hands and easily bend the barrels of rifles!\nVice-Admiral Bastille sees that his men are in dire straits, and decides to fight Sabo by demonstrating his sword, the \u0022Shark Slicer\u0022. Unfortunately, he is no match for him and is quickly defeated. Just as Sabo is about to defeat his opponent, he sees Admiral Fujitora use his powers to conjure up a huge meteorite. The meteorite heads for Dressrosa, but is held back by the bars of Doflamingo\u0027s Birdcage, which cut it in two. The pieces break through the barrier and fall on the island, creating even more chaos. Issho tries to apologize for his blunder, while Sabo reveals that he is Luffy\u0027s brother, just as he was with Ace with the Burning Fists. At this news, the Navy troops lose their composure as Sabo explains to Fujitora that he will always be there to lend Luffy a hand when he asks.\nAfter this new revelation, Issho has no choice but to fight Sabo. As he is about to face his opponent, he reminisces about his childhood with Luffy and Ace as children. After recalling these tender memories, Sabo launches a lightning attack on Issho and tells him that Luffy is the brother he must save...",

Opposite them, Doflamingo\u0027s guards try to bring down the fighting bull on which the Straw Hat is standing, but the latter won\u0027t let them. Knocking at every opportunity, the young pirate managed to clear a path and eventually approached the mountain on top of which lies Doflamingo\u0027s new Royal Palace. On his way, he crosses paths with Cavendish, who is determined to eliminate Doflamingo personally. He is soon followed by Hajrudin, Ideo, Orlumbus, Blue Gilly and Xai, who also want to kill the master of Dressrosa. As for Luffy, he has to face Doflamingo\u0027s guards again, who try to shoot Ucy. Ucy easily dodges their shots, and the Straw Hat\u0027s companions attack their assailants.\nThey are soon supported by the Funk Brothers, who reveal that they have discovered a secret passage leading directly to the Field of Flowers in front of the Palace. As they follow their new ally, Trafalgar Law tells Luffy of his desire to be freed from his Sea Granite handcuffs, but his friend refuses to return to the King\u0027s Plateau to search for the key, preferring to continue on their way.\nLuffy and his group enter the tunnel after thanking Kelly Funk warmly, but in their haste, Jeet and Abdullah lose their balance and fall off Ucy. Now just the two of them on the fighting bull\u0027s back, Luffy and Law make rapid progress through the secret passage. As they make their way towards the Sunflower Field, Luffy receives a snail phone call from Robin, who informs him that Leo, Bartolomeo, Rebecca and herself will soon be joining him to give him the key to unlock Trafalgar Law\u0027s handcuffs.\nAs the savvy leader of the Tontattas\u0027 army, Leo knows how to transport Robin and his friends quickly to the Sunflower Fields while Kelly Funk, who wants to kill the Straw Hat, intends to set a trap for Luffy. At the same time, on the former royal plateau, Bartolomeo, Robin and Rebecca use an unorthodox method to get to the Sunflower Field by flying over the city\u0027s rooftops with the help of beetles kindly provided by Leo and Kabu.\nNot far away, in front of the Smile Factory, the dwarves led by Inhel join forces with Franky to open the building\u0027s doors, but the carpenter from the Straw Hat Crew has his work cut out with Se\u00f1or Pink still blocking his way. For his part, Zoro is still battling Pica, who is using his stone man powers against him.\nMeanwhile, at the entrance to the tunnel leading to the Sunflower Field, Kelly Funk and her men are assaulted by a mysterious force, while Luffy and Law realize that the shortcut provided by the Funk Brothers turns out to be a water-filled dead end, and that Doflamingo himself is coming up behind them...",

After realizing that the two pirates had once again joined forces to fight him, the ruler of Dressrosa uses his powers to shoot down Ucy and plunge Luffy and his friend into the vulnerable water. With them at his mercy, Doflamingo\u0027s ambush of Luffy and Law is short-lived. The King of Dressrosa is violently skewered by Abdullah and Jeet, who are stunned to discover that they were dealing with a common clone!\nAt the same time, Kyros continues his advance through the city streets. All around him is chaos. As he howls his hatred of Doflamingo once again, a pirate who covets his promised bounty on his head prepares to shoot the former Coliseum Corrida champion. But his shot is deflected by an old man who doesn\u0027t want Kyros killed. Exasperated, the man who wanted to kill Kyros points his gun at the old man and decides to shoot him. However, Kyros stops him and quickly overcomes his killer. The old man takes advantage of the situation to grab the gun and point it at Kyros in order to capture him. But the former captain of the royal guard cannot do this and explains to the old man that the people of Dressrosa are peaceful. After this incident, he takes leave of the old man and continues on his way.\nIn the tunnel, Luffy thanks Jeet and Abdullah for pulling him out of the water. His two saviors tell him that Kerry Funk, who had betrayed them, was himself betrayed in return by Doflamingo! Luffy decides to create his own shortcut to the Sunflower Field.\nAt the same time, Kyros arrives on level 1, where the Royal Palace used to be, and hears the voice of the Straw Hat, who is about to create his own shortcut. Meanwhile, on level 2, where the Palais Royal now stands, Dellinger notices that the former gladiators of the Coliseum Corrida are making mincemeat of any Doflamingo guards who dare oppose them. Lao G and his companions decide to take them on one by one.\nCavendish\u0027s horse, Farle, takes fright. He witnesses a prodigy: Luffy\u0027s enormous fist, soaked in fluid, pierces right through the ground where his master and his allies are standing. In fact, the Straw Hat has decided to use the Elephant Gun technique to cut his way through the open air. Don Chinjao and his friends are stunned by this maneuver, as is Kyros, who arrives at the tunnel. Taking advantage of the confusion on the King\u0027s Plateau, Luffy takes Trafalgar Law with him, leaving his faithful and ailing Ucy in the care of Jeet and Abdullah. Reaching the second level, Luffy and Law find themselves surrounded by Doflamingo\u0027s men, but this situation doesn\u0027t stop the young pirate. He\u0027s determined to reach the ruler of Dressrosa and put him out of his misery.\nMeanwhile, on the other side of town, the battle between Fujitora and Sabo continues to rage. The Admiral of the Navy and the second-in-command of the Revolutionary Army are of equal strength, despite the power of their respective Demon Fruits.\nNot far away, in front of the Smiles Factory, the dwarves led by Inhel call Franky to inform him that they have found a way to unlock the building\u0027s heavy door. The carpenter of the Straw Hat Crew is happy to hear this, but he has a lot on his plate with Se\u00f1or Pink. The latter attacks him once again, and the cyborg has no choice but to fight him off, while in town, residents spot Robin, Bartolomeo and Rebecca in the sky, being transported by the Tontatta tribe\u0027s squadron of beetles. They shoot the three escapees in the hope of pocketing the bounty promised on their heads. They are prevented from doing so by Bartolomeo, who has decided to pull down his pants and urinate on them as he had done during the Coliseum Corrida tournament. On seeing this, their assailants take fright and flee.\nAt the same time, on level 4, Bellamy reaches the top of the Royal Palace and crosses the immense Sunflower Field. He demands an answer from Doflamingo regarding the orders to assassinate him. Doflamingo, amused by throwing into the air one of the keys that opens the Sea Granite doors of the Smiles Factory, is interrupted by Trebol, who asks if he has recently sent one of his clones to the lower town. The master of Dressrosa replies that he has. Then, in the company of his senior officers, Diamante and Trebol, he recalls his first meeting with Trafalgar Law, when the latter was still a child, a child who wanted to join his crew and who was driven only by a destructive rage, wanting to wipe out men, women and children who dared to stand in his way because, as a native of Flevance, the White City, he no longer had anything to live for...",

He demands an answer from Doflamingo concerning Dellinger, who was ordered to kill him in the basement of the Coliseum Corrida. The King of Dressrosa laughs at him and explains that their goals are different: while Bellamy wants to become a full-fledged pirate, Doflamingo wants to destroy the world. Meanwhile, in front of the piles of rocks that have accumulated below the Palace, Luffy carries Law on his shoulder and makes his way up to the King\u0027s Plateau, while the main agents of the Don Quixote Family move to halt the advance of the Colosseum army: Dellinger defeats Suleyman by digging his horns into his torso, Gladius prevents Don Chinjao from climbing up by shattering the stones he uses for support with explosive charges, Machvise attacks Boo by crushing him with all his weight, Lao G takes down Orlombus despite his great age and Baby 5 confronts Dagama by machine-gunning him on sight.\nAt the same time, in the small town of Sevio, some inhabitants, manipulated by Doflamingo\u0027s power, go mad and try to murder their own families. But armed men are on hand to prevent the worst from happening, quickly overpowering the madmen.\nNot far away, on the King\u0027s Plateau, Usopp has fully recovered from his wounds and is once again alert. He supports Riku in the face of Doflamingo\u0027s attempts to create chaos among the people of Dressrosa, and assures him that Luffy will do everything in his power to prevent this. Suddenly, however, a group of citizens track down Usopp and King Riku. They decide to capture them alive and use them as bargaining chips to lure the other fugitives and put an end to Doflamingo\u0027s deadly game.\nMeanwhile, in the rubbish dump beneath the King\u0027s Plateau, Kinemon is desperately searching for his friend Kanjuro, oblivious to the people with him. The samurai suddenly hears a dull, inhuman growl that terrifies all his companions in misfortune, while at the Smiles Factory, the captured dwarves are going through hell. An overseer punishes them for the slightest misdeed, forcing them to produce more fruit and making them believe they are needed to heal Princess Mansherry, who is extremely ill. But the intervention of the Pink Bee Squadron, led by Bee Anne, changes all that. With the help of her winged friends, Inhel and Wicca, she delivers a message. She wants the captive dwarves to open the factory gates and revolt against their captors. The latter enthusiastically comply, after discovering that they had been fooled about Princess Manshelly\u0027s supposed illness.\nAt the same time, on level 2, the members of the Colosseum army are being decimated one by one by the various officers of the Doflamingo Family. It\u0027s at this point that Luffy arrives and continues to run towards the Royal Palace, still carrying his friend Law on his back. He is soon helped by Cavendish, who invites him to climb on his faithful horse Farle to get to the third level more quickly. The Straw Hat doesn\u0027t hesitate, and climbs onto the animal without even thanking his savior. As they ride towards the lair of their common enemy, they realize that Kyros is also present on the horse. He solemnly announces that he intends to kill Diamante, who is in the Royal Palace. He also asserts that he can\u0027t lose with his real body, and as they make their way to the palace, the gladiators form a barrage against Doflamingo\u0027s guards to clear the way for Luffy and his companions under Dagama\u0027s orders...",

Hajrudin also lends a hand, using his enormous club to send a few of Gladius\u0027 men to the other end of the island. When all danger has passed, Dagama orders Cavendish to take the Straw Hat to the Royal Palace on his horse. The Magnificent Pirate Captain carries out this order without a hint of bitterness. However, the opposing troops reorganize under the combined leadership of the various officers of the Doflamingo Family. This turn of events does not frighten Cavendish, who asks Farle to go ahead no matter what. Gladius tries to stop them, but is prevented by Xai, who gets into a fierce fight with him. At the same time, Ideo also joins in the fight, but he comes up against Lao G, who supports his colleague Gladius. For her part, Baby 5 is not idle.

But, just as happened to Suleyman, Elizabello bites the dust. Just as he is about to be finished off by Dellinger, Hajrudin comes to his rescue and scares off this dangerous adversary. Grumbling at having missed, the powerful Elbaf warrior becomes the unwilling target of Machvise, who crushes him with all his weight before Elizabello\u0027s helpless eyes.\nWhile their allies battle the guards to cover their escape, Luffy, Kyros, Law and Cavendish continue their advance to the Royal Palace. Doflamingo\u0027s guards try to stop them, but to no avail. For their part, Dagama and the former gladiators of the Colis\u00e9e Corrida join Cavendish\u0027s group to lend them a hand. But Dellinger doesn\u0027t want that to happen and runs towards Dagama to plant his horns in his chest. The attack is devastating, but the King of Prodence\u0027s military advisor escapes unscathed and orders Luffy and his friends to continue on their way to the top of the Royal Palace. Obeying his wish, the Straw Hat and his comrades make their way to Doflamingo\u0027s lair despite heavy fire from their opponents. Cavendish is forced to draw Durandal from its scabbard to cut a path through the ramparts, while Luffy uses his gifts to cut down their pursuers.\nFar from the hustle and bustle, in the rubbish dump below the Executive Tower, Kinemon is intrigued by bulging noises that terrify his companions in misfortune around him. Eager to get to the bottom of this, the samurai goes to the source of the mysterious noises and finds his friend Kanjuro hiding behind a wall. The two samurai have an emotional reunion. Kanjuro remembers the last time he saw Kinemon, when Momonosuke was kidnapped by Caesar Clown\u0027s henchmen and taken by force to Punk Hazard. His companion had set off in pursuit of his son, leaving him in Dressrosa in the hands of Doflamingo\u0027s men. After recalling these painful memories, Kanjuro decides to get out of the dump and begins to draw a sparrow on a wall of their prison with the huge brush he has on his back, before the incredulous eyes of his companions. Soon his drawing comes to life after the samurai uses his powers to amaze everyone. Riding this strange animal, Kanjuro invites Kinemon to join him in getting out of the dump. The former toys, mostly soldiers from King Riku\u0027s royal guard and a few civilians, ask them to leave with them. The samurai complies and helps them escape from their prison by climbing ladders he had drawn with his own hands.\nNot far away, on the outskirts of the Royal Palace, Cavendish and Luffy continue to confront Doflamingo\u0027s guards, who try at all costs to stop them by shooting at them. However, they are supported by the Colosseum army, led by Blue Gilly, who eliminate the last remaining resistance one by one. But the latter has to face Dellinger, who violently punches him in the throat before Luffy\u0027s astonished eyes. Luffy can\u0027t come to his aid, as he absolutely must reach the top of the Royal Palace to fight Doflamingo. Cavendish reminds Luffy of the importance of this crucial mission, remembering the Dressrosa ruler\u0027s speech before his terrible game began. His ally reveals that the Birdcage their enemy had created was a deception, as it prevents any information from leaving Dressrosa. Cavendish also explains that the revelation of the island\u0027s arms trade and the secret of the toys have condemned all Dressrosa\u0027s inhabitants to death! Thanks to this prison of wires, the island is isolated and cut off from the world. The only way to change this situation is to kill Doflamingo. As he spoke, Dellinger, having defeated Blue Gilly, challenged Ideo while Machvise crushed Boo and challenged Hajrudin to a duel, while Baby 5 challenged Xai. While continuing to ride, Cavendish confesses to Luffy that it will be he who slays Doflamingo. This admission angers the Straw Hat, but also Kyros and Law, who are also after the life of the current ruler of Dressrosa. As they bicker and bicker, the four fighters soon reach the third level, where through a thick fog they see huge, strange puppets blocking their way...",

        "description": "Luffy, Cavendish, Kyros and Law have to contend with grimacing nutcrackers blocking their way to the Royal Palace, where Doflamingo is staying. The latter begin to advance in their direction. Cavendish orders his horse, Farle, to run through them to escape. The animal obeys his master when suddenly one of the puppets falls face down. Believing himself to be dealing with huge, clumsy toys, the nutcracker rears his grinning head and quickly crawls towards Farle, who rears back in terror as he sees the terrifying metal monster approaching. The nutcracker lunges at Luffy to tear his head off, but the Straw Hat is faster than he is and manages to dodge his attack. Cavendish orders his companions to be vigilant, as he has noticed that other nutcrackers are beginning to stroll dangerously in their direction, as if intent on attacking them.\nNot far away, on the Stone Golem, Zoro and Pica continue to fight fiercely, and soon the Straw Hat Crew swordsman has the advantage over his opponent. The Pirate Hunter suddenly notices Bartolomeo, Robin and Rebecca flying through the air. Pica sees them too and tries to attack, but Zoro understands the extent of his power. He uses one of his most powerful attack techniques, which slices the huge Golem\u0027s massive body in two. Having done this, Zoro explains to Pica, offended at having been defeated, that he will be the man who will one day become the world\u0027s greatest swordsman, as Bartolomeo looks on with tears in his eyes.\nMeanwhile, in the Smiles factory, the oppressed dwarves revolt against their former jailers who are powerless to stop them, while one of them, Mouji, believes she has finally found Princess Mansherry. Unfortunately, she is not in the factory. Meanwhile, one of the guards warns Shuuin, the factory manager, that the dwarves have just revolted. Armed with a huge vacuum cleaner, Shuuin leaves her office to put down the rebellion. As she makes her way towards the insurgents, they inflict heavy casualties on the factory guards, who fire on them. The guards are outnumbered, and can do nothing against the agility and speed of their smaller opponents.\nAfter preventing the guards from calling for reinforcements by snail phone, the dwarves, led by their leader, attempt to unlock the Smiles factory\u0027s front door, while Mouji learns that Princess Mansherry was not ill. He immediately sets off in search of her, taking some twenty of his co-religionists with him in his suite. The dwarves, led by Mouji, overpower the guards and soon arrive in a room to which they are forbidden access and which bears the name of their princess. After breaking down the door, they sadly realize that Mansherry is not inside, and bitterly realize that they have been fooled.\nAt the same time, the other dwarves are about to open the doors of the Smiles factory. In front of them, Franky battles with Se\u00f1or Pink, who seems invulnerable. However, the cyborg manages to fool him into believing that an old woman needs him. For their part, the dwarves are still trying to open the factory gates when Shuuin arrives armed with her vacuum cleaner. She uses it to capture the dwarves who try to flee at the sight of her, but to no avail. One by one, Mouji\u0027s friends are sucked into Shuuin\u0027s immense machine, and she laughs with delight at seeing her enemies reduced to her mercy. Just when all seems lost, the doors suddenly open and the dwarves are relieved to see Franky enter the building and flash a big, mocking smile at the Smiles factory manager, who can\u0027t believe her eyes...",

        "description": "Far from her friends, who are looking for her everywhere, Princess Mansherry is locked up in a dungeon, crying her eyes out for someone to free her. At the same time, Franky has managed to open the doors of the Smiles Factory, much to the amazement of Shuuin, the factory manager, who was busy capturing the dwarves with her huge vacuum cleaner. The dwarves are thrilled to see the cyborg, who hadn\u0027t come alone. He was accompanied by other dwarves, who were delighted to find their captive friends. This tender reunion moves Franky, who also cries with joy. Bomba suddenly asks Mouji if he has found Mansherry. The latter, sheepishly, tells him that he had looked all over the factory for her, at the risk of being captured by the guards, but unfortunately the dwarf princess was nowhere to be found.\nAs Franky asks his friends who Princess Mansherry was, Shuuin, who hates being ignored, reminds them. She tries to catch dwarfs again with her vacuum cleaner, but Franky stops her. Having recognized the carpenter from the Straw Hat Crew, she asks him where Se\u00f1or Pink has been. Franky explains that he has managed to fool one of the most esteemed officers of the Doflamingo Family into believing that an old grandmother needs his help. Irritated by this deception, Shuuin tries to hit Franky with her vacuum cleaner, but the cyborg stops his gesture by taking the factory manager in his arms, much to the Dwarves\u0027 surprise.\nNot far away, on level 3, where the Palais Royal stands, Cavendish, Luffy and Kyros are stopped in their tracks by head-busting dolls. Seeing that the only way through is to defeat these grimacing lead soldiers, the three men step forward to confront them. The fight is not long in coming, as a nutcracker is already attacking them. The three fighters defend themselves and manage to defeat several of their opponents. But there are so many of them that they put up violent resistance.\nAt the same time, in the Smile Factory, Shuuin tries to break Franky\u0027s grip, but to no avail. For his part, Se\u00f1or Pink has realized the deception and retraces his steps back to the factory. Speeding towards the cyborg, who at the same time knocks the factory manager to the ground, Franky manages to knock the two members of the Don Quixote family into each other, causing them to faint at the same time, much to the astonishment of the dwarves. But Shuuin isn\u0027t completely knocked out, and gets up angrily with a large bump on his head. With the firm intention of making him pay for this affront, the factory manager wishes Franky dead. But Franky doesn\u0027t let her get away with it, and calms her down with a passionate kiss on the mouth. Under the effect of this kiss, Shuuin falls madly in love with Franky, who couldn\u0027t care less about her. For his part, Se\u00f1or Pink comes to and quietly addresses his opponent. The two men, equally hard-bitten, agree that this woman disgusts them to the core, before embarking on a third round just as violent as the previous ones.\nNot far away, on level 3, Luffy, Cavendish and Kyros have emerged victorious from their battle with the nutcrackers, but the latter have not said their last word. At the same time, in front of the Plateau, at the site of the Pica statue, Zoro continues his duel with the Stone Man. Frustrated at not having been able to stop Rebecca and her friends, Pica fiercely attacks Zoro to make him pay for his insolence. However, the swordsman of the Straw Hat Crew is an excellent fencer and dodges every blow from his increasingly enraged opponent. The latter uses his powers to eliminate his enemy, but Zoro is the stronger in this little game. For his part, Bartolomeo, who always accompanies Rebecca and Robin, is thrilled to be able to witness this battle of the titans and savors his pleasure at seeing the prowess of his idol, Zoro. Robin tries to bring him back to reality as they soon approach the second level. Suddenly, L\u00e9o, who is sitting on Rebecca\u0027s shoulder, receives a snail phone call from Mouji informing him that he had been unable to find Princess Mansherry in the factory. This news saddens the dwarf leader.\nAt the same time, on the outskirts of the former King\u0027s Plateau, a group of armed citizens of Dressrosa are determined to capture King Riku and Usopp and stop the cruel game being played by Doflamingo. Meanwhile, Viola informs her father that the Tontattas have contacted him to warn him that they have been unable to find Mansherry. Riku, who believes that the missing princess is in Doflamingo\u0027s lair, asks his daughter to use her abilities to locate her. Viola obeys, while Ussop witnesses Kinemon\u0027s return in the company of his friend Kanjuro. Kanjuro confesses to Ussop that he had unwillingly helped their pursuers, who are now climbing the wall with the help of ropes drawn by Kinemon\u0027s friend, in order to pocket the bounty promised for the capture of Ussop and former king Riku. The latter informs them that Doflamingo will not kill Mansherry because he needs his power too much. For her part, thanks to her Clairvoyance, Viola manages to locate the princess, who is locked in a dark dungeon at the back of the chapel. Crying her eyes out, the princess is desperate to return to Green Bit and pleads with Leo to come and save her...",

Below them, they see the former gladiators of the Coliseum Corrida fighting against the officers of the Doflamingo Family. During their flight, Robin informs his comrades that they must join Luffy and the others who are waiting for them. At the mention of the Straw Hat\u0027s name, Bartolomeo dreams of meeting him and cries with joy when Luffy tells him he\u0027s his friend. Rebecca quickly brings him back to reality, while Leo receives a snail phone call from Viola, who tells him that she has succeeded in finding Princess Mansherry and that she is a prisoner in the Royal Palace, in a room behind the chapel. This is no stranger to the Tontatta army chief, as it was the place where little Viola was locked up as a child. As he reminisces about the past, Leo remembers with emotion the pleasant times he spent with Viola when she was getting into mischief, and also with Rebecca\u0027s mother Scarlett, who used to bring them food on the sly. Now that they knew where to look, Robin and his friends set off to rescue the Dwarf princess.\nAt the same time, on the King\u0027s Plateau, where the Royal Palace stands on the third level, Luffy, Kyros and Cavendish have succeeded in defeating the Headcracker Dolls. Just when they thought they\u0027d defeated them all, one of them bites Farle\u0027s head off, shattering his skull. Luffy avenges Cavendish\u0027s horse by shooting his murderer, who rises to his feet as if nothing had happened. Cavendish and his companions realize that the Nutcracker soldiers they are facing are invincible, and keep getting up in front of them!\nFor his part, Usopp reprimands Kanjuro for his clumsiness. The samurai, at the height of his humiliation, tries to make amends, while Viola, who is with them, warns them that Sugar has woken up. This news panics the Straw Hat Crew sniper, who still remembers how he managed to make Sugar faint. King Riku\u0027s youngest daughter worries about Luffy and his friends, who are in grave danger because they know nothing of the power of this high-ranking officer of the Doflamingo Family. Although she has recovered, Sugar is still traumatized by her recent experience, and screams in terror as soon as she spots a long, pointed nose that reminds her of Usopp\u0027s. She takes revenge by transforming her body into a new one. She takes her revenge by turning her closest associates into Head-Breaker Dolls and sending them off to fight the Straw Hats, whom she blames for Doflamingo\u0027s setbacks. King Riku is extremely worried about this situation, fearing that the people and soldiers of Dressrosa will once again be turned into toys. Usopp himself harbors the same fear, having forgotten Robin\u0027s existence after she was shot by Sugar. Determined not to let this happen to Luffy, he grabs his black kabuto and decides to shoot Sugar from a distance. Viola helps him with her Clairvoyance.\nMeanwhile, Orlombus wreaks havoc on Doflamingo\u0027s guards, who are no match for his whip and Herculean strength. As for Xai, he has to face Baby 5, who proves to be a tough opponent. Not far away, Don Chinjao is forced to fight Lao G who, despite his advanced age, is determined to defend Doflamingo\u0027s interests. Their struggle frightens the guards, who flee in all directions to avoid being killed. Meanwhile, Gladius looks up and notices Robin, Rebecca and Bartolomeo. He decides to shoot them out of the sky as they fly over the third level. Gladius\u0027 first victim is Bartolomeo, and the force of the blast sends Robin tumbling to the ground. She asks Rebecca to reach the fourth level to give Trafalgar Law the key that will free him from his Sea Granite handcuffs.\nWhile his friends are in dire straits, Luffy continues to battle the Headache Dolls, using a highly effective fighting technique to defeat them. But this prowess is no match for the diabolical toys, who all come back to life! Now surrounded, the Straw Hat and his friends soon see no way out. Thinking their fate settled, they suddenly see one of the tin soldiers collapse under the weight of Bartolomeo, who has fallen from the sky! Robin joins him, using the \u0022Cien Fleur: Wing\u0022 technique, which enables him to fly through the air, using his power to grow a hundred arms on his back in the shape of two angel wings. After the reunion, the young archaeologist asks Luffy, Law and Kyros to go to the fourth level, where Rebecca is waiting for them with the keys to Law\u0027s handcuffs. But Gladius, who has fallen at the same time as Bartolomeo, interferes and orders the Headache Dolls to attack them. Despite this threat, Robin decides to stay and face her new enemies, while she orders the Straw Hat to go to the Field of Flowers so that Law can be freed from his chains...",

Once alone, the young woman takes advantage of this moment of respite to plunge back into her memories, recalling her youth with Soldier Lightning Fury. But suddenly she freezes in horror when she sees Diamante, none other than her mother\u0027s killer, advancing before her.\nFor his part, Luffy is attacked by Gladius, who sends him explosive cannonballs, but the projectiles are blocked by Bartolomeo, who creates a protective barrier. Annoyed, Gladius orders two Headcracker Dolls to get rid of this troublemaker, but the Straw Hat doesn\u0027t let him and eliminates these two dangerous threats. To make his idol look good, Bartolomeo comes up with the idea of using the barrier he\u0027s just created as a long staircase leading up to level 4. Luffy begins to climb it, with Trafalgar Law still handcuffed on his back, but the two pirates are attacked by a Headache Doll.\nNot far away, in the lower town, the battle between Sabo and Fujitora continues. The Navy Admiral creates a horizontal force of gravity that pushes Sabo back. The revolutionary wonders if Issho isn\u0027t hiding something important as he continues to fight him, causing immense carnage on the island.\nAt the same time, on the Field of Flowers, Rebecca is terrified by Diamante and, paralyzed by fear, is unable to flee. Her adversary takes advantage of the situation and wounds her with his big sword, while Luffy and Law are still battling with the Headache Dolls. They owe their salvation to Kyros who, after slicing through one of the huge dolls, is the first to climb the stairs. Luffy and Law follow close behind, while Cavendish protects their rear. Cavendish is determined to avenge his horse Farle, who has been mortally wounded by the infamous dolls. Gladius sees the Straw Hat running for the summit and attacks again. But Bartolomeo intervenes and blocks the bombs with his body, risking his own life because he can only use one barrier at a time and all his power is monopolized by the immense one he has just created. Robin thanks him for his gesture and takes over, fighting Gladius\u0027s puppets. While fighting, the young archaeologist informs Cavendish and Bartolomeo that Luffy is still the trump card that will lead them to victory. Meanwhile, the Straw Hat races breathlessly to level 4 to settle Doflamingo\u0027s score once and for all...",

        "description": "Thanks to the staircase created by Bartolomeo, Luffy, still carrying Law on his shoulder, races breathlessly up to the fourth level. He\u0027s determined to catch up with Kyros if he wants to get to the Flower Field first. He really wants to settle the score with Doflamingo and none other than himself. But as he climbs the stairs, Law warns Luffy of the Headache Dolls who are always out to get them. The Straw Hat manages to dodge their attack thanks to his agility. However, instead of continuing to fight them, Trafalgar Law advises his friend to get to the Field of Flowers as quickly as possible, where Rebecca is waiting. Rebecca has to contend with Diamante, who is proving to be an excellent fencer. Despite her long experience with weapons, the young gladiatrix is no match for such a fighter and suddenly loses the key that opens Law\u0027s Sea Granite handcuffs. She quickly finds it, but must face her mother\u0027s killer. Determined to exact her revenge, Rebecca defies Diamante, who has been waiting for this. But at the last second, she gives up and runs off, having retrieved the key to the handcuffs. Her adversary, who doesn\u0027t understand her attitude, pursues her and wounds her after transforming the blade of his sword into a long, sharp strip.\nNow at her mercy, Diamante is about to give her the coup de gr\u00e2ce when he pulls out a pistol, the same weapon that killed the young woman\u0027s mother Scarlett. As he takes aim at her, Rebecca cries out for help. She is saved by the swift intervention of Kyros, who stops Diamante\u0027s move by striking him with his sword. Disconcerted, he hears his adversary cry out angrily that he will not let him take away another member of his family. Rebecca, seeing that the person who had just saved her was missing a leg, deduces that Kyros and the Lightning Fury Soldier are the same person, i.e. not only her protector but also her father. He tells her that she no longer needs to fight. Diamante witnesses these words and, mad with rage, attacks Kyros, who confronts him without faltering. Rebecca watches helplessly as they duel, when she suddenly hears Luffy shout his name. She sees the Straw Hat, carrying Law, coming up the stairs and asks him to give her the key to her friend\u0027s handcuffs. Rebecca complies, but she sees the two pirates being attacked by a Headache Doll who wants to eliminate them. Luffy manages to retrieve the key and free Law\u0027s wrists just in time. Indeed, the Straw Hat and his friend had just been swallowed by the huge puppet before Rebecca\u0027s horrified eyes. Using his powers, Law manages to slice up their assailant, the pieces of which fall on the lower town.\nFor her part, Diamante notices the presence of Luffy and Law, increasing her anger at Kyros. Kyros asks his comrades to take care of Doflamingo for him. The Straw Hat and his ally accept his proposal. On their way to the Royal Palace, Luffy spots Rebecca. He thanks the young gladiator for helping them by handing over the key, and notices that Rebecca is very happy to have found her father at last. Still calling her \u0022Lucy\u0022, Luffy reveals his true identity and his ambition to one day become King of the Pirates. This exasperates Diamante, who wants to kill the two intruders with her own hands. But he is prevented from doing so by Kyros, who has a score to settle with him. This doesn\u0027t stop Diamante from attacking Luffy and Law. The latter saves his friend by teleporting them both inside the palace, much to Diamante\u0027s anger and Rebecca\u0027s relief, who sees her two friends going into battle against a terrible adversary who has oppressed her country for so many years.\nOnce in the Palace garden, Law himself extracts the three lead bullets that Doflamingo had fired at him at point-blank range, using his abilities, while Luffy is ready to settle the score with Doflamingo. The Shichibukai asks the Straw Hat to calm down or he\u0027ll never be able to defeat their opponent. A guard witnesses their conversation and warns Sugar, by snail phone, of the presence of these two intruders on the outskirts of the palace. Sugar takes it upon herself to stop them, as she has every intention of taking revenge on the Straw Hats, and in particular on Usopp for all the evil they had inflicted on her...",

        "description": "Hundreds of men climb the huge rampart of the Royal Palace on a long ladder designed by Kanjuro. They are determined to capture the fugitives with a price on their heads and deliver them to Doflamingo. Meanwhile, Kinemon\u0027s friend has completed a strange drawing of Usopp. Usopp puts the finishing touches to his plan to kill Sugar for good. Seeking Viola\u0027s help, he asks her to let him know every move their enemy makes, using her Clairvoyance.\nThe youngest daughter of former King Riku uses her Clairvoyance and sees Sugar leaving the Palace to turn Luffy and Law, who were in the courtyard, into toys. Knowing the importance of Usopp\u0027s project, Riku, Tank and Hack do everything in their power to buy him time by slowing down the advance of the Dressrosa citizens who have come to capture them, while doing them no harm. While Viola warns Usopp that Sugar is seeing his two friends, armed men invade the King\u0027s Plateau to stop the fugitives, who are fiercely resisted by Riku, Tank, Hack, Kanjuro and Kinemon.\nAt the same time, Sugar appears in the gardens of the Palais Royal, determined to take revenge for the affront perpetrated by the Straw Hats against her. Knowing that Luffy and Law are unaware of her true power, Sugar pretends to be a helpless little girl and tries to soften them up with her tears. As Usopp tries to target Sugar with his Kabuto Noir, citizens of Dressrosa attempt to break through the security cordon formed by the Straw Hat Crew sniper\u0027s companions to capture him. Outnumbered, Riku and his companions risk losing control at any moment, while Ussop continues to aim. While gathering valuable information from Viola, the sniper, sweating profusely, adjusts the accuracy of his shot as much as possible, while Sugar heads for Luffy and Law to give them her grapes. This is a serious moment. Thanks to Viola\u0027s powers, and Usopp\u0027s fluid, which enables him to sense the aura of his captain as well as those of Law and Sugar, the sniper manages to send his projectile just in time before men-at-arms catch him and tie him up like his other companions. His precise shot hits Sugar directly. When she realizes that the figure sent is Usopp\u0027s, she faints again.\nAs she regains consciousness, Sugar\u0027s curse magically disappears and the Puzzle Dolls attacking Robin, Cavendish and Bartolomeo fall to pieces one after the other. While the palace guards try to revive Sugar, Luffy takes advantage of the situation and takes Law with him to the top floor, where Trebol and Doflamingo await, both ready for the ultimate battle...",

The palace guards try to revive her, but to no avail. At the same time, Gladius finds himself up against Bartolomeo, Robin and Cavendish, who are determined to finish him off, but it\u0027s going to be a tough battle as they come up against one of the toughest officers in the Doflamingo family.\nMeanwhile, on the top floor of the Palais Royal, Luffy spots Bellamy lying unconscious on the floor. As the latter regains consciousness, Doflamingo is surprised by his adversary\u0027s attitude to worry about Bellamy\u0027s state of health, as he was once his enemy in Mock Town. The Straw Hat asserts that this is all in the past. The King of Dressrosa takes advantage of this moment to molest his former right-hand man, while disclosing to Luffy and Law Bellamy\u0027s plan to become one of his crew members. Angered, Luffy tries to hit Doflamingo, but his kick collides with Bellamy\u0027s bloodied face, which Doflamingo had used as a shield. Seeing the situation worsen, Trafalgar Law advises his ally not to get angry, as Doflamingo loves to provoke his enemies. Doflamingo tells them that their alliance had ruined all his plans at Punk Hazard, led to the deaths of Vergo and Mone, the kidnapping of Caesar Clown and the release of Dressrosa\u0027s toys from Sugar\u0027s curse. These misadventures bring back painful memories of 13 years ago, when Law spoiled his plans.\nAfter recalling his past fiascos, Doflamingo sends one of his clones to attack Law, who defends himself as best he can, while Luffy is forced to fight Bellamy, who has been manipulated by his former master. On the second level, the former gladiators of the Colis\u00e9e Corrida continue to fight against Doflamingo\u0027s guards. Don Chinjao has to contend with Lao G, who proves to be a tough opponent even if he has to wear glasses during the fight. For his part, Ideo has a run-in with Dellinger, who hits him with all his might with his feet. Not far away, Hajrudin battles Machvise, who despite his enormous weight, is faster than the giant from Elbaf. At the other end of the level, Sai takes on the beautiful Baby 5, a skilled fighter who uses all her powers to bring down her opponent.\nAt the same time, on level 3, Robin, Bartolomeo and Cavendish are making mincemeat of their opponents, but still have to contend with Gladius, while at the Smiles Factory, the battle between Franky and Se\u00f1or Pink continues to the cheers of their respective fans. The same fierce battle is being waged on the Flower Field, where Kyros duels fiercely with Diamante before Rebecca\u0027s terrified eyes, while Luffy and Law face off against their opponents. Seeing that the only way to finish off Doflamingo is to attack him head-on, Luffy rushes to Law\u0027s aid, who creates a bubble with his power that completely envelops the Doflamingo clone and switches places with the real Doflamingo. The Straw Hat takes advantage of this ruse to deliver a lightning blow to the ruler of Dressrosa in the stomach, leaving Trebol speechless. Law neutralizes him by cutting him to pieces with his sword, while Luffy hits Doflamingo with all his might, having learned from the Corsair Captain that they are both the worst pirates of their generation...",

For his part, Trebol worries about his fate but is held in check by Law, while Bellamy, who has been watching the whole scene, is blown away by the Straw Hat\u0027s performance. However, Doflamingo has not said his last word and is plotting his revenge. Drunk with anger, he creates a new clone that attacks Luffy. Luffy dodges and activates his Haki to prepare for battle. The Straw Hat\u0027s fight against the fake Doflamingo is fierce, but Luffy wants to fight the real one, who activates his clone like a common puppet.\nMeanwhile, on a street in the capital of Dressrosa, Sabo recalls Fujitora\u0027s words after his battle with the Admiral. He is quickly brought back to reality by Koala, who reprimands him by telling him that he shouldn\u0027t fight a naval officer so as not to draw attention to the Revolutionary Army. Not far away, on the King\u0027s Plateau, Usopp, King Riku and his friends are captured by the citizens of Dressrosa. Just when they thought they had everything under control, a group of pirates burst in to kill Usopp and pocket the bounty promised on his head. But the citizens of Dresrosa stop them, as they want to use their prisoners as hostages to stop Doflamingo\u0027s deadly game. Noticing that the pirates are refusing to cooperate and are beating up innocent people, Riku steps in and beats up the pirate leader. Riku calls for reinforcements, while the former ruler of Dressrosa cuts Hack and Tank loose to help him fight the pirates. Having defeated their opponents by binding them tightly, Riku finds that his former subjects are begging him to help them overthrow Doflamingo. The former ruler of Dressrosa advises them to trust Luffy, who is the only one capable of defeating Doflamingo. To everyone\u0027s surprise, Admiral Fujitora, who had joined them, also declares his confidence in the Straw Hat.\nMeanwhile, on top of the Royal Palace, Luffy battles Doflamingo and his clone using all his most powerful fighting techniques. Unfortunately, the Straw Hat is no match for them, while Law attacks Trebol. Seeing that this lawless pirate was attacking a member of his family, Doflamingo paralyzes him and inflicts small holes in Law\u0027s shoulder. For his part, Luffy tries to rescue his friend, but Doflamingo quickly subdues his new adversary by binding his hands with wires and manipulating Bellamy into hitting Luffy with his swords. Once this danger has been averted, the Shichibukai takes the opportunity to tell them about his childhood, when he was still a Celestial Dragon before his father gave up his Tenryuubito privileges to lead the simple life of a human being, a situation unbearable for the young Doflamingo who, at the age of ten, killed his father with his own hands! From that day on, Doflamingo had a fierce hatred for the whole world, and vowed to destroy it for all the evil the Celestial Dragons had inflicted on his family...",

Suffering cruelly from the absence of Admiral Fujitora, Vice-Admiral Maynard\u0027s men have to contend alone, with tranquilizer rounds, with furious animals rampaging through the streets, associated with citizens manipulated by Doflamingo, and pirates pillaging at every turn.\nAt the same time, at the top of the Royal Palace, Luffy, his hands tied behind his back, must fight both a Doflamingo clone and Bellamy, who is still controlled by the island\u0027s master, while Trafalgar Law questions the latter\u0027s ability to manipulate CP0 and the World Government. Doflamingo explains to his opponent that he knows the nature of a national treasure hidden on the Holy Land of Marie-Joie that the Celestial Dragons don\u0027t want to reveal to the whole world, and uses it to blackmail them while granting him their power. Doflamingo is thus aware of the full potential of the Surgeon\u0027s Fruit held by Law, as this very special Demon Fruit can grant eternal life in exchange for an operation, called the \u0022Surgery of Perpetual Youth\u0022, which sacrifices the life of its user. However, Law is not inclined to use his power on himself, and confesses that it is thanks to Corazon that he has the chance of one day defeating Doflamingo as he fights fiercely against him.\nAs he battles Doflamingo, Trafalgar Law recalls his past, when 16 years ago he discovered he had only three years to live. This short life expectancy had motivated his desire for destruction. A native of the White City, young Law, who was only 10 at the time, was one of the rookies who had recently joined Doflamingo\u0027s crew, which was stationed at Spider Miles, a port town in North Blue, under the command of Corazon, a clumsy but talented officer and Doflamingo\u0027s own brother. Law learned that his superior hated children and, one day, he was thrown out of a window in front of young Baby 5 and Buffalo. Law managed to get up from the fall, his face bloodied, and swore to kill Corazon, who had dared to mistreat him while the latter had caught fire after lighting a cigarette...",

        "description": "It\u0027s now been a week since 10-year-old Trafalgar Law joined the crew of Don Quixote Doflamingo, stationed in the North Blue port town of Spider Miles, and he\u0027s decided to stay, despite Corazon\u0027s constant abuse. During a banquet, his new companions discover that Law is the sole survivor of Flevance, a once prosperous country that no longer exists.\nAs the pirates in Doflamingo\u0027s pay continued their murderous raids on Rakesh, an island that had betrayed their trust by allying itself with groups other than them, Baby 5, who had accompanied them, asks Gladius to explain Law\u0027s origins in detail as they quietly strip corpses for their money. He revealed that their new companion had come from the \u0022White City\u0022. This place was so called because of a special lead, called \u0022Saturn\u0027s White\u0022 or ceruse, which was the source of wealth for all the island\u0027s inhabitants. But a century ago, the World Government discovered that this substance was toxic and decided to keep this information secret because of the immense wealth that Saturn White could bring.\nHiding the truth for decades, this extraordinary material began to wreak havoc on the population of the Kingdom of Flevance, causing shortened life spans and painful deaths. The neighboring kingdoms, fearing that the contagion would reach them, decided to quarantine Flevance by closing their borders with it. The country\u0027s royal rulers were the first to be evacuated, while ordinary citizens were mercilessly slaughtered by squads of soldiers sent to exterminate them, despite their efforts to resist. Law was at this time in the company of his younger sister Lamy and her parents. Law\u0027s father, who was a doctor like his wife, tried to find a cure for the disease that affected all his friends and his beloved, martyred daughter. But tragedy struck Trafalgar Law\u0027s parents when Navy soldiers, dressed in protective suits, invaded the hospital where they were working. The young boy saw that they had been murdered to prevent the spread of lead poisoning. But he was soon discovered by soldiers who tried to kill him by shooting him on sight. Law miraculously escaped his pursuers by hiding under a bridge. Alone and distraught, wandering among hundreds of corpses in the burning city, Law discovered that he was the sole survivor of Flevance.\nAfter Gladius has completed his tale, Baby 5 is shocked to learn of Trafalgar Law\u0027s painful story. She understands why the young boy, filled with anger, had a grudge against the whole world. In Spider Miles, who was not part of the punitive expedition to Rakesh, notices that Corazon, who was supposed to be watching him, was quietly reading a newspaper. Law takes advantage of the situation to attack him from behind, stabbing him through the heart. Unfortunately for him, Buffalo witnessed the scene and reported everything to Doflamingo, who had decreed a rule, \u0022the law of blood\u0022, according to which anyone who dared to touch a single hair on his brother\u0027s head would be impaled by his hand on the spot...",

All the inhabitants of the island where they had taken refuge wanted to pay for the Tenry\u00fbbito\u0027s crimes through them. Covered in sweat, the head of the Doflamingo Family wakes up with a start to the sound of a snail\u0027s buzzer, informing him of the assassination attempt on his brother Corazon.

However, Doflamingo declares that he will become an official member of his crew. He goes on to say that if Law himself finds a Demon Fruit capable of curing him of his illness, he will arrange for him to become his right-hand man in the very near future. Law then witnesses a scene in which Corazon lies to Doflamingo about his injury in order to protect him.\nThe next two years were devoted to Law\u0027s apprenticeship, as he accompanied Doflamingo\u0027s crew in all their acts of piracy in order to train himself. One day, Law revealed to Buffalo and Baby 5 his full name, \u0022Trafalgar D. Water Law\u0022, but he was soon taken to task by Corazon, who took him to a discreet location. There, safe from prying ears, he spoke to her for the first time, telling her that he, Law, was the one person who should never be around his brother...",

After these revelations, Corazon warns Law that Doflamingo is a monster and that if he continues to follow the same path as his brother, he too will become one. However, Law insists that he will soon die and rushes to tell Doflamingo everything. Corazon tries to stop him, but is surprised to see that Law has revealed nothing of his ruse, as Law explains that he owes him for what happened two years ago when he tried to stab his mentor.\nWhen his ship is attacked by a Navy vessel, Doflamingo is surprised to discover that Corazon has kidnapped Law in order to cure his illness, and that the two of them are sailing to every known hospital in the hope of finding a cure for the young boy.

Meanwhile, the wounded Trafalgar Law continues his duel with the real Doflamingo. During the battle, the privateer captain recalls his childhood days. He remembers that he and Corazon were contacted by snail phone by Doflamingo, who asked them to return to him after a six-month absence. He intended to steal the Ope Ope no Mi from under the noses of the World Government and the Navy and give it to his brother, unaware that the latter had already eaten a Demon Fruit. After hanging up, Corazon is overjoyed by this news and informs Law that the Ope Ope no Mi is the ultimate remedy for his young friend\u0027s ailment. Corazon also confesses that he intends to give this Demon Fruit to Law by stealing it before Doflamingo does, as the latter has the necessary medical knowledge to use it properly. In fact, Doflamingo suspects his own brother of being a traitor to his own family and working undercover for the Navy.\nCorazon then makes a snail phone call to Sengoku, who is in the company of Vice-Admiral Garp, informing him that his brother\u0027s crew is on Swallow Island, so that Navy soldiers can arrest them all. In exchange for this information, Corazon asks Sengoku to hand over the Ope Ope no Mi personally, at the risk of incurring the wrath of Doflamingo, the Navy and the World Government.

Finding Law unconscious, he takes him in his arms to escape as far as Ghost Town, the pirates\u0027 hideout, which is engulfed in flames. Once out of danger from their pursuers, Corazon gives Law the Ope Ope no Mi, forcing him to swallow it by force so that the young boy can be cured of the disease that is eating away at him. In doing so, Trafalgar Law becomes an unwilling user of Demon Fruit.\nSuddenly, Corazon collapses bleeding at his friend\u0027s feet. Law tries to heal him using his new powers, but to no avail. Before Corazon loses consciousness, he hands Law a letter he must give to a Navy officer, containing important information that could lead to the arrest of Don Quixote\u0027s crew, Doflamingo. But fate is once again against Law, for the first officer he meets on his way is none other than Vergo, his protector\u0027s sworn enemy. Begging him to save the dying Corazon, Vergo is guided by Law to his friend. Corazon catches sight of Vergo and is paralyzed with fear. Vergo bluntly punches Corazon in the face, ignoring his condition as Law looks on helplessly. Having reduced Law to impotence, Vergo beats Corazon to a pulp, risking his life by using the powers of his haki. For his part, Law can do nothing to save his friend, who is being martyred by this cruel man. Law begged him to stop, but he suffered the same fate even though he was still a child. When Law had finished his task, Doflamingo contacted him by snail phone to inform him that Corazon was a spy working for the Navy and that he was currently on Minion Island.

        "description": "Chaos reigns on Minion Island, and Navy soldiers have noticed that a huge cage has covered the entire island. Inside this impenetrable dome, the pirates trapped there are fighting each other as if driven by an all-powerful force. Doflamingo tracks down Diez Barrels and kills him to take back the Ope Ope no Mi. But he discovers that the Demon Fruit has disappeared. The head of the Don Quixote Family orders his crew to search the island and recover Diez Barrels\u0027 pirate treasure.\nWhile his men desperately search for Corazon, Doflamingo delves into his past and remembers the death of his father, whom he executed before the eyes of his brother, who begged him to stop. He then awakens from his torpor when he hears gunshots and when Pica tells him that they have found Rossinante\u0027s trail, who is now being hunted down like game. The latter, trying to lose his pursuers, manages to hide young Trafalgar Law in a chest full of treasures. But Doflamingo\u0027s younger brother is quickly captured by his former comrades, who intend to pay the price for his betrayal by inflicting the worst possible suffering on him. Suddenly, Doflamingo appears. Knowing he had nothing left to lose, Rossinante pulls a pistol on his brother and confesses that he is a Navy soldier whose mission was to infiltrate the Don Quixote family and stop them in their tracks. From his hiding place, Law overheard his friend\u0027s confession, who also told Doflamingo that he had made his young disciple eat the Ope Ope no Mi so that he would finally be cured of his illness.\nMad with rage, Doflamingo coldly kills his brother by shooting him several times with his pistol before leaving with the rest of his crew, taking all the Diez Barrels chests with them. While Don Quixote\u0027s crew Doflamingo loads the treasure onto the ship, Law emerges from his hiding place and runs as fast as he can away from his former companions. The sound of his footsteps and shouts are camouflaged by Corazon\u0027s power. But Corazon is about to die. Before breathing his last, he declares his love for Law. The death of his mentor plunges Law into a profound sadness that even his cries of pain cannot dispel...",

        "description": "In memory of Corazon, Law continues his battle against Doflamingo, who seems invulnerable to all his attacks. Meanwhile, the exhausted Luffy must contend with both Bellamy and a Doflamingo clone. Just as the Straw Hat wants to strike the latter, Bellamy steps in to attack him. Luffy has to stop fighting to avoid hurting his friend, who is being manipulated by the head of the Donquichotte Family. Above them, Law continues his duel with Doflamingo and tells him that Luffy is a D, and that it is perhaps by the will of fate that he has been sent here, because of Doflamingo\u0027s hatred of the Ds, the sworn enemies of the Gods. Law then reveals to Doflamingo that he\u0027s a D too. And so, angering and provoking him with this confession, Doflamingo loses his temper and causes extensive damage to the roof of the Royal Palace.\nNot far away, Viola, through her Clairvoyance, witnesses these events and tells her father, former King Riku, what she has seen. She tells him that there are three great battlefields spread across Dressrosa and that ten officers of the Donquichotte Family, including Doflamingo, are fighting against their allies. Thanks to her power, the young woman can see all the battles from wherever she is: Franky faces Se\u00f1or Pink in the Smiles Factory, while Zoro confronts Pica on the statue of the decapitated Golem. Meanwhile, Luffy continues his battle against the scythe Doflamingo, who takes great pleasure in using Bellamy as a human shield to prevent the Straw Hat from hitting him. At the same time, on the Field of Flowers, Kyros continues to fight Diamante under the helpless eyes of his daughter Rebecca. The latter shakes the ground, which ripples like a flag, so that his two adversaries can no longer stand.\nOn the lower level, Bartolomeo and Robin fight side by side against Doflamingo\u0027s soldiers, keeping them at bay with their respective powers. However, the young archaeologist is worried about Rebecca, and her companion, who has guessed her fears, lets her go up to Level 4 to help her friend, while he alone keeps Doflamingo\u0027s soldiers at bay. For his part, Cavendish stands up to Gladius and his troops. Meanwhile, on Level 2, Dellinger battles Ideo and dodges his attack, while Hajrudin tries in vain to crush the imposing Machvise. Not far away, Xai fights Baby 5, swearing he\u0027ll pierce his heart, while Don Chinjao battles with Lao G, who hits his opponent with a masterful kick, knocking him to the ground.\nMeanwhile, inside the Royal Palace, Leo and Kabu are on the trail of Princess Mansherry, eliminating all the guards blocking their way. Meanwhile, Zoro continues his sword duel with Pica, while Sabo, using the powers of Mera Mera no Mi, saves the lives of the people of Dressrosa, unaware that her friend Koala is looking for her. On the King\u0027s Plateau, Viola realizes that the fighting will soon be over. She tells her father that if Doflamingo is not defeated, they will all be trapped in the Birdcage forever. Their only hope of escape is to let all those pirates who have allied themselves against Doflamingo fight for them.\nFurious that Law is a D, Doflamingo rises to attack him. Trebol tells him that if he gets angry, he\u0027ll get into his opponent\u0027s game, but it\u0027s too late, Law uses an \u0022Injection Shot\u0022 on him, and drills him through the abdomen. After hitting him, Law tells him he\u0027ll do what Corazon couldn\u0027t do when he hesitated to shoot Doflamingo...",

The Straw Hat begs his friend to stop, but Bellamy just won\u0027t. All he wants now is to die. For his part, Zoro relentlessly pursues his battle against Pica, who devastates everything in his path without differentiating between his enemies and his allies.\nMeanwhile, Don Chinjao and Sai, both members of the Happou Fleet, are battling Lao G and Baby 5 respectively. Using attacks all named after the pains characteristic of the elderly, Lao G hits Don Chinjao, who almost falls over backwards. Baby 5, for her part, believes that Xai wants to marry her, but Don Chinjao, who had turned away from his fight against Lao G, is opposed to the union because Sai is to marry Uhorisia, the daughter of the Nihou Navy chief, as part of a marriage of interests to form the Juppou Navy.\nSuddenly, Lao G makes his spirit leave his body by pretending to die, but immediately recovers when he hears Baby 5 begging him not to leave. The young woman is still convinced that Xai needs her. The latter mockingly tells her: \u0022It\u0027s totally absurd, but so be it! Then die!\u0022. Baby 5, so happy to be of use to someone at last, uses her powers and turns her left forearm into a pistol, which she points directly at his temple. On the verge of death, Baby 5 recalls her past, when her mother abandoned her in the mountains because her family didn\u0027t want to feed an extra mouth and made her believe that useless people like her were not wanted by anyone!\nXai wants to stop Baby 5 from committing the irreparable, but Chinjao attacks the young woman with a headbutt capable of breaking a continent of ice in two!

Lao G, full of energy, takes advantage of this moment of inattention on the part of his opponent to shoot Don Chinjao. This odious act increases Xai\u0027s anger, and after confessing his decision to marry Baby 5 if he beats his opponent, he avenges his beloved grandfather by defeating Lao G using a new fighting technique, the \u0022Kiryu Kirikugi\u0022, while telling him to call him \u0022Don Xai\u0022 from now on...",

        "description": "Zoro has witnessed the defeat of Lao G and is ecstatic at the power of Xai, who has managed to defeat one of the toughest officers in the Doflamingo Family. The latter, in the company of Baby 5, who has become his bride, worries about his grandfather\u0027s state of health, while Baby 5, in love with him, is already ready for the wedding! However, the swordsman of the Straw Hat Crew still has to deal with Pica, who hasn\u0027t said his last word and continues to mock him with his high-pitched voice. The huge golem is still trying to crush him, but Zoro is too quick to fall victim to its attacks. Zoro continues his fierce battle against Pica when King Elizabello II arrives, an old friend of Riku\u0027s, the former ruler of Dressrosa. King Elizabello II offers to help him defeat the huge stone giant, but Zoro politely refuses, while Pica prepares to counterattack.\nOn the Field of Flowers, Kyros is still battling Diamante, who takes great pleasure in tormenting him by reminding him that he had failed to protect the woman he loved. These words infuriate the former captain of Dressrosa\u0027s royal guard, who attacks his adversary with determination. But Kyros can do nothing against Diamante\u0027s extraordinary powers, which have targeted Rebecca. Kyros saves his beloved daughter\u0027s life three times over, while Doflamingo\u0027s right-hand man is determined to see Rebecca die, just as he had done before with Scarlet, the girl\u0027s mother. Faced with this inextricable situation, the former toy soldier swears to atone for his wife\u0027s death and orders Rebecca never to wield a sword again, as he has now become strong enough to protect her.\nAt the same time, in the fire-ravaged lower town, Sabo saves the lives of many Dressrosa citizens when a gladiator asks him to free his comrades who are still trapped in the ruined Coliseum Corrida. Not far away, in the basement of the Royal Palace, Bellamy continues to attack Luffy using the powers of his Demon Fruit. Rushing from wall to wall, he wants to fight the Straw Hat, but the latter refuses to fight because he doesn\u0027t want to see his friend die. However, Bellamy, with tears in his eyes, begs him to face him to restore his lost honor. With Luffy still hesitating, Bellamy has no choice but to attack him, punching him directly in the stomach.\nAbove them, Doflamingo and Trebol attack Law, who has been in agony ever since the master of Dressrosa cut off his right arm. Disregarding his condition, they torture him to their heart\u0027s content, promising him a very slow death. But the former Shichibukai hasn\u0027t lost his determination and continues to taunt Doflamingo, who is annoyed by this spirit of revenge on the part of his former subordinate. Law, with all his energy, attacks him and uses his last remaining strength to bring him down. But Doflamingo is the stronger. Taking advantage of his superiority, Doflamingo promises Law that he will soon join Corazon in death. For his part, Luffy endures Bellamy\u0027s attack without faltering, and once again begs him to stop fighting him. But Doflamingo\u0027s former minion has his way and continues his duel with the Straw Hat, who can\u0027t bring him to his senses. As for Law, he is attacked by Trebol, who is astonished that his victim is still alive. He asks him to give up the game, while Doflamingo advises him to rest, as he doesn\u0027t want to see his enemy already dead.\nNot far away, on the third level, Cavendish and Bartolomeo continue their fight against Gladius and his men, but the two warriors are unable to get along with each other to the point of bickering to the delight of their enemies. Indeed, Bartolomeo, using his powers, has created an impenetrable barrier to protect Robin and the rest of his companions. Cavendish also wants to take advantage of the situation to save his own life, but the die-hard Luffy fan refuses to let him in just as Gladius blows up the floor with his gifts...",

Gladius thinks Cavendish has perished in the blast, but the pirate with the rose has managed to take cover behind Bartolomeo\u0027s protective barrier. The two allies can\u0027t help but bicker, to the point where Cavendish asks his acolyte to raise his shield and let him go to continue his fight against Gladius.\nSuddenly Bartolomeo spots Robin running to help Rebecca on the third level, but she is attacked by Gladius. She is saved in extremis by Bartolomeo, who protects her by extending an invisible barrier over her, which greatly irritates her adversary. Happy to have helped the pretty archaeologist from the Chapeau de Paille crew, who had winked at him in thanks for his services, Bartolomeo begins to mow down all the soldiers of the Donquichotte family, including Cavendish, who is in his camp. Cavendish, enraged, manages to rejoin Gladius, but they must both flee to avoid being crushed by the steamroller created by Bartolomeo, who has become uncontrollable.\nAt the same time, on the second level, Dellinger sees Gladius and Cavendish escaping, but he still has to deal with Ideo who, even if seriously wounded, wants to defeat this insufferable kid. However, the valiant fighter of the Long-Armed tribe is no match for Dellinger, who easily defeats him with his kicks while revealing his true nature: he is a descendant of the Fighting Fish!\nAfter defeating Ideo, Dellinger sets off in search of Gladius and reaches the third level. Before he can help him, the youngest member of the Donquichotte Family is beaten by Hakuba, Cavendish\u0027s diabolical alter ego, without his college having the time to stop him! Gladius, powerless, sees Dellinger collapse in front of him after suffering Hakuba\u0027s dazzling attack. Bartolomeo, well protected behind his barrier, witnesses the carnage and remembers the end of the Battle of Block D, where all the competitors had fainted except Rebecca. Suddenly, he notices that the dreaded attacker of the descendant of the Fighting Fish has now targeted him and realizes that it is Cavendish after recognizing his clothes. The latter, seeing that he could do nothing against Bartolomeo\u0027s barrier, sets his sights on Robin, who is running along the King\u0027s Plateau to join Rebecca.\nQuickly realizing the danger she was in, the young archaeologist immediately stops her assailant by immobilizing him with her powers, much to the relief of Bartolomeo, who thought the young woman\u0027s time had come. The latter, buoyed by her success, asks Cavendish, who has not yet become himself, what he expects of her...",

        "description": "As Robin joins Rebecca in the Field of Flowers, she is targeted by Hakuba. The young archaeologist easily stops her using her powers, before the astonished eyes of Bartolomeo, who witnesses the scene. He is so impressed that he idolizes Robin. For his part, Cavendish struggles to regain full control of his body, but Hakuba resists and orders Cavendish to go back to sleep.\nNot far away, Gladius, to prevent Robin from reaching the 4th level, blows up the wall on which the young archaeologist and Cavendish are standing. Bartolomeo tries to prevent his plan from being carried out, but is wounded in the leg by poisoned needles that turn out to be Gladius\u0027s hair. The latter suddenly begins to swell dangerously in front of his adversary and threatens to do the same to his two friends on the cliff. If Bartolomeo can\u0027t defeat Gladius, he won\u0027t be able to stop him from blowing up the wall where Robin and Cavendish are standing. However, he quickly finds the solution and sacrifices himself by enveloping himself and Gladius\u0027 swollen body in a huge spherical barrier. Stabbing his opponent, he causes the latter to explode. But the power of the blast is stopped by the barrier he has created, preventing Gladius from blowing up the wall on which Robin and Cavendish are standing.\nIn his attempt to stop Gladius, Bartolomeo receives thousands of poisoned needles that paralyze him completely, without releasing his pressure on Gladius, who is still imprisoned in the spherical barrier. But Gladius does not admit defeat. Even with a wounded shoulder and a bald head from all his poison needles, he\u0027s still capable of shattering the wall containing Bartolomeo\u0027s two friends. For his part, Cavendish has had to sacrifice half his body to Hakuba, and both beg Robin to release them in exchange for Hakuba using his speed to take the young archaeologist to the Field of Sunflowers where Rebecca is. Feeling bent, Robin accepts Hakuba and Cavendish\u0027s proposal just as Gladius blows up the cliff without Bartolomeo being able to stop him. The Doflamingo Family officer watches in amazement as his two prey escape before his very eyes.\nAs Cavendish and Robin reach the top of the King\u0027s Plateau, the pirate with the rose suddenly falls asleep and Robin again uses his powers to prevent them both from crashing to the ground. For his part, Bartolomeo blames himself for not having saved Robin and remembers the first time he saw Luffy in Loguetown, when the latter was about to be executed by Baggy on the very spot where Gol D. had died twenty years earlier. Roger had died twenty years earlier. Since that incident, Bartolomeo has developed a boundless passion for the Straw Hats, to the point of copying the fighting techniques of his idol, who had emerged victorious from the Coliseum Corrida arena, defeating one after the other of his opponents. Wanting to make himself worthy of the latter, Bartolomeo rises to his feet and, despite his wounds, finishes Gladius off with a punch imitating Luffy\u0027s \u0022Gomu Gomu no Pistol\u0022.\nOn the Sunflower Field, Diamante continues to wave the ground where Kyros and Rebecca are standing like a flag. He attacks Rebecca by waving the blade of his sword, but is prevented from doing so by Robin, who has decided to protect the young gladiator from him at all costs...",

        "description": "Using his powers, Robin takes on the task of protecting Rebecca instead of Kyros, as the former Coliseum Corrida champion prepares to unleash his wrath on Diamante, who is exasperated at seeing the Straw Hat archaeologist meddling in his affairs. At the same time, on the third level, Bartolomeo notices that two soldiers are carrying Gladius on a stretcher and lets them go after learning that his enemy will be unconscious for several days.\nOn their side, soldiers take Dellinger, who is in a bad way after his encounter with Hakuba, for treatment on the second floor of the Royal Palace, behind the chapel. There, they are greeted by Jora, who orders them to take good care of the Doflamingo Family executives. She suddenly learns from a guard that Gladius has also been defeated. She decides to carry out her plan, while Viola discovers, thanks to her Clairvoyance, where Princess Mansherry has been imprisoned. The youngest daughter of former King Riku then receives a snail call from the Smile Factory, where the fight between Se\u00f1or Pink and Franky continues to rage to the cheers of their respective fans. The dwarves there are worried about Mansherry. Viola rushes to reassure them by trying to contact Leo and Kabu, who are on the trail of the princess. She succeeds and informs the Tontatta army captain that Mansherry is being held by Jora and forced to use her power against her will. Knowing what would happen to their sovereign\u0027s daughter, the two dwarves climb the staircase to the chapel in a flash, beating off the soldiers guarding the entrance with ease.\nAs they make their way to rescue Mansherry, the latter, still captive, must face Jora, who orders her to use her ability to heal Machvise, Sugar, Dellinger and Lao G, who have been defeated. Unfortunately, the young princess is unable to do what she asks, as she cannot heal bad people against her will, and implores Leo to come to her aid. L\u00e9o is on his way, but Kabu has been hit and can no longer follow him. Now alone to deliver the princess, L\u00e9o defeats his enemies one by one to reach Mansherry. Mansherry is mistreated by Jora, who forces her to change her mind by torturing her into obeying him. Soon, a tear escapes from Mansherry\u0027s eyes and she stumbles upon a wounded guard. The latter is intensely healed. Jora then understands that the princess\u0027s power lies in her tears and tries to use them to bring her defeated companions back to life.\nHowever, Mansherry is not as docile as she would like and Jora has to use the hard way to get her to shed tears. Striking her on the fly, the young princess soon lets out a tear, much to the fear of Viola, who warns Leo to rescue Mansherry as quickly as possible. In view of the seriousness of the situation, the beautiful gypsy shares her concern with her father and her companions who are close by. Viola tells Usopp about Mansherry\u0027s power, which is a serious asset for their enemies. Indeed, using his gifts, they can heal defeated Doflamingo family members as many times as they like, making this a never-ending battle!\nEncouraged by the Tontattas, Usopp, Kinemon and Kanjuro, Leo manages to quickly find the place where Mansherry was imprisoned and continues to be mistreated by Jora. But the princess lets out several strings of tears, much to Jora\u0027s delight. Just as the healing tears were about to reach the Doflamingo Family\u0027s defeated cadres, Kabu suddenly appears and jostles Machvise, Sugar, Dellinger and Lao G before they are healed by the tears crashing to the ground. Leo takes advantage of his friend\u0027s maneuver to violently attack Jora and uses the full power of his Demon Fruit to defeat his adversary, sewing her and all her companions together and saving King Gancho\u0027s daughter, who is delighted to be reunited with her family at last, while confessing her love for Leo. Viola witnesses the victory of the captain of the Tontata army and reports it to her friends, who are pleased by this amazing outcome, while at the Royal Palace, Bellamy continues to violently attack Luffy to make him fight him. But the Straw Hat refuses the confrontation, worrying instead about the disastrous state of health of his opponent, who couldn\u0027t care less. Indeed, Bellamy wants to beat Luffy so that Doflamingo will have something to remember him by, which infuriates the Straw Hat...",

        "description": "Despite the rain of stinging iron bullets raining down on him, Kyros fiercely attacks Diamante, who defends herself as best she can under the eyes of Rebecca and Robin, who are still sheltered under the plant umbrella created by the young archaeologist. Determined to avenge his wife\u0027s death, the former Coliseum Corrida champion fights like hell, ignoring the multiple wounds inflicted by the rain of iron pounding his body. Keenly aware of the pain, Kyros continues to fight Diamante, who, despite her fencing skills combined with the powers of her Demon Fruit, soon finds herself in a very bad position.\nAt the same time, on the former King\u0027s Plateau, Viola uses her Clairvoyance to witness the intense battle taking place on the Flower Field and warns her companions that Rebecca is all right, while feeling Kyros\u0027s pain and anger as he fights like a lion. For her part, Diamante is impatient not to see her adversary already dead and continues to fight Kyros, who soon reaches the limit of his strength. The senior officer of the Doflamingo family takes advantage of this moment to deliver the coup de gr\u00e2ce to his opponent. The scene is observed by Viola, who describes everything she sees to her father and friends. After his daughter hears the name of her missing sister, Riku recalls with emotion the moment when he learned of Diamante\u0027s murder of Scarlett. Diamante had bragged to Viola about his deed, when the young girl was working for Don Quixote Doflamingo at the Palais Royal and wanted to take revenge on her sister\u0027s murderer.\nJust as Diamante was about to deliver the coup de gr\u00e2ce to her adversary, Kyros rose to his feet and attacked his wife\u0027s murderer with even more vengeance. The rain of stinging iron bullets had finished falling and, despite his wounds, the legendary hero of the Colis\u00e9e Corrida used the \u0022Trueno Bastardo\u0022, one of his most powerful fighting techniques, to defeat Diamante, who collapsed on Scarlett\u0027s grave in the middle of the Field of Flowers. Exhausted, the former Colis\u00e9e Corrida champion catches his breath. He is soon joined by Rebecca, while Robin, with a smile on her face, falls to the ground, losing a lot of blood after being wounded in the back during the shower of stinging iron bullets!\nWorried about her father\u0027s state of health, which requires urgent attention, Rebecca meditates beside him on her mother\u0027s grave, while Viola, thanks to her powers, learns of Kyros\u0027s victory over Diamante and shares the news with her companions gathered on the former King\u0027s Plateau. However, Viola warns her companions that the game is not yet won, as the four remaining members of the Doflamingo Family - Bellamy, Pica, Trebol and the current ruler of Dressrosa, the infamous Don Quixote Doflamingo - still have to be defeated. For his part, Riku, whose life is no longer in danger, decides to protect the citizens of his kingdom from this threat, while Ussop, deep in conversation with Kinemon and Kanjuro, notices Issho\u0027s disappearance. Issho has gone down to the lower town to find out whether the Navy soldiers have succeeded in restoring order by subduing the out-of-control citizens. When he learns that all was in order, Admiral Fujitora orders his men to gather all civilians in one place and set up a defensive perimeter around them to protect them.\nMeanwhile, Zoro continues his duel with Pica, who is proving to be a tough opponent. Suddenly, the latter abandons the fight to attack Kyros and Rebecca in the Flower Field before Robin\u0027s helpless eyes. Pica sees Diamante\u0027s defeat and laughs at him, while Kyros rises to his feet and once again draws his sword from its scabbard to face an enemy even more powerful than the one he had just defeated, while protecting his beloved daughter, who is frightened by the impressive stone Golem...",

        "description": "In the Palais Royal, Bellamy continues to leap from wall to wall, risking his own life to provoke Luffy. Luffy keeps trying to talk sense into his friend, but to no avail. However, Bellamy doesn\u0027t care about his recommendations and hits the Straw Hat hard. He takes the blows without flinching.\nOutside the palace, on the Field of Flowers, Kyros and Rebecca are threatened by Pica, who has appeared in front of them. Pica asks the former Colis\u00e9e Corrida champion what Riku means to him. Kyros replies that the former king of Dressrosa, who is also his father-in-law, was an irreproachable sovereign who was loved by his subjects before the arrival of Doflamingo, who brought discord to the island. People, even the poor, lived happily under his reign, and it\u0027s to recapture this past happiness that Kyros fights to free Dressrosa from tyranny and return the kingdom to its rightful owner, King Riku. Pica understands the situation and disappears before the stunned eyes of Kyros and Rebecca, who can\u0027t understand why their adversary refuses to confront them. The situation also puzzles Robin.\nThe young archaeologist, who has been following the whole scene, notes with horror that Pica is making her way to the 3rd floor to attack the surviving gladiators of the Colosseum Corrida. Zoro, who has not digested his opponent\u0027s abandonment, follows him to bring him down. Meanwhile, Pica reaches the third level and discovers the betrayal of Baby 5, who has fallen madly in love with Xai. The stone giant decides to punish her by crushing her. But the young woman\u0027s life is saved by Don Chinjao\u0027s grandson, who has pushed his future wife aside to prevent her being killed, but finds himself a prisoner. Don Chinjao tries to help Xai, but is attacked by Pica. Mad with anger, Xai breaks free from his stone prison and decides to fight the Doflamingo Family\u0027s top officer.\nJust as Xai is about to confront him, Zoro, exasperated by Pica\u0027s cowardly attack on the defenseless wounded, intervenes and decides to take up his duel with the Stone Golem where he left off, even if it costs him his own life. Suddenly, Pica revives his former stone body, which the Straw Hat Crew swordsman had decapitated, and uses it to terrorize the people of Dressrosa, as well as the Navy soldiers who can do nothing to stop him. Pica, seizing his advantage, decrees that this kingdom is the exclusive property of Don Quixote Doflamingo, who is the sole and worthy king of Dressrosa.\nWith these words, the colossal statue of Pica moves towards the King\u0027s Plateau to take Riku\u0027s life and then defeat all the enemies on the Plateau, including Usopp and the two samurai from the Land of Wa. For his part, Zoro follows him at a distance, determined to stop him at all costs. Pica provokes panic among the island\u0027s population, who run for cover to avoid being crushed by the imposing stone statue. Marine forces try to stop her by firing cannonballs at her, but the projectiles ricochet off her immense torso. Pica continues to advance towards the Plateau, watched by Kyros, Rebecca, Robin and Bartolomeo, who wants to fight Pica.\nFar behind him, Zoro has all the trouble in the world to catch up with his adversary and devises various plans of attack to put him out of action. His first plan was to make a long-distance cut with his swords, but he quickly abandoned this idea as he noticed that the distance was too great and that his sword strike would lose too much power. The second option open to him was to jump and climb above Pica, but again, this plan was doomed to failure as he couldn\u0027t move through the air over such a long distance. The third idea that crossed his mind was to shout to warn Usopp and the others of the danger threatening them, but his voice wasn\u0027t loud enough for his friend to hear it too. Zoro came up with a fourth plan, which involved calling Usopp with a snail phone and ordering him to leave the Old King\u0027s Plateau as soon as possible. But this too would not work, as he had no communication device. Zoro is left with a fifth and final plan, while Pica prepares to strike the Plateau with his huge stone fist. The pirate hunter rushes to implement it with the help of Elizabello II, who reserves himself for his King Punch, Orombus, Xai, Baby 5 and Don Chinjao, planning to fly through the air and cut the immense Golem\u0027s stone body to pieces before defeating Pica once and for all, whose body made of blood and flesh lies inside the immense stone structure. Implementing his latest plan, Zoro is about to launch his final assault on Pica...",

Meanwhile, Navy soldiers try to stop Pica by firing cannons at him. But this only serves to increase the stone giant\u0027s anger, and he routs his tiny attackers. Riku, fed up with the carnage, orders Pica to stop. In doing so, the former ruler of Dressrosa exposes himself to danger. Knowing he was risking his own life, Riku asks Tank to evacuate everyone from the former King\u0027s Plateau, as he has a score to settle with Pica. Ordering his companions to flee, he stays put. This attitude surprises his former subjects, who decide to stay with him. For his part, Zoro is about to put his plan into action.\nMeanwhile, Pica stretches out his huge stone arm to crush Riku, but has to stop when he notices the citizens of Dressrosa lending a helping hand to their former king by gathering around him. This slight setback doesn\u0027t thwart his plan, and Pica resumes his momentum to annihilate all his enemies. Usopp could only let out a long scream of horror as he saw the enormous hand of stone descend upon him. Suddenly, when all was lost, Orlumbus uses all his power to launch Zoro into the air. The Swordsman of the Straw Hat Crew is propelled through the sky at lightning speed, quickly reaching his target. Using the Weapon Fluid to coat the blades of his sabers to render them unbreakable, Zoro experiments with a new fighting technique that involves cutting the stone body of the immense Golem into pieces in order to extract Pica from inside, before the stunned eyes of all Dressrosa\u0027s inhabitants. When Zoro finally managed to pull his enemy out of his stone gangue, the latter covered his entire body in Haki to prevent the fencer from cutting him. Relying on the power of his own Fluid, the latter remembers his first encounter with Mihawk and vows to surpass him to become the world\u0027s greatest swordsman. Wishing to honor this promise, Zoro manages to strike down his dangerous adversary, but heaps of stone threaten to fall on those still on the plateau. That\u0027s when Elizabello II comes to their rescue, using his King Punch to pulverize what\u0027s left of Pica\u0027s former body to prevent any innocent people from being hurt by the rubble falling from the sky...",

        "description": "After Pica\u0027s defeat, Zoro recalls episodes from his training with Mihawk on the island of Kuraigana, who advised him to coat his sword blades with Fluid to prevent them from breaking. Realizing that his weapons had nothing, he hears Usopp\u0027s cries for him to come urgently to the King\u0027s Plateau. The swordsman of the Chapeau de Paille crew is quick to respond, and easily climbs the huge rampart separating him from his friend. At the same time, in the lower town, near the rubble of the ancient stone giant, naval soldiers gather around Issho to thank him for saving them. Indeed, after Elizaberro II had launched his famous King Punch, the pieces of the immense golem had been pulverized and had narrowly avoided the former King\u0027s Plateau, but were now threatening the inhabitants of the lower town. Admiral Fujitora intervened and, using his telekinetic powers, managed to levitate the huge debris above the city so that civilians and soldiers could evacuate to a safer place without anyone being hurt.\nThe news of Pica\u0027s defeat spreads rapidly throughout Dressrosa, and Xai is astonished that Zoro didn\u0027t take part in the Coliseum Corrida tournament, where he would surely have won without the slightest difficulty. Suddenly, a terrible explosion is heard. It comes from the Smiles Factory, which the Dwarves had managed to blow up by destroying all the SAD stocks in a huge brewery that consumes the entire interior of the enormous building. From the top of the Royal Palace, Trebol witnesses the scene but is not the least bit worried. He\u0027s convinced that Mansherry is still at their service and that she can revive all the Doflamingo Family\u0027s defeated officers. For her part, the Dwarf princess, transported by her faithful Leo and escorted by Kabu, arrives at the Flower Field and meets Kyros, Rebecca and Robin, who are very surprised by this visit. When the leader of the Tontatta army approaches Kyros, he can\u0027t help but draw a comparison with the enormous statue of the legendary hero at the Colosseum Corrida, which resembles him exactly. But Leo is delighted to see his commander-in-chief back in human form. Suddenly Mansherry sees that Kyros is seriously injured and rushes to treat him using his powers. But Rebecca\u0027s father refuses to let the Dwarf princess use her gifts, and asks her to heal all the islanders who are more in need of care than he is.\nAstonished by this decision, Princess Mansherry sees the extent of the disaster ravaging Dressrosa and understands the situation. At the insistence of Kyros, who believes that the island\u0027s destiny lies in the hands of valiant, justice-loving pirates, Leo, Kabu, Mansherry, Robin, Rebecca and himself cast their eyes in the direction of the Royal Palace, where the final battle between Luffy and Law and the infamous Doflamingo is being played out.\nAt the same time, inside the Palais Royal, as an unknown enemy neutralizes the guards, Koala tries to contact Sabo by snail phone to ask for his help, but the latter is too busy helping prisoners escape from the ruins of the Colis\u00e9e Corrida. But when his friend tells him that Luffy could be hurt, the Revolutionary Army\u0027s No.2 changes his mind and decides to join her.\nAt the same time, Zoro arrives at the top of the old King\u0027s Plateau to the applause of the people of Dressrosa, who thank him for having brought down such a fierce enemy. As for Ussop, he can\u0027t help weeping with joy at seeing his friend safe and sound. But Zoro quickly brings them to their senses, pointing out that the Birdcage encircling the island had not yet fallen. This meant that Doflamingo still had to be defeated for joy to return to Dressrosa. Riku and his daughter Viola agreed with him, and kept a close eye on the Royal Palace, where the battle between Bellamy and Luffy was not yet over.\nThe former captain of the New Age Crew continues to give the Straw Hat a hard time, still believing that his friend had been fooled by the master of Dressrosa and was going to die for nothing. Seeing that Luffy stubbornly refused to fight, Bellamy decided to kill him. Launching himself at him at full speed, he was struck down by a violent punch impregnated with Fluid that pinned him to the spot. Exhausted, Luffy gets to his feet after reluctantly defeating his friend and shouts Doflamingo\u0027s name, determined to make him pay the ultimate price. Doflamingo hears him and, in the company of Trebol, waits with bated breath beside Law\u0027s lifeless body...",

        "description": "On the King\u0027s Plateau, Viola announces to everyone that Luffy has defeated Bellamy and that only two formidable foes remain, namely Trebol and Doflamingo, and coldly tells them that they have just lost one of their own. This was Trafalgar Law, whose lifeless body lay on the ground under Doflamingo\u0027s lustful gaze, eager to see how Luffy would react to the loss of such a dear ally.\nA few minutes before this incident, Doflamingo was in the Royal Palace with Trebol, fighting against Trafalgar Law, already in bad shape after the loss of his arm. The fight was unequal and soon the former disciple of Corazon found himself at the mercy of his two attackers. Before giving him the final blow, Doflamingo asks his victim to practice his immortality technique on him, so that the master of Dressrosa can enjoy eternal youth in exchange for granting him any wish. Law accepts his proposal and asks Doflamingo to bring Corazon back to life. Trebol and Doflamingo are astonished by this wish. Law takes advantage of this moment to mock the ruler of Dressrosa, telling him that he can never defeat the Straw Hat Crew and take back Caesar Clown, who is their prisoner. These remarks provoke Doflamingo\u0027s anger, and he shoots Law repeatedly at point-blank range until his magazine is empty.\nBack to the present: Viola has told her companions of Trafalgar Law\u0027s death, and all remain silent in the face of this terrible news. After listening to his daughter, Riku decides to descend into the lower town to save as many people as possible from certain death, and is soon followed by many citizens, all too happy to serve their former sovereign once again. Meanwhile, Doflamingo watches Law bleed to death and struggles to calm his anger. Trebol manages to cheer him up, and Doflamingo relishes the idea of soon getting the Ope Ope no Mi back. As he prepares to reduce the perimeter of the \u0022Birdcage\u0022 enveloping the island, Luffy appears, determined to settle the score. Doflamingo looks at him and tells him he\u0027s too late to save his friend, having learned that Luffy has defeated Bellamy, who refused to flee. Mad with rage, the Straw Hat uses his \u0022Elephant Gun\u0022 to hit his enemy, but the latter stops his attack by using his powers. Undaunted, Luffy begins a duel to the death with Doflamingo, using his most powerful fighting techniques. Suddenly, he notices Law lying bleeding on the ground. He tries to revive him, but to no avail. He realizes that his friend is dead, a situation that satisfies Doflamingo, who continues to taunt the Straw Hat. Exasperated by his taunts, the Straw Hat counterattacks, even using Bellamy\u0027s technique to strike down Doflamingo and Trebol. But the master of Dressrosa stops his attacks again with a wave of his hand.\nFor his part, Riku arrives at the foot of the Old King\u0027s Plateau and watches carefully as his companions join him. Along with the navy soldiers and panicked citizens, he suddenly noticed the \u0022Birdcage\u0022 enveloping Dressrosa beginning to shrink dangerously, destroying everything in its path. Just as everything was about to be over, Law, whom everyone thought dead, regains consciousness to confide his last words to Luffy...",

Navy soldiers are powerless to stop the carnage. Meanwhile, in the Royal Palace, Doflamingo taunts Luffy\u0027s inability to save everyone and says his diabolical trap will kill everyone on the island in an hour. For their part, the Navy forces try to help the weakest escape from the danger zones to the city center. Panic even grips Usopp, who has taken refuge on the King\u0027s Plateau with Zoro, Kinemon, Kanjuro and Viola, as well as the rest of the island.\nSeeing that the only way to stop this infernal machine is to kill Doflamingo, Luffy rushes in to strike him, and another fierce battle ensues. As the Straw Hat desperately rushes into battle, his attack is anticipated by Law, who everyone thought was dead. Stunned by such a turn of events, Doflamingo and Trebol are too slow to react, and Law\u0027s attack tears the internal organs of the ruler of Dressrosa. The Straw Hat\u0027s former ally reveals that he had prepared a huge operating room around the palace using his power, and that it was thanks to this that he managed to escape the bullets that Doflamingo had fired at him by swapping his body with another nearby.\nIn the meantime, Doflamingo was now at the mercy of Trafalgar Law and Luffy, who was beating the crap out of him. Just as Luffy is about to give him the final blow, Law tells his friend to stop, dragging himself along the ground, and takes advantage of the situation, after reminiscing about his past, to tell him that Doflamingo should have died instead of Corazon...",

But he is stopped in his tracks by Luffy, who wants his friend to avenge the memory of his former master. The latter hadn\u0027t forgotten that Corazon had been murdered by his own brother while trying to stop him. Doflamingo, who knew how to strike a chord with his opponent, criticized his dead brother, calling him incompetent and right to have eliminated him. This was too much for Law, who launched a final attack that electrified Doflamingo\u0027s entire body, inflicting great pain.\nHaving delivered this final blow before Trebol\u0027s helpless eyes, Trafalgar Law collapsed from exhaustion at his enemy\u0027s feet. Luffy runs to him, begging him not to die and to stay with him. But, to their great misfortune, Doflamingo survives his attack by using his powers to repair his punctured organs with ropes. Luffy tries to intervene, but is overpowered by Trebol, who traps him with his mucus and sends him to the other end of the Palais Royal terrace. Once the Chapeau de Paille was out of harm\u0027s way, the head of the Doflamingo Family rose above his unfortunate adversary and aimed at Law\u0027s head to strike him with his right foot, but his gesture was stopped in extremis by Luffy, who hadn\u0027t said his last word. Luffy then gave his enemy a look full of hatred, letting him know that a merciless battle was about to begin between them.\nLuffy and Doflamingo fight each other using the Haki of Kings, but the power of the two adversaries, perceptible throughout Dressrosa, is equal. Trebol follows their confrontation with his eyes, remembering with nostalgia how he and Vergo had encouraged young Doflamingo to become King of the Pirates and to eliminate all those who would dare oppose him, after learning how the young boy had escaped popular vindictiveness by using the Haki of Kings for the first time in his life. As a token of his appreciation, Trebol gave him a pistol and a rather special Demon Fruit that would give him power and might: the Ito Ito no Mi. As for the pistol, Doflamingo used it to kill his father, who had stripped him and his brother Rosinante of their Celestial Dragon dignity.\nThe fact that Doflamingo is the King appointed by the heavens fills Luffy with anger, and he fights his opponent with all his might. The power of his attacks is so great that soon the Straw Hat has the upper hand over Doflamingo. But Doflamingo regains the upper hand, relying on his demonic charisma to temporarily knock Luffy down...",

Knowing that Luffy could no longer move, Trebol invites his boss to settle Trafalgar Law\u0027s account once and for all. Doflamingo doesn\u0027t hesitate, and heads for his unfortunate adversary to deliver the final blow. Luffy was not happy about the situation, and struggled like hell to get out of Trebol\u0027s grasp. Seeing that he had no chance of getting away, Law provoked Trebol by calling him papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9. This insulting remark sets him off. Offended, Trebol pushes Dofflamingo aside and threatens to kill Law, unaware that he was playing into his enemy\u0027s hands.\nTaking advantage of this moment, Trebol recalls the time when young Doflamingo had used the Haki of Kings to make all his family\u0027s enemies faint. With this act, Trebol, Pica, Diamante and Vergo designated him as the chosen one of the gods, and they immediately rallied to his cause. After Doflamingo had taken the head of his murdered father back to Marie-Joie, he returned to his new family, who welcomed him with open arms and designated him their rightful leader. After this episode, the Doflamingo family\u0027s influence grew, to the detriment of other organizations that overshadowed them. Eliminating them one by one, Doflamingo and his men acquired an unprecedented aura that threatened the future of the world while causing chaos and desolation wherever they went. As time went by, the Doflamingo family commanded respect, and no one dared contradict them on pain of losing their lives. Trebol, who knew his leader\u0027s powers, constantly reminded him to behave like a king, and that one day he would become the new King of the Pirates.\nBack to the present: Law is at the mercy of Trebol, who threatens to set fire to his flammable mucus. Knowing he had nothing left to lose, Trafalgar Law confesses to Trebol that Doflamingo couldn\u0027t care less about his deputies - they\u0027re nothing to him, not even members of his own family, but mere puppets. This new remark increases Trebol\u0027s anger and, despite Doflamingo\u0027s warning, he finds himself trapped by Law. As he threatens to kill him with his stick, despite Luffy\u0027s protests that he is still trapped in his mucus, Law uses his powers to attack Trebol, using his arm that Doflamingo had cut off. With disconcerting ease, Trafalgar Law\u0027s sword slices through Trebol\u0027s torso, causing him to scream in terror. These screams are heard throughout Dressrosa, including in the Field of Flowers, where Kyros and his companions remain.\nMeanwhile, the dwarves who had freed their brothers from the Smile Factory are worried about the turn of events. For his part, Franky invites his friends to stray from the confines of the \u0022Birdcage\u0022, which threatens to slice them to pieces if they don\u0027t leave. At the same time, Luffy manages to extricate himself from Trebol\u0027s mucus and notices that Law\u0027s sword stroke had removed all the mucus covering his opponent\u0027s body. Exposed, he looks sad to see, but he hasn\u0027t said his last word. Lighting a lighter above Law, Trebol set fire to the mucus still on his body, causing a huge explosion that engulfed the Royal Palace and shook the rest of the island.\nUsing her Clairvoyance, Viola informs her friends that Trebol has just been defeated and discovers that Luffy and Doflamingo had managed to escape the explosion at the Palais Royal. Law\u0027s life is also saved, as he was carried away from the deadly blast by the Straw Hat. The latter entrusts his ailing friend to Robin, who had caught him using her gifts and noticed that Law\u0027s right arm had been severed. As she tries to come to his aid, Doflamingo approaches her, informing her that his enemy is still alive and that he is about to deliver the coup de gr\u00e2ce. Luffy tries to intervene, but he\u0027s not quick enough to stop Doflamingo\u0027s projectiles, which threaten to injure Robin and Law...",

Suddenly, he is called by Cavendish, who asks him to use his power to create stairs so that Robin and his friends can escape from the plateau.

The latter flee at full speed towards the town center, abandoning their homes which are destroyed by Doflamingo\u0027s diabolical trap. Doflamingo is ready for the final confrontation.

Knowing he could never bend him with words, Doflamingo attacks Luffy first. A fierce battle in the Palais Royal begins. Against all the odds, Doflamingo proves to be a tough opponent, and all Luffy\u0027s fighting techniques are no match for him. Their duel is so fierce that it cracks the ramparts of the Royal Palace, which collapses before Robin\u0027s horrified eyes. For his part, Cavendish carries Law in his arms as he flees the set, but the Shichibukai asks him to leave him behind. Cavendish doesn\u0027t understand Trafalgar Law\u0027s attitude. Trafalgar Law explains that he had to wait almost 13 years for his revenge, and now the fate of Dressrosa rests entirely on Luffy\u0027s shoulders. He hopes his friend will emerge victorious from his battle with Doflamingo, and it\u0027s for this reason that he asks Cavendish to leave him there. He wants to witness the Straw Hat\u0027s triumph.\nThe battle between Luffy and Doflamingo is intense. The two pirates are of equal strength, and neither knows who will triumph over the other. Not far away, Trafalgar Law continues to plead with Cavendish to leave him behind. Knowing he\u0027d never be able to change his mind, Cavendish complied, inviting Robin to go ahead while he stayed with Law throughout Luffy\u0027s fight. At the bottom of the plateau, Bartolomeo creates stairs with his gifts and asks Robin to join him as soon as possible. But Robin is reluctant to abandon her companions. She finally leaves after Cavendish covers her shoulders with his coat. The young woman is about to descend the stairs to join Rebecca and Kyros, who are already downstairs, when she stops in front of Kabu, Leo and Mansherry, who don\u0027t want to leave Law to his fate if he\u0027s injured. Robin accepts their decision.\nMeanwhile, on the former King\u0027s Plateau, Zoro and his companions contemplate the progress of the \u0022Birdcage\u0022, which threatens to destroy everything on Dressrosa. This situation greatly displeases Usopp, who can\u0027t help but panic. For his part, Zoro decides to act and asks his friends to follow him. Kanjuro thinks that the Straw Hat Crew swordsman has an ulterior motive and invites Kinemon to accompany him. At the same time, Luffy continues his duel with Doflamingo with just as much zeal. Using Gear Second and Gear Third in succession to defeat his adversary, Luffy fails to bring him down. Worse still, the Straw Hat dropped his guard and Doflamingo took advantage to knock him down. Now at his mercy, the King of Dressrosa predicts that within the hour his \u0022Birdcage\u0022 will be completely sealed off, condemning all the island\u0027s inhabitants to certain death. Doflamingo also takes advantage of this moment to enumerate all the havoc his diabolical trap could well cause. For his part, Luffy has not lost his pride. He gets angry and, while promising to rid Dressrosa of such a monster, ends up activating the Gear Fourth...",

At the same time, on the King\u0027s Plateau, on the former site of the Royal Palace, the former participants in the Colis\u00e9e Corrida and Baby 5 watch helplessly as the terrifying spectacle unfolds. However, Xai doesn\u0027t want to stand idly by and decides to take matters into his own hands, asking his companions to revive their fallen comrades who had fallen fighting the various officers of the Doflamingo Family. This attitude makes his grandfather proud, as well as his future wife\u0027s boundless admiration. Meanwhile, Viola and Hack descend from the King\u0027s Plateau via the ladder Kanjuro had designed. The young woman is anxious to find her father, who is already down below. Fishman carries Usopp on his shoulders, as the latter is in no condition to stand. Suddenly, Viola notices that the center of the \u0022Birdcage\u0022 is moving (not a good sign).\nAt the same time, in the lower town, as the inhabitants flee at full speed, Zoro remains unperturbed despite the chaotic situation around him and reveals, with Kanjuro and Kinemon accompanying him, that he intends to take a shortcut through the \u0022Birdcage\u0022 which still encircles the island. Meanwhile, Cavendish remains at the bedside of Trafalgar Law, who lies in the Field of Sunflowers. He still wishes to witness Luffy\u0027s triumph over Doflamingo. While awaiting the final assault, the pirate with the rose is pleasantly surprised to discover that there are dwarves on Dressrosa, and that their princess possesses extraordinary healing powers. Indeed, after Leo has mended Law\u0027s torn arm, Mansherry rushes in to administer first aid, dulling the pain with her power. Cavendish recalls his time in the Underground Port, where he had noticed a large quantity of weapons amassed, and realizes that even if they beat Doflamingo, the war would not be over just yet.\nNot far away, at the top of the Royal Palace, Luffy activated the Gear Fourth, swelling his entire body before continuing his duel with Doflamingo. Doflamingo, initially impressed by this new fighting technique, is quickly overwhelmed by his opponent, who sends him violently out of the Palace and into the lower town, to the astonishment of all the inhabitants. Viola and her companions also witness this prodigy. However, the Shichibukai has not said his last word. He begins an aerial duel, attacking Luffy once again, but is unable to dodge the Straw Hat\u0027s lightning punches as he uses the full power of his Gear Fourth to strike down his foe...",

In the ruins of the Royal Palace, Jesus Burgess, captain of Blackbeard\u0027s first fleet, admires the spectacle, unaware that he is being spied on by Koala, who has been watching his every move since the end of the tournament.\nAt the same time, in the ruins of the Coliseum Corrida, Viola receives a snail phone call from her father, who informs her that Doflamingo has not yet been defeated. He tells her that when this latest threat disappears, so will the \u0022Birdcage\u0022 that encircles their island. Meanwhile, Zoro wanders the city streets, seemingly lost. He is caught by the two samurai from the Land of Wa, who have joined him by flying on the back of the bird drawn by Kanjuro. He and Kinemon invite him to come with them to quickly reach Franky\u0027s whereabouts.\nAs the three of them fly over Dressrosa\u0027s capital, the Birdcage continues to shrink, threatening the lives of its inhabitants. At the same time, Franky arrives in sight of the Smiles Factory and orders the Tontattas still trapped inside to leave immediately. The dwarves are astonished to see that the factory has not been sliced up like the other buildings. The cyborg understands the situation and explains that the walls of the Smile Factory are made of Sea Granite, a material invulnerable to Doflamingo\u0027s powers. Suddenly, Zoro joins Franky, who informs him that he intends to stop the wires to buy time for Luffy to emerge victorious from his battle with the island\u0027s master.\nDowntown, the duel between the Straw Hat and Doflamingo is far from over. The latter, having recovered from Luffy\u0027s powerful attack, changes his plan by switching his Demon Fruit to awakening mode! This action turns Dressrosa\u0027s buildings into wires, much to Luffy\u0027s astonishment.

Suddenly, Luffy is trapped, but his rage at Doflamingo is unstoppable and he frees himself from his bonds with ease. But the current ruler of Dressrosa has not said his last word. Preventing his adversary from approaching him, he launches new attacks with the Ito Ito no Mi with the aim of tiring out Luffy by turning the whole town into sons.

The head of the Doflamingo Family spots Luffy in the lower town, a shadow of his former self after the effects of the Gear Fourth have worn off. He smiles at the sight before placing his hand on his belly to use his power to heal his internal organs, which have been badly damaged by the Straw Hat\u0027s latest attack. The latter is desperately trying to regain his original form, but his strength is failing him.\nAs the island\u0027s entire population flees, Luffy is left to die a certain death. Then Gats appears, who had previously tried to capture the Straw Hat with the help of former gladiators from the Coliseum Corrida. He promises to protect him. The Straw Hat thanks him for his concern and declares that he needs only ten minutes to recover his Haki and reactivate the Gear Fourth to definitively slaughter Doflamingo in a single blow. Gats accepts his decision on condition that Luffy succeeds in removing the \u0022Birdcage\u0022 that still threatens to destroy Dressrosa. He promises to do so. Roused by this news, Gats puts Luffy on his shoulders to take him to safety with half the gladiators he had with him, while the other half takes charge of holding Doflamingo for as long as it takes for the young pirate to recover all his strength.\nAs the Coliseum Corrida gladiators attack Doflamingo, Jesus Burgess emerges from the shadows, dagger in hand, and pounces on Luffy with the aim of killing him and taking over his Gomu Gomu no Mi! But Sabo steps in and saves Luffy from certain death with a powerful kick that sends Burgess tumbling to the ground. After Sabo has managed to take down Jesus Burgess, he reveals his true identity to Gats and the former Colis\u00e9e Corrida competitors, declaring that Luffy is under his protection as his little brother. At the same time, he explains his relationship with Luffy and Ace. He also explains that Ace\u0027s death was the path he had chosen, and that he had no desire for revenge. The only thing he wants to do now is cover Luffy\u0027s back. He then shows him that he owns the Mera Mera no Mi, a detail that infuriates Burgess. Sabo asks Gats to take Luffy to safety, explaining that he was the rightful heir to Ace\u0027s powers and that no one else but him could get hold of the Mera Mera no Mi.\nAs Gats and the other gladiators continue on their way, carrying Luffy with them, Jesus Burgess violently attacks Sabo to steal his power, but the latter seems invulnerable thanks to his Demon Fruit. The second-in-command of the Revolutionary Army uses his gifts to fight his adversary so that he can no longer take Luffy\u0027s life. The latter, still carried on Gats\u0027 shoulders, explains that it was Sabo who had replaced him during the finals at the Colis\u00e9e Corrida and won the tournament prize in his place. Although this is against the rules, Gats is delighted to learn that Sabo has managed to recover his missing brother\u0027s power. Suddenly, the official commentator of the Coliseum Corrida sees the army of gladiators he had sent against Doflamingo being decimated by the latter in the distance. The survivors are no match for the Shichibukai, who demands Luffy\u0027s head to finish him off once and for all...",

Behind him, Kanjuro and Kinemon observe the scene. The Swordsman of the Straw Hat Crew calls for their help, as he will not be able to stop the \u0022Birdcage\u0022 on his own. After a brief moment\u0027s hesitation, the two samurai lend Zoro a hand, imitating him by enveloping their weapons in Fluid, as do Franky and the Tontattas, who join forces by moving the Smile Factory, whose walls are made of Sea Granite, to slow down the shrinking Birdcage.\nNot far away, on the King\u0027s Plateau, on the site of the Royal Palace, Robin, accompanied by Bartolomeo, communicates by snail phone with Viola, who tells her that Zoro and Franky are trying to slow down the \u0022Birdcage\u0022 with the strength of their arms alone. The king\u0027s daughter doubts the success of this venture, but the young archaeologist believes her friends will succeed. At the same time, on the southern side of the King\u0027s Plateau, the people of Dressrosa are revolting against the last remaining soldiers in Doflamingo\u0027s pay. They are shooting at defenseless civilians without the slightest scruple, under the pretext that this, the safest place on the island, is reserved exclusively for officers of the Doflamingo family. Suddenly, Bartolomeo, Kyros and their companions intervene and neutralize the last of Doflamingo\u0027s allies, so that the people of Dressrosa can survive by scaling the New King\u0027s Plateau, which has become the new center of the \u0022Birdcage\u0022.\nIn the center of town, Doflamingo, tired of chasing Luffy, decides to make the Straw Hat come to him by accelerating the narrowing of the \u0022Birdcage\u0022, causing general panic throughout Dressrosa. For his part, Sabo continues his battle against Jesus Burgess, who is determined to kill him in order to appropriate his power. But the commander of the first fleet of Blackbeard\u0027s fleet is no match for the second-in-command of the Revolutionary Army, who takes him down with ease. Suddenly, Sabo notices that the \u0022Birdcage\u0022 is shrinking rapidly, as is Viola, who is horrified to see the impending destruction of her kingdom.\nAt the far end of the \u0022Birdcage\u0022, Zoro, Kinemon and Kanjuro try to halt its advance with their swords, but to no avail. Meanwhile, on the Field of Flowers, Trafalgar Law lies on the ground, his arm cut off by Doflamingo now sewn to the rest of his body. He watches in horror as the compression of the \u0022Birdcage\u0022 accelerates, while Franky and the Dwarves do their utmost to stop the advance of the \u0022Birdcage\u0022 by pushing the walls of the Smile Factory, made of Sea Granite, with all their might. But nothing worked. The citizens of Dressrosa have only three minutes to live, while Luffy still needs four minutes to become himself again!\nSeeing that the only way to save Dressrosa from total annihilation is to gain time, the former gladiators of the Coliseum Corrida attack Doflamingo again, but he manages to beat them easily using his powers. For their part, the other gladiators who had fought against the officers of the Doflamingo Family, together with Leo, Kyros and Robin, try to stop the \u0022Birdcage\u0022 with the help of a Bartolomeo barrier. Leo explains to the young archaeologist how Hajrudin and the others could be healed so quickly. It\u0027s thanks to the healing powers of Princess Mansherry, who temporarily cured all the inhabitants of Dressrosa, including the gladiators, using Chiyupopo lint similar to that of dandelions. But this treatment is short-lived, and those treated by the Dwarf princess will return to their previous state within minutes! So it\u0027s a matter of life and death for everyone in Dressrosa. Meanwhile, Gats, worried that Luffy won\u0027t recover in time, meets Law and entrusts him with the Straw Hat, while the Birdcage continues to shrink inexorably...",

At the same time, Princess Mansherry\u0027s Chiyupopo plush toys are at work, instantly healing injured people by simple touch, but only for a short time. Meanwhile, with Hack carrying him on his back, Ussop tries to convince the able-bodied citizens to go and help his friends stop the Birdcage.\nNot far away, Doflamingo has finished with the former Coliseum Corrida gladiators who dared to challenge him, and orders Luffy to come out of hiding to confront him. This scene, glimpsed thanks to her Clairvoyance, terrifies Viola to the point of wanting to assassinate the master of Dressrosa. For her part, Rebecca orders the islanders to head for the Royal Palace on the plateau, which is still the safest place on Dressrosa, having received the order from her father, who was far too busy pushing the \u0022Birdcage\u0022 with all his might, along with Zoro and all their allies. Suddenly, a crazy idea crossed Rebecca\u0027s mind and she grabbed a sword, determined to fight Doflamingo. But she\u0027s beaten to the punch by her aunt, who had the same idea. Viola orders her niece to turn back, as she doesn\u0027t want Rebecca\u0027s death on her conscience. With that, she pulls a dagger from her hair, which she immediately uses to stab Doflomaingo. But Doflomaingo doesn\u0027t give in and, despite all her skill and flexibility, she can\u0027t touch him. Soon she finds herself at Doflamingo\u0027s mercy, and Rebecca can do nothing about it.\nNot far away, Franky and the Dwarves are still pushing the Smile Factory with their bare hands to halt the advance of the Birdcage, while Zoro, Kanjuro and Kinemon, who are still pushing, receive providential help from Admiral Fujitora and his Haki-savvy men to slow down the Birdcage. The rest of the Navy troops lend a hand, pushing through Bartolomeo\u0027s barrier and helping Franky and the Dwarves on the outskirts of the Smiles Factory. They are soon joined by civilians determined to save their country at all costs, and thanks to their combined efforts, they all manage to stop the Birdcage. But this is only a short respite, as Doflamingo\u0027s diabolical trap is set in motion again, much to everyone\u0027s disappointment! However, all this does not dampen their spirits, and they all start pushing again to save Dressrosa from destruction.\nWanting to gain more time, Viola attacks Doflamingo head-on, but he intercepts her blows. Mad with rage, the daughter of former King Riku tries again to drive her dagger into her opponent\u0027s neck, but Doflamingo does his best not to be hurt and soon stops Viola\u0027s arm, squeezing it with all his might before bringing her down. Viola tries to attack him again, but she\u0027s no match for him. Doflamingo soon uses his powers to manipulate Viola and Rebecca like puppets, forcing Kyros\u0027s daughter to use her sword to kill her aunt.\nNot far away, at the Smiles Factory, the \u0022Birdcage\u0022 continues to compress and attacks the flanks of the King\u0027s Plateau, much to the fear of Dressrosa\u0027s inhabitants. The situation is grave, and there\u0027s only a minute left before Luffy has to come to his senses...",

        "description": "The \u0022Birdcage\u0022 continues to work its magic, further panicking the inhabitants of Dressrosa. Some of them, like Gats, climb the walls of the King\u0027s Plateau to save their lives, while Zoro, along with Kinemon, Kanjuro, Issho and the Navy troops, work hard to slow the advance of Doflamingo\u0027s diabolical trap. The same efforts are made at the Smile Factory, where the Dwarves, with Franky\u0027s encouragement, try to stop the Birdcage once again. The same scene is repeated with the former gladiators of the Coliseum Corrida, who join forces to try and stop the Birdcage. Above them, Princess Mansherry continues to rain down Chiyupopo fluff to temporarily heal citizens injured by simple contact, while Gats, accompanied by her two collaborators, reaches a small escarpment overlooking the whole of Dressrosa.\nAt the same time, Viola and Rebecca are still in the grip of the island\u0027s master. Doflamingo uses his powers to force Kyros\u0027s daughter to burnish her sword to kill her aunt. The latter, captive, begs her niece to fight to the bitter end, but to no avail. Rebecca, manipulated like a puppet, moves inexorably towards Viola to strike her with her sword.\nFor his part, Gats speaks to the islanders by snail phone, explaining that Lucy, the young hero who had made his name at the Coliseum Corrida, much to the dismay of Cavendish, who was hoping for his 15 minutes of fame at the time, was none other than Luffy, come to defeat Doflamingo and free Dressrosa from his tyranny. Gats promises that the Straw Hat will defeat the pirate leader in a single blow. This announcement lifts the spirits of all the island\u0027s inhabitants, including the former participants in the Colis\u00e9e Corrida tournament who had not given up hope of seeing Doflamingo fall one day. To the cheers of the people of Dressrosa, Gats also announces, over the loudspeakers, that it\u0027s almost time for Doflamingo\u0027s execution. However, the effects of Mansherry\u0027s Chiyupopo lint lose their power and soon Hajrudin and the other gladiators cared for by the Dwarf princess lose consciousness! But Kabu, who is carrying her on his back, comforts her as best he can, telling her that she has brought a miracle to Dressrosa, saving the lives of many of the wounded inhabitants. Thanks to this prodigy, everyone was able to buy time for Luffy\u0027s speedy recovery. On this subject, Gats once again cheers Lucy\u0027s name, a situation that exasperates Doflamingo. The annoyed Doflamingo silences Gats by impaling him, then prepares to finish off the fight between Rebecca and Viola with a fatal blow to the latter.\nBefore this can happen, Trafalgar Law, who has been watching over the Straw Hat until he fully recovers, teleports Luffy to the scene of the fight and takes Viola\u0027s place, automatically joining the corsair. With this action, the Straw Hat manages to save the young woman\u0027s life and break the blade of Rebecca\u0027s sword with his Haki-covered forehead. Having finally recovered all his strength, Luffy prepares to end his duel with Doflamingo to the cheers of the people of Dressrosa, who continue to cheer his name...",

        "description": "Luffy manages to stop Rebecca\u0027s sword strike by swapping places with Viola thanks to Law\u0027s powers. The Straw Hat is ready for the final battle, much to the relief of Gats, who warns the people of Dressrosa of their hero\u0027s return. This situation displeases Doflamingo, who wants to settle the score once and for all. However, cheered on by all the island\u0027s citizens, Luffy proudly stands up to his enemy, who had noticed that the young pirate had only managed to recover his Haki, but that he could hardly stand on his legs.\nDoflamingo takes advantage of the situation to attack Luffy before Rebecca\u0027s helpless eyes. Rebecca soon becomes the Dressrosa master\u0027s new target, but is saved in extremis by Law, who teleports her to him after swapping places with a rock that is instantly pulverized by Doflamingo\u0027s attack. Doflamingo, annoyed at seeing his victim lose, understands what\u0027s going on when he spots Trafalgar Law at the top of the Royal Palace wall. He tells him that he will witness the Straw Hat\u0027s defeat at first hand and, with that, Doflamingo launches a new attack on Luffy, changing the location of their duel into a son.\nThe Straw Hat finds himself completely immobilized, at the mercy of his adversary. The latter sends him thousands of sharp threads to perforate the armor of his Haki, which Luffy finally succumbs to before the panic-stricken eyes of Gats and all the inhabitants of Dressrosa. Doflamingo continued to torment Luffy until he died, finally sending him crashing into a wall of the King\u0027s Plateau. Seeing his adversary seriously wounded, Doflamingo inflicts the final blow with another salvo of sharp wires, all of which hit their target. Witnessing the scene, Gats can\u0027t believe that Luffy managed to escape such an attack alive, yet the Straw Hat is still with us. He is even under the influence of Doflamingo, who uses his demonic powers to manipulate him like a puppet. The master of Dressrosa relishes the moment. As Luffy strides towards his enemy, he recalls Rayleigh\u0027s sage advice about the \u0022Kong Gun\u0022 when he was on Rusukaina Island. Luffy had noticed that this formidable attack had no effect on Doflamingo. Doflamingo continued to provoke him, claiming that it was only natural for him, holder of a very special Demon Fruit, to subjugate all his subjects to his will, who for him were nothing more than common humans to be manipulated for the rest of their lives. This revelation exasperates Luffy, who tries with all his might to rebel against Doflamingo.\nMeanwhile, the Birdcage continues its advance, ravaging all that remains of Dressrosa. The King\u0027s Plateau is half-destroyed, and the former gladiators of the Coliseum Corrida, along with Zoro, Robin, Franky and the Dwarves, continue to hold back Doflamingo\u0027s diabolical trap with their bare hands. Robin keeps Leo\u0027s spirits up, telling him to have faith in Luffy as their last hope. Indeed, even though the Straw Hat is at the mercy of his adversary, he covers his arms with his Haki and reactivates the Gear Fourth to free himself from his bonds under Doflamingo\u0027s astonished eyes. Having regained his \u0022Bound-Man\u0022 form, Luffy is ready to finish off his enemy once and for all.\nTo do so, the Straw Hat flies as high as he can to execute his final attack. For his part, Doflamingo laughs at his adversary and chases him through the air before the astonished eyes of all Dressrosa\u0027s inhabitants, who don\u0027t miss a moment of the aerial combat that is about to take place between these two terrible pirates. Luffy is determined to put an end to Doflamingo\u0027s reign of tyranny, which has lasted for so many years, but Doflamingo has no intention of doing so. As Luffy prepares to attack, Doflamingo erects a spider\u0027s web to protect him from his adversary\u0027s attack. As he bands his arm with all his might, Luffy remembers Rayleigh\u0027s recommendations and adds Gear Third to his other fighting technique. Seeing what he\u0027s about to do, Doflamingo once again throws sharp threads that are stopped dead in their tracks by Luffy\u0027s huge fist. An immense shockwave sweeps through Dressrosa, frightening all its inhabitants. However, they continue to cheer on the Straw Hat, engaged in a veritable battle of the titans. Doflamingo doesn\u0027t give in and continues to attack Luffy, who holds back as best he can. Cheered on by all his friends and allies, the young pirate uses his \u0022Kong Gun\u0022 to send a powerful blast that pulverizes Doflamingo\u0027s ropes and himself in the process, causing the complete destruction of the lower town below the King\u0027s Plateau and further panic among the throngs of citizens who have flocked there. In the company of Rebecca and Viola, now safe, Trafalgar Law silently witnessed this prodigy and fondly recalled the words of his friend Corazon, who had once told him that powerful men feared the Family of the D because it was considered the sworn enemy of the gods. This truth was confirmed when Doflamingo was defeated by Luffy, an important member of the D-Family...",

However, the people of Dressrosa must flee as quickly as possible to avoid being crushed by the rubble of the lower town, which was wiped out after Luffy\u0027s incredible punch. The rubble creates a huge hole all the way to the Trading Port, where Doflamingo falls. For his part, the Straw Hat savors his masterstroke: the island of Dressrosa is finally free of tyranny. Tears well up in her eyes as she witnesses this historic event, Rebecca can\u0027t take her eyes off the Straw Hat as it continues to fly overhead. Kyros\u0027s daughter can\u0027t help but recall her first meeting with Luffy, when he was still called Lucy. She clearly remembers the young pirate\u0027s admiration at the sight of the huge statue of the champion in the Coliseum Corrida. And now, Luffy has succeeded in freeing Dressrosa from Doflamingo\u0027s yoke and the young woman is very proud of this. For her part, Viola is also very grateful to the Straw Hat for having saved her kingdom, having been under the thumb of the sinister Doflamingo and his crew since childhood, and for having trusted him and his men when they decided to revolt against this former Celestial Dragon. As for Trafalgar Law, he watches attentively as the Straw Hat, exhausted, falls like a stone. He uses the power of his Demon Fruit to save him, swapping Luffy for a piece of debris to bring him back to the side of Rebecca and Viola, who are only too happy to find their rescuer alive.\nIn the gutted ruins of the Trading Port, Doflamingo is a shadow of his former self. He lost consciousness after being punched by Luffy. On the surface, the survivors of Dressrosa can breathe again and enjoy the new-found peace of their island. Young and old alike look up to see the \u0022Birdcage\u0022 beginning to disappear little by little. They want answers and beg Gats to explain what\u0027s going on. Supported by his two hostesses, the Colis\u00e9e Corrida\u0027s star presenter announces the Straw Hat\u0027s victory to the citizens of Dressrosa. They remember with sadness the ten long years of tyranny imposed by the Doflamingo Family on the country, and all weep with happiness at finally being freed from the cruel domination of the Shichibukai. For their part, the former gladiators, Dwarves and members of the Straw Hat Crew also see the Birdcage gradually disintegrating before their very eyes. All are delighted by this happy ending, as is Ussop, still clinging to Hack\u0027s shoulder, who is only too happy to see the sky again.\nPerched atop his promontory, Gats sees the devastation of the \u0022Birdcage\u0022 on Dressrosa and tells his fellow citizens about it. He reminds them of the exploits of the heroes of the Colis\u00e9e Corrida against Doflamingo\u0027s pirates, and of the final confrontation between the Shichibukai and Luffy. For his part, Riku remembers the dark hours that plunged Dressrosa and rejoices at the peace finally restored. The same joy spreads throughout the island, overwhelming the bravest warriors and the Tontattas tribe, who are overjoyed to have finally subdued their enemies. For her part, Rebecca, with her aunt\u0027s blessing, watches over Luffy, who is still unconscious. Not far away, Kinemon and Kanjuro can\u0027t hide their joy under Zoro\u0027s amused eye, while the Dwarves thank Franky appropriately. Even Kyros, who had never shown his feelings before, is overcome with emotion as he looks forward to a happy future for himself and his beloved daughter.\nWhile everyone applauds Luffy\u0027s courage, he has not yet regained consciousness...",

He then receives a snail phone call from Koala, but doesn\u0027t pick up. Indeed, the Revolutionary Army\u0027s second-in-command is too focused on the words of his adversary, who continues to argue with him, trying to make him lose his temper while reporting Ace\u0027s last words to him before the latter is handed over to the Navy forces. Blackbeard\u0027s man still wants to get his hands on the Mera Mera no Mi and partially succeeds in his plan by pushing Sabo to the limit, but fails to slit his throat with his knife as his opponent was faster than him and knocks him out for good using his new gifts.\nAfter getting rid of Burgess, Sabo takes over the call and suffers the wrath of his colleague, who, in the company of Hack and a few men, doesn\u0027t appreciate the fact that her superior can ignore her. At the same time, navy troops are in action all over Dressrosa to apprehend the Doflamingo Family officers and their leader, who are still unconscious. The soldiers took precautions to subdue the pirates, using Sea Granite chains to annihilate the powers of their Demon Fruits. Baby 5, a member of Don Quixote Doflamingo\u0027s crew, watches from a distance as her former master\u0027s henchmen are sent to prison, before snuggling up to her fianc\u00e9, who is not quite used to her presence yet.\nAfter Navy soldiers chain Doflamingo with Sea Granite to put him out of action, some are astonished that Issho hasn\u0027t yet reported to Navy HQ. This suspicious detail even embarrasses Vice-Admiral Maynard, who decides to take matters into his own hands by making an initial report, while soldiers try to catch up with Fujitora so that he too can report to the Navy.\nAt the same time, in the neighboring country of Applenine and on two other islands, the inhabitants are worried because Doflamingo is about to speak, but instead of the King of Dressrosa, they see Maynard appear before their eyes to inform them of the defeat of the Shichibukai who had wanted to raze the island to the ground. As for the former king, Riku, the people put pressure on him to resume his duties as sovereign, under the amused gaze of Elizabello II, who happily comments on the situation after having telephoned the kings of the various neighboring countries to announce Riku\u0027s return to the throne of Dressrosa. The initiative of the King of Prodence is welcomed by the island\u0027s inhabitants, who are overjoyed to have finally found their authentic sovereign. Then Issho and his men appear and perform a rare act: they all kneel before Riku and his subjects and apologize, on behalf of the World Government, for the ordeal endured by the kingdom of Dressrossa during Doflamingo\u0027s ten-year tyranny.\nThroughout the world, this act was relayed by skimmers, along with the official announcement of the Alliance between the Straw Hats and the Heart Crew, who had together succeeded in defeating the most fearsome and dangerous Celestial Demon on the planet...",

        "description": "Riku is stunned to see a Navy Admiral and his men kneel before him and his people to make amends for Doflamingo\u0027s sins. The scene is broadcast by skirmishers around the world. The former ruler of Dressrosa asks Fujitora to stand up, but Fujitora refuses, retorting that this kingdom had been saved by incomparable pirates and warriors, while the Navy and the World Government didn\u0027t even lift a finger in the face of Doflamingo\u0027s actions. Meanwhile, Luffy and Law enjoy a well-deserved rest on the terrace of the Palais Royal, watched over by Viola and Rebecca, who are grateful to them for having restored freedom to their country. The calm is broken by Usopp, who is desperate to find out if the Straw Hat is still alive. He is accompanied by Zoro, Franky, Kinemon, Kanjuro and Robin, who are also searching for the young pirate.\nIn the lower town, Kyros savors the happiness of a new-found peace with the Dwarves of the Tontatta tribe, whom he considers to be valiant warriors. All are overwhelmed by emotion when Kyros announces the disbanding of the small army that had so faithfully served King Riku. However, the hero of the Coliseum Corrida promises that the people of Leo will still be useful in rebuilding Dressrosa and restoring their island to its former splendor. And everyone enthusiastically congratulates Kyros. As the people of Dressrosa tend to the wounded soldiers and citizens, Issho is informed by one of his men that the video broadcast to neighboring islands of their forgiveness of Riku and his people has been a success. For his part, Riku asks Tank, his most trusted man, to bring the pirates and warriors who had fought for them to the Royal Palace, along with the homeless, for treatment.\nMeanwhile, on the Holy Land of Marie-Joie, the Council of 5 Stars and Sakazuki are furious to learn of both Law and Luffy\u0027s defeat of Doflamingo and Admiral Issho\u0027s behavior in bowing to Riku and his people for his years of neglect. A swarm of Martins Factors travels the world to relay the news of Doflamingo\u0027s defeat, which stuns the whole world but is far from a happy event. Indeed, the warring kingdoms, pirates and other men who had made agreements with Doflamingo pitied their misfortune, as the latter, defeated, could no longer honor his commitments. At the same time, in the rest of the world, every member of the Worst Generation hears the news about Dressrosa, and Kaidou is informed by X. Drake of the defeat of his Smiles supplier. He then understands that smuggling with the latter is definitely over.\nBack in Dressrosa: Fujitora receives a snail phone call from Sakazuki, who sternly lectures him on his attitude. While somewhere in the New World, Smoker, still convalescing on a Navy ship transporting the children of Punk Hazard Island to Dr. Vegapunk\u0027s lair for treatment, learns of Fujitora\u0027s actions from the newspapers and is surprised, as is his faithful Tashigi. Their superior, Sakazuki, orders Fujitora to immediately capture Law and Luffy and then to report back to him, an order Issho has been eagerly awaiting...",

        "description": "On the heights of Carta, north of the island of Dressrosa, the Straw Hats, Law, Bellamy, Kinemon and Kanjuro take a rest in the house of Kyros, who had offered them hospitality. Sabo arrives shortly afterwards to see Luffy, and all his friends are shocked to learn that he is Luffy\u0027s brother, except Robin, who already knew. Sabo then reveals that CP-AIGIS0 is in Dressrosa and must leave the island as soon as possible. The second-in-command of the Revolutionary Army advises the Straw Hats to do the same, to avoid capture by the World Government.\nThe members of the Straw Hat Crew are still astonished to learn that Ace and Luffy had another brother whom they both believed to be dead. And it\u0027s with this confession that Sabo begins to recount his past. He, Ace and Luffy had been inseparable friends since childhood. They dreamed of becoming pirates. But the day Sabo left his island, he had the misfortune to cross paths with a Celestial Dragon, who fired on his ship to sink it for flying a pirate flag. Sabo did what he could to contain the fire that was ravaging his boat, when Saint Jalmack fired a second salvo from his carbine, blowing the boat apart. Sabo wasn\u0027t dead on the spot, however, and just as he was about to drown, he was saved in extremis by Monkey D. Dragon, Luffy\u0027s own father! He took his young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to his ship for treatment, and Sabo met the rest of his crew and Emporio Ivankov, who was astonished to meet such a sickly child. Dragon gave Sabo first aid, and he woke up after his rescuer\u0027s ship had left his island and ventured out to sea. With his body covered in bandages, the young boy learned that he had been rescued by the Revolutionary Army, but had completely lost his memory. Dragon tries to jog his memory, telling him that his first name is Sabo and that he met him one night on a street corner at the time of the Grey Terminal fire. Luffy\u0027s father thinks he\u0027s a nobleman and that it would be a good idea to bring him back to his family. But Sabo, who still hasn\u0027t recovered his memory, refuses and begs Dragon to stay with him.\nAs Sabo recounts his past to the Straw Hats, the people of Dressrosa enthusiastically set about repairing the Royal Palace, while the fighters of the Coliseum Corrida take a well-deserved rest. But Bartolomeo is worried about Cavendish\u0027s presence here. He fears that the pirate with the rose will turn into Hakuba in his sleep, so he decides to chain Cavendish against his will.\nBack to the Kyros house. Sabo continues his story, explaining to Luffy\u0027s friends that he had completely lost his memory when he joined the Revolutionary Army and never wanted to return to his father, Outlook III. He accompanied Dragon and his men to their headquarters in Baltigo, to perfect his training as a revolutionary fighter. Under Hack\u0027s guidance, young Sabo practiced the art of combat, although he had retained the ability to move his body brilliantly despite the loss of his memory. Despite his lack of academic talent, Sabo learned everything he needed to know if he was ever to become a leading member of the Revolutionary Army, even taking on the formidable Bartholomew Kuma. Meanwhile, on the island of Dawn, Ace and Luffy, who still believe that their friend Sabo is no longer of this world, solemnly contemplate waiting until they\u0027re 17 to set sail and become pirates. As the years go by, Sabo befriends the young Koala, who is not pleased to see the young boy raiding the crew\u0027s food supplies. Despite these outbursts, Sabo continues his training, taking on the immense Kuma without batting an eyelid, who gives him a humiliating beating. It was at this time that he adopted his weapon: a long pipe that can be doubled for those who know how to handle it well, but Sabo was no match for Dragon and Kuma at this little game.\nOn the other side of East Blue, 17-year-old Ace set sail to become a pirate, as he had sworn. Luffy watched him set sail with a heart full of enthusiasm, unaware that Sabo, whom they thought had disappeared, was risking his life on a battlefield in an unknown land. But he was a real dead man\u0027s fool, and despite the machine-gun fire whistling in his ears, he succeeded with disconcerting ease in opening the gates of a stronghold thanks to his mastery of the Fluid. Thanks to this gift, the young boy took control of the situation, overpowering his enemies one by one with the sheer force of his arms. Meanwhile, his friend Koala was busy evacuating the citizens trapped in the fortress. After Sabo had shown everyone his new abilities, the fortress was completely pulverized. Thanks to this feat, the 17-year-old was able to lead the entire Revolutionary Army, until he learned of the promising future of a young pirate named Portgas D. Ace, a name that strangely brought back his memories. Two years later, Luffy left his native island to pursue his own adventures.\nBack to the present: Franky asks Sabo how he managed to recover his memories, and Sabo replies that it was Ace who had helped him awaken his memory...",

        "description": "Sabo returns to Baltigo after completing several crucial missions, and on the way he seems to dreamily see two figures from his past who call out to him before being interrupted by his friend Koala, who is delighted to be back at Revolutionary Army headquarters. Sabo is also anxious to get back there to provide Dragon with a full report on the operations he has carried out. When Sabo and Koala arrive in Baltigo, they notice quite a commotion. The cause of the commotion is the end of the war at the top in Marineford. When one of his subordinates calls out the names of the illustrious people who perished during the war, the name Portgas D. Ace catches Sabo\u0027s attention as if it were a name he knew well. He then examines a newspaper photo of the deceased, which brings back memories of his childhood. Tears begin to flow from his eyes and he can\u0027t contain them, much to the surprise of Koala, who doesn\u0027t understand what\u0027s happening. As soldiers from the Revolutionary Army explain how Ace was killed by Akainu, Sabo is overwhelmed by emotion and continues to weep uncontrollably over the article recounting the death of Luffy\u0027s brother. Suddenly, recalling the sake ceremony that allowed Luffy, Sabo and Ace to become brothers in their own right, the Revolutionary Army\u0027s second-in-command feels his memory returning and, staggering, he remembers that Ace with Burning Fists is his brother before fainting. When Sabo comes to, his friends are relieved to see him regain consciousness. Koala had been very worried about him and had feared for his life. However, Sabo had regained his memory and asked her to call Dragon to talk to him.\nBack to Dressrosa. In Kyros\u0027s house, everyone was fast asleep except Kinemon, Kanjuro, Zoro, Robin and Franky, who hadn\u0027t missed a beat of Sabo\u0027s story. Sabo went on to reveal that it was Ace\u0027s death that had restored his memory. He even visited Ace\u0027s grave and that of Whitebeard, who had died at the same time as Ace in Marineford. Sabo praised Ace\u0027s progress, saying that Luffy was well on the way to becoming King of the Pirates one day. Then he uncorks a bottle of sake and fills three bowls as he did when they were children. After collecting himself, he calls Koala by snail phone to ask a favor of the Revolutionary Army by helping them acquire the Mera Mera no Mi. In this way, Sabo took part in the tournament held at the Coliseum Corrida, taking Luffy\u0027s place when he was shocked to discover that his brother, whom he had thought dead, was still alive. Bartolomeo, who witnessed this touching reunion, didn\u0027t hide his emotions either. The Straw Hat granted Sabo permission to eat the Mera Mera no Mi in memory of Ace.\nHaving finished his tale, Sabo took leave of Luffy\u0027s friends and handed Zoro a Life Card after tearing off a piece to find himself. As the second-in-command of the Revolutionary Army leaves Kyros\u0027 house, Zoro can\u0027t help but think back to Ace\u0027s farewell to Alabasta. He was behaving in the same way as Sabo. Sabo received a snail phone call as he was leaving Kyros\u0027s house. It was his friend Hack, concerned about Luffy\u0027s state of health. His superior told him he was fine before hanging up. At the same time, Issho was with his men. The Navy Admiral is playing dice to find out Luffy\u0027s future. As Fujitora is blind, he asks one of his soldiers to tell him the value of the dice that came up. When the soldier told him it was one, Fujitora decreed that the Straw Hat was the winner and would not be stopped tonight. This kind of attitude greatly displeases Vice Admiral Maynard, who fears an affront to Admiral Sakazuki. But Issho puts his subordinate in his place by telling him that you can\u0027t fight fate.\nMeanwhile, at the Royal Palace, the fighters and citizens who survived Dressrosa want to thank Luffy for his bravery, but the Straw Hat is nowhere to be found. For her part, Rebecca runs to see her grandfather because she\u0027s worried about not seeing her father and Luffy at the Royal Palace. Riku reassures his granddaughter that Kyros is with the Straw Hat and his friends, who are all safe and sound. While chatting with him, the young gladiatrix learns that if her grandfather becomes King of Dressrosa again, she will assume the role of princess. While Rebecca is shocked by this news, Sabo is on the back of a huge bird which takes her to Baltigo to inform Dragon that his son Luffy is well...",

        "description": "Luffy and his companions continue to enjoy Kyros\u0027s hospitality and take a well-deserved rest at his home. Only Robin, Zoro and Franky remain awake. Still shaken by the story Sabo had told them, they are disappointed that Luffy was not conscious when the brother he thought had disappeared was there. Suddenly, Kyros wakes up and confesses to his hosts that he has listened to most of Sabo\u0027s story. He also lamented the fact that Luffy hadn\u0027t followed his story, but he had to sleep and rest first after the hard day he\u0027d been through. The hero of the Colis\u00e9e Corrida suggested that Zoro look for some alcohol in his cellar. The Swordsman of the Straw Hat Crew gladly accepts.\nKyros is grateful to Luffy for liberating his country and hopes with all his heart that Dressrosa will aspire to better days. He suddenly thinks of his daughter Rebecca and all the suffering they endured together while all the pirates fell into a well-deserved sleep. He takes advantage of this respite to write a letter, then sets off for the Royal Palace to hand-deliver it to his daughter.\nAt the same time, on a raging sea, Sanji\u0027s group, made up of Tony Tony Chopper and C\u00e9sar Clown, are on their way to Zou, but they have to face Big Mom\u0027s ship, which is doing everything it can to capture them in order to get their hands on the Punk Hazard scientist. Luffy\u0027s friends manage to outrun their pursuers and find themselves on an island. But their group is cut in two and Sanji finds himself with Chopper and Caesar, who are reluctant to move forward. Meanwhile, Nami, Brook and Momonosuke are chased by two mysterious individuals (Sheepshead and Gin Rummy), riding a huge crocodile, who eventually catch up with them. However, they are saved by a huge downpour which allows them to escape, but they are swept away in a violent torrent. Once all danger had passed, the three fugitives managed to cling onto a branch. But this respite is short-lived, as their enemies have found their tracks and are trying to kill them. As one of the assailants tries to strike Nami with his sword, his blow is stopped by Brook\u0027s fencing skills. The living skeleton proves to be an excellent swordsman, especially when his attacker tries to defeat him with his strange powers. As Brook valiantly fights off his opponent, he sees Sanji appear from the sky to lend him a hand. Thanks to his skill, the Thousand Sunny cook manages to throw his enemy into the water, while his acolytes flee, lamenting the absence of a mysterious samurai who was supposed to accompany Sanji and his friends.\nSuddenly, the flood caused by the immense downpour comes to an end. Brook and Nami wonder about the island they landed on, and whether the girl they rescued is all right. For his part, Sanji lights a cigarette while looking at his mysterious assailant, who had not risen after his defeat and is puzzled by the skull and crossbones motif on his belt. Suddenly, Momonosuke hears cries coming from the forest. It\u0027s the voice of Chopper, who must be in great danger. All his friends rush to his rescue, abandoning their enemy to his fate.\nSomewhere in the New World, in the Kid\u0027s pirate hideaway, the mood is festive. Suddenly, a huge explosion puts an end to the festivities, causing panic among the pirates and the capsizing of their ships. Eustass Kid rushes out to see what\u0027s going on and, horrified, he and his men discover a huge, human-shaped hole in the ground! Basil Hawkins, who accompanies him, deduces that it is someone who has fallen from a celestial island. It is indeed someone who has come from the sky, and more precisely from the ruined Terminal Ballon city where Urouge lives. The latter met a mysterious man who wanted to commit suicide because he was fed up with life. He jumped from the celestial island, 10,000 meters above sea level, under the amused eyes of the Mad Monk, and, after an interminable fall, landed in Eustass Kid\u0027s lair to everyone\u0027s surprise. The pirates approached to find out who had come to attack them, only to recoil abruptly when they realized they were dealing with a giant with the ability not to die. The mysterious man rises to his feet and reveals himself to be the most powerful Pirate in the world, Kaidou of the Hundred Beasts, who is about to embark on the greatest war the world has ever known...",

        "description": "Three days after Doflamingo\u0027s defeat and Luffy\u0027s victory, Admiral Issho receives a surprise visit from Sengoku and Tsuru, who have personally visited Dressrosa to find out why he hasn\u0027t yet apprehended the Straw Hats. Fujitora replies that Luffy\u0027s fate is in the hands of providence, and that for three days in a row luck has been on his side. The three naval officers then receive a visit from Mansherry, who asks for blood donations to treat the island\u0027s inhabitants. Meanwhile, Gats triumphantly announces the official return of King Riku to the throne of Dressrosa. The latter talks to his friend Elizabello II, telling him that he will try to keep his people happy while waiting for his granddaughter Rebecca to inherit his crown. At the same time, Kyros pays his respects at his wife\u0027s grave and remembers the days when he was still a toy soldier.\nAll over the island, Navy soldiers are distributing Princess Mansherry\u0027s medicinal flowers to heal the population. But suddenly, Kinemon and Kanjuro, who witnessed the scene, discover that the troops stationed at Dressrosa are increasing in numbers and decide to warn their friends of the impending assault by the Navy. While Mansherry receives blood donations from all sides to heal the people of Dressrosa, Fujitora humbly asks Tsuru to roll the dice for him. If \u00221\u0022 comes up as on other days, he won\u0027t launch an attack. But if not, he and his men would immediately set off to arrest Luffy and Law. Incredulous, Tsuru complies.\nNot far away, in Kyros\u0027 house, Luffy and all his friends have recovered and are regaining their strength by devouring the victuals brought by Kinemon and Kanjuro. The two samurai tell them about the rumor spreading around the island that Rebecca\u0027s father is a prince from a faraway land, although they all know the truth. However, Kyros confesses that it was he who started the rumor to protect his daughter and to prevent the people of Dressrosa from knowing that he was Rebecca\u0027s real father. Indeed, her birth was known only to members of the royal family and to the Doflamingo family, who had done some research. This news came as a surprise to all his friends, who didn\u0027t understand what he had done. Kyros reveals that he was ashamed of his criminal past and wanted to offer Rebecca a better future. For this reason, he had written her a letter explaining that his presence at her side was incompatible with her future life as a princess, and that she should forget him and finally lead a happy life without hiding. The former Colis\u00e9e Corrida champion was even thinking of leaving Dressrosa at the same time as the Straw Hats, so as to stay out of his daughter\u0027s life. Suddenly, they receive a snail phone call from Leo, who warns Kyros that Fujitora is on the move. Tsuru had fired the \u0022six\u0022, and Issho immediately ordered his men to arrest all the pirates on Dressrosa, including Law and all the criminals hiding in the Royal Palace. Bartolomeo, meanwhile, appears to inform Luffy and his friends that Navy troops will be arriving at any moment to arrest them. Indeed, after issuing his order, all Fujitrora\u0027s men set off in search of the fugitives, despite their services in the island\u0027s liberation, with the sole aim of apprehending them...",

        "description": "Navy soldiers, armed to the teeth, scour the streets of Dressrosa in search of fugitives, while others cordon off all access to take to the sea. Admiral Fujitora himself orchestrated the operation, with the help of Vice-Admiral Bastille. At the same time, in Kyros\u0027s home, he receives a snail phone call from Leo, who warns him that the Navy will soon arrest their friends. This situation displeases Usopp, who begins to panic as usual, especially knowing that they have no ship to flee to.\nIn the streets of the island\u0027s capital, Fujitora\u0027s troops deploy to arrest as many criminals as possible without the civilian population being able to intervene. Some soldiers head for the Royal Palace, where dozens of warriors who helped liberate Dressrosa have taken refuge. Leo warns Bartolomeo, who is with the Straw Hats, of the imminent danger. But Bartolomeo reassures him that he has planned ahead, as his men and allies, including Cavendish, have decided to lend a hand in helping the Mugiwara flee, after watching the Navy\u0027s movements for some time. He invites Luffy and his companions, including Bellamy, who has fully recovered from his wounds, to follow him towards the eastern port, where a ship is waiting to take them away from Dressrosa.\nJust as everyone is ready to leave Kyros\u0027s house, the Navy troops have found their tracks and are on their way to capture them. Bartolomeo tells his friends to flee as quickly as possible. They obey as the soldiers fire on them. To protect them from the heavy fire, Bartolomeo uses his powers to create a barrier to stop their attackers\u0027 bullets. Luffy and his friends run like hell to lose their pursuers, who continue to shoot at them. Bartolomeo asks them not to split up and to avoid crossing Fujitora\u0027s path. However, Luffy doesn\u0027t give a damn and stops running, much to the astonishment of his biggest fan. He explains to his comrades that he has one last thing to do before heading for the south of the island, which is teeming with hundreds of soldiers. The Straw Hat easily disposes of his opponents before heading for the Royal Palace.\nAt the same time, at the Palace, King Riku summons his loyal Tank to look for Viola and Rebecca, so that the two young women can accompany him to warn the island\u0027s citizens that the Riku Family has officially taken over the throne of Dressrosa. The latter complies immediately, while Viola, who has used her Clairvoyance, informs her niece that Luffy and his companions are being pursued by the Navy and are about to leave Dressrosa. Kyros\u0027s daughter is distressed to learn that her savior will soon be leaving, as she really wanted to thank him for all he had done for Dressrosa.\nFor their part, Tsuru and his elite soldiers set off, as does Issho. At the same time, near Carta Hill, Bartolomeo led the Straw Hats through the town, reassuring them that they had nothing to fear. Indeed, their allies had already occupied the East Port and dislodged the Navy garrison there, much to Bastille\u0027s frustration as he gradually loses his composure. Abdullah, Jeet and their comrades-in-arms had disabled all the soldiers stationed there, clearing the way for the Straw Hats to reach the port unharmed. A member of the Navy garrison informs Bastille that the criminals who were supposed to have taken refuge in the Palais Royal are helping the fugitives to escape. The Vice-Admiral realizes that there\u0027s no one left to arrest when Luffy suddenly appears.\nAs he tries to outrun the Navy, he runs into trouble with his elastic left arm, which has jammed. Swinging unwillingly through the air, he managed to knock out dozens of soldiers who had come to arrest him. Far from being discouraged, Luffy managed to reach the Field of Flowers, but soon found himself surrounded by Marine soldiers ready to do battle with him. This little inconvenience doesn\u0027t worry the Straw Hat, who sweeps aside his enemies with a wave of his hand before shouting Rebecca\u0027s name. Rebecca rushes to the window and sees the Straw Hat fighting the Marine while looking for her. Rebecca signals her presence and Luffy rushes to meet her, grabbing the window bars with his elastic arms. Despite the guards protecting the young princess, the captain of the Straw Hat Crew asks her if she\u0027s willing to forget her father, as he\u0027d requested in his letter. Rebecca is all debriefed and finally tells him that she couldn\u0027t bring herself to do such a thing. So she decides to follow the Straw Hat to see Kyros again, despite Viola\u0027s pleas. Rebecca managed to convince her aunt of her willingness before fleeing the palace, clinging to Luffy\u0027s neck as he burst the bars of the window. The young pirate, taking his friend with him, launched himself into the void under the noses of the Navy soldiers, while one of the palace servants warned Riku of his granddaughter\u0027s abduction. The latter is immediately enraged to learn that Rebecca\u0027s kidnapper is none other than Luffy! This news sends shockwaves through Dressrosa\u0027s population, including Gats, who believes that the Straw Hat is really responsible for kidnapping the princess.\nWith Luffy and Rebecca on the run, Maynard\u0027s Marine forces give chase. Just as his best snipers are about to take down the Straw Hat, they are stopped by an unknown force, similar to the Haki of Kings, without losing consciousness. This turn of events exasperates Bastille, who is unaware that Fujitora is behind it all. The Vice-Admiral orders all available warships to the East Port and all able-bodied men to Carta to arrest the fugitives. Just as the Straw Hats manage to reach the harbor entrance, Sengoku, who is standing there in the company of a huge gorilla, spots them. At the same time, Luffy and Rebecca leap from rooftop to rooftop to reach Kyros\u0027 house. But they are spotted by citizens who pursue them with soldiers who order them to arrest Luffy. But the Straw Hat laughs at them and continues his frantic escape with his \u0022prisoner\u0022, leaping from building to building...",

        "description": "The citizens of Dressrosa continue to pursue Luffy, who is said to have kidnapped Rebecca when the young girl had decided to accompany him of her own free will to find her father. Losing his pursuers, the Straw Hat and his friend come face to face with a Marine platoon ready to fire on them. Instead of bullets, they are hit by nets made of Sea Granite. Luffy is trapped by one of them and loses his strength, much to Rebecca\u0027s astonishment. The two fugitives are soon surrounded by the soldiers who had been ordered to capture the Straw Hat alive. But Luffy doesn\u0027t give in, and uses his powers to sow havoc with the Navy, to the detriment of Rebecca, who is unaccustomed to gliding through the air. After making sure they were no longer being followed, Luffy asks Rebecca to continue on her own while he creates a diversion. The young princess obeyed. He also asks her not to be captured, or she\u0027ll be returned to the Royal Palace. Luffy then shows her the location of Kyros\u0027s house, right in the heart of the Flower Field, and advises her to go there right away before her father leaves. The latter gathers up all his belongings and prepares to leave Dressrosa, not without a certain amount of regret, as everything dear to him is on this island: his daughter, his past and his memories.\nRebecca, for her part, has to cross a vast forest to reach her father\u0027s house, and on the way she relives her childhood memories of the time when she was happy and pampered by her mother Scarlet and father Kyros. Then came the difficult times when she lost her mother, despite the promise of Soldier Lightning Fury to do everything in his power to protect her. Rebecca runs breathlessly to stop her father from leaving. At the same time, he grabbed the handle of the door to his house to leave. But as he leaves, he too plunges back into his deepest memories of the time when Sugar had condemned him to life as a toy. He recalls his daughter\u0027s birthday party and all the joy he felt at being with her. However, he knew Rebecca\u0027s true place was in the Palais Royal, far away from him. As he was leaving his house, he came face to face with his daughter, her face sweaty and her dress torn after her mad run in the forest. Kyros couldn\u0027t believe his eyes: his beloved daughter was standing in front of him. Rebecca can\u0027t help crying. She knew that her father had spread false rumors and that she\u0027d had enough of the lies because she was Kyros\u0027s daughter. What she wanted now was to live with her father, whether he liked it or not. He agreed, and father and daughter embraced, weeping with joy.\nMeanwhile, at the Palais Royal, Viola talks to her father about Rebecca and tells him she\u0027ll never live with them again. Riku accepts his granddaughter\u0027s decision and understands that the ties that bind a daughter to her father are stronger than anything. Especially as Rebecca, like her mother before her, had asked her aunt to be Princess of Dressrosa in her place, and her aunt had agreed. At the same time, at the entrance to the Eastern Port, everyone, including Ussop, was eagerly awaiting Luffy\u0027s return. As the pirates began to bicker amongst themselves, Zoro spotted Admiral Fujitora, flying on a levitating wall, coming ahead of them to stop them. The Swordsman of the Straw Hat Crew tries to stop him using his fencing skills, but to no avail. For his part, Vice-Admiral Bastille, from his HQ, coordinates the encirclement of the Eastern Port with the aim of catching the pirates in a pincer movement. But his plan is foiled by the intervention of the Tontatta warriors, who have managed to steal the powder, bullets and all the soldiers\u0027 weapons without their knowledge. This news exasperates Bastille, who can\u0027t keep his cool. He also learns that the warships the Navy had assembled to capture the fugitives have been out of action since they were mysteriously sewn together. The height of Bastille\u0027s annoyance is reached when he realizes that a large number of soldiers were still fainting after donating blood to Princess Mansherry so that she could heal many of the still-injured citizens.\nAt the same time, the Straw Hat allies had to face Issho, who was advancing alone in front of them. Despite his blindness, the Navy Admiral is not afraid to confront these dangerous criminals, who are doing everything they can to delay him so that Luffy and Law can join them quickly. As he sets off for the Eastern Port, Luffy realizes that the fighting has already begun. For his part, Law meets up with Sengoku, who reminisces about their shared past and laments the loss of the Barrels Pirates, killed by Doflamingo, the Ope Ope no Mi, his subordinate, Corazon, whom he considered his son, and a young boy suffering from lead poisoning whom Rosinante had promised to help cure. To his astonishment, Trafalgar Law reveals that he was indeed the boy...",

        "description": "In the rubble of the Undercity, Trafalgar Law reveals to Sengoku that he was once the lead poisoned boy Rosinante had helped cure by offering him Ope Ope no Mi. He also tells him that he\u0027s a D, a confession that makes the former Admiral Commander-in-Chief of the Navy\u0027s blood run cold. Meanwhile, Admiral Fujitora takes it upon himself to personally eliminate all pirates on Dressrosa, preventing them from fleeing the island. However, Bartolomeo prevents him from carrying out his plan by erecting an impenetrable barrier in front of him. Issho is unimpressed by the pirate\u0027s power and uses his own powers to levitate all the debris on the island to form a huge, menacing cloud over his opponents. Meanwhile, Vice-Admiral Bastille receives a snail phone call from Tsuru asking if he still needs reinforcements. He replies that his men must withdraw quickly from the Eastern Port, as Fujitora has taken the lead. Not far away, on the Field of Flowers, Kyros and Rebecca witness this prodigy and the young princess worries about Luffy and the wrong turn of events.\nSuddenly, Law arrives at the entrance to the Eastern Port and orders Cavendish to set sail immediately, as there is nowhere safe on Dressrosa, while Zoro is certain that Issho will not let the pirates escape Dressrosa so easily. The latter is still determined to stop the Navy\u0027s enemies when Luffy arrives. His friends see him approaching them at full speed and advise him to run to a ship and leave Dressrosa. But the Straw Hat refuses to run away from Issho. He\u0027d rather fight Issho with a terrible Elephant Gun that crushes the Admiral on the spot than have to leave, because if he did that he\u0027d no longer be worthy of becoming King of the Pirates. His friends, led by Zoro, agree with him, but are astonished by Luffy\u0027s fighting techniques against Issho.\nWhile fighting him, the Straw Hat announces his attacks in advance out of pity for his opponent\u0027s blindness, arousing his anger. Using his gifts, Fujitora throws Luffy into the air with his sword, but the latter can\u0027t stop him...",

        "description": "Luffy is hit by Fujitora\u0027s attack, which sends him flying. However, Cavendish catches sight of him and orders Hajrudin to catch the Straw Hat in flight and bring him safely back to land. Despite Luffy\u0027s refusal to stop fighting the Navy Admiral, Cavendish orders the Elbaf giant to take him to their ship and flee Dressrosa as quickly as possible. As Zoro tries to take over by fighting Issho, Bartolomeo dissuades him by reminding him of the terms of their arrangement. At the same time, in the Eastern Port, Ussop, accompanied by Orombus, sees dozens of ships lined up one behind the other, all linked by a huge floating bridge five thousand sailors long. This gigantic armada, ready for departure, was only waiting for the Straw Hats to leave King Riku\u0027s kingdom for good.\nHajrudin and his companions arrived at the port and hurried aboard, despite the anger of Luffy, who wished to continue his duel with Issho. The latter, unhappy to see that the pirates were fleeing, unleashed his fury and sent the cloud of debris he had just accumulated over the huge Yonte Maria Fleet moored in the harbor. By sheer force of thought, Fujitora agglomerates all these fragments into a huge mass which he uses to strike at his enemies. Seeing the huge cloud approaching them, the pirates take fright and try to accelerate their escape from the danger.\nFor his part, Hajrudin continues to run across the floating bridge, shaking the whole structure with his enormous weight. He\u0027s still holding Luffy, who hasn\u0027t fully digested the fact that his friends dared to interrupt his fight. However, the atmosphere becomes heavy as the cloud Issho has created obscures the sun\u0027s rays and threatens to fall on the fleeing pirates. Without exception, they all board their chartered ships to escape the wrath of Admiral Fujitora. In Dressrosa, Gats witnesses this prodigy and tells his fellow citizens, who watch helplessly as the gigantic pile of debris moves out to sea. Even King Riku and his family are shocked and fear for the lives of the Straw Hats.\nKnowing that the pirates had no possible escape, Fujitora threatens to bring down the rubble on the fugitives, which would sink their ships. He detonated his cloud and spread it over the entire fleet. The crew, alarmed, are aware of the danger. For their part, Usopp and his comrades continue to run on the floating bridge while Issho puts his plan into action. But he is prevented from doing so by the citizens of Dressrosa, who want to get rid of the pirates themselves, as they were the main culprits behind their country\u0027s misfortunes. Issho lets them, continuing to levitate the huge pile of rubble that still threatens to fall on the enemy ships. Crowds flock to the Eastern Port to hunt down the pirates.\nAt the Royal Palace, Viola witnesses the scene thanks to her Clairvoyance and reports everything she sees to her father. At the same time, Luffy asks Hajrudin to release his embrace to see what\u0027s going on. Perching on the shoulder of the giant, who is still running, the young pirate sees the people of Dressrosa crowding the harbor in the distance. The latter led Fujitora to believe that he hated pirates, when in fact the opposite was true. Issho learns that Rebecca had returned to live with her father Kyros in his house on the Field of Flowers, and that she had never been kidnapped by the Straw Hat. He also understood that, if all those civilians continued to follow Luffy, he wouldn\u0027t dare drop rubble from the sky at the risk of killing innocent people. This was what Gats had deduced, and he encouraged all his fellow citizens to run towards the Eastern Port to facilitate their hero\u0027s escape. This token of appreciation cheered up the pirates, who continued to run towards their ships. For his part, Fujitora could only let it happen, despite his duties as Admiral of the Navy, and felt a certain joy for Luffy, whose facial features he would have loved to see, which must surely have been filled with kindness. Knowing that he could do nothing more against the Straw Hat, he wondered how he was going to get rid of the immense cloud of debris he had accumulated, much to the incomprehension of Bastille, who couldn\u0027t understand why his colleague hadn\u0027t yet taken action.\nOn the floating deck, Bartolomeo has the pleasure of introducing the Straw Hats to the Yonte Maria, the gigantic flagship of the Yonte Maria Fleet. All board the ship, where Cavendish, Bartolomeo, Xai, Ideo, Hajrudin, Orumbus and even Leo swear allegiance to Luffy with their respective crews, a total strength of 5,600 men. Luffy watches in disbelief as Bartolomeo asks him to become their leader and to take them under his wing...",

        "description": "All the pirates connected with Doflamingo are seething with rage after reading in the newspapers about the defeat of the Shichibukai by the alliance formed by Luffy and Law. They decide to form an alliance to eliminate Luffy and his allies, and set off for Dressrosa to prevent the Straw Hat from leaving the island, at the risk of laying waste to the kingdom of the Riku Family.\nAt the same time, in Dressrosa, under the constant threat of the huge cloud of debris that floats in the sky like an immense sword of Damocles, Bartolomeo pours sake into every cup of his allies to seal their alliance with the Straw Hat. But Luffy declines their offer to join his crew and refuses to drink the cup of sake offered to him, telling them that they could always come to his aid whenever he needed it, as he would do himself. Bartolomeo believes that, if he is ever to become King of the Pirates, the Straw Hat always wants to remain free and independent.\nJust as everything was working out for them, pirates, who were in business with Doflamingo, attack the Yonte Maria Fleet, but are immediately stopped by Fujitora, who gives Luffy a \u0022parting gift\u0022 by dropping debris on the enemy ships. Despite this incident, the Straw Hat\u0027s new allies still wish to pledge their allegiance to him and, before Luffy\u0027s astonished eyes, drink their sake cups in front of him while swearing to always be at his disposal when he needs them. After swearing this oath, Luffy becomes angry. But he can\u0027t help realizing that yesterday\u0027s enemies had sworn their loyalty to him, and there was no turning back now that a huge feast had been prepared in his honor to celebrate their victory over the Don Quixote family.\nOn the orders of Orombus and his subordinates, the Yonte Maria Fleet set sail from Dressrosa with all sails set, despite the rubble falling on it. Strangely enough, the debris missed its target, falling to one side, much to the incomprehension of Vice-Admiral Bastille. The person responsible for this debacle was none other than Issho, who did it to thank Luffy for putting an end to Doflamingo\u0027s crimes. But the venerable Admiral of the Navy is surprised by Sengoku who, strangely enough, doesn\u0027t hold it against him for helping outlaws escape justice.\nAs the Straw Hat pirates and their new allies celebrate on their ship, Luffy fondly recalls all his adventures on Dressrosa, including his arrival on the island, his discovery of the Toys, his meeting with Fujitora and his participation in the tournament held at the Colis\u00e9e Corrida to win the Mera Mera no Mi, the Demon Fruit once held by Ace and now belonging to his brother Sabo. He also remembers Rebecca and her promise to defeat Doflamingo once and for all to free Dressrosa from his tyranny. For her part, the ex-gladiatrix of the Coliseum Corrida stands by her father and watches the departure of the imposing armada. Rebecca wonders if she\u0027ll ever see Luffy again. Kyros reassures her that she will, before father and daughter start teasing each other. The same joy can be seen aboard the ships carrying the Straw Hats and their allies. All are looking forward to a delicious feast as they head off together to their next destination...",

Only Law is not celebrating, and seems preoccupied. Looking at the horizon, he is joined by Nico Robin, who points out that Dressrosa\u0027s ribs have long since disappeared. She asks him what he intends to do now that Dofamingo has been defeated. He simply replies not to worry about him.\nAt the same time, Rob Lucci, who has joined the ranks of CP0, is sitting next to Spandam in an alleyway in Dressrosa\u0027s capital and learns via snail phone that the revolutionary army has succeeded in stealing all the weapons stored in the Trading Port. Meanwhile, despite the devastation on the island, the citizens of Dressrosa are happily rebuilding their city. For their part, the dwarves, who have now come out of hiding, live in harmony with the humans, helping them to build statues in effigy of the liberators of the kingdom of Dressrosa before rebuilding their homes.\nFar from Dressrosa, on a stormy sea, a Navy fleet sails towards Impel Down. On one of the ships, Admiral Fujitora is enjoying a bowl of noodles in the company of Sengoku, who asks him to apologize to Sakazuki immediately, but Sakazuki refuses to do so, as it would sully his honor. Down in the hold, Doflamingo, locked up and chained, has not lost his legendary anger and curses Fujitora from the depths of his cell. Vice-Admiral Tsuru questions Doflamingo, asking what is to become of the reign of piracy. Doflamingo replied that a great war was about to begin, during which all the world\u0027s greatest pirates would be pitted against each other. At the same time, a certain Captain Jack was planning to free Doflamingo from his floating prison with the help of his men, and was preparing to attack the Navy fleet.\nNot far away, under a brilliant sky, Law and the Straw Hats are aboard Bartolomeo\u0027s ship, which has been fitted with a new figurehead in honor of Luffy and his crew. The Bartoclub leader is only too happy to have received a piece of Luffy\u0027s Life Card, which Sabo had left with his friends before he left to join the revolutionary army. The Straw Hat\u0027s new allies also received a piece, as did Bellamy, who decided to go his own way. Bartolomeo takes advantage of this moment to take his guests into his cabin to reveal the new bonuses awarded to each member of the Straw Hat Crew.
