The four youngsters soon incur the wrath of Klahadoll, the steward of Kaya\u0027s manor, a reclusive landowner. As Usopp is ill, he often comes to tell him stories to cheer him up, something the steward doesn\u0027t appreciate when he hears that Usopp\u0027s father is a pirate in the pay of Shanks.\n\nLater, Luffy and Usopp overhear a conversation between Klahadoll and Jango. The latter is in fact Captain Kuro, a bloodthirsty pirate who aspires to take control of Kaya\u0027s fortune and then kill her. But when Usopp tries to warn the inhabitants, no one listens. So it\u0027s up to Luffy, Zoro, Nami and Usopp to deal with Captain Kuro\u0027s crew, who arrive shortly afterwards.\n\nFollowing an emphatic victory, Usopp agrees to join Luffy, the newest member of his crew, on the Vogue Merry.",

        "description": "In this episode, Sanji\u0027s past is recounted. As a child, he was a cook on a restaurant boat, telling the cooks about his dream of discovering All Blue, a vast expanse of water encompassing all the other seas, when his boat was boarded by Zeff\u0027s red-footed crew. Just as they were about to set sail, a storm intensified and a wave capsized Sanji in the sea. Zeff, in a fit of compassion after hearing from Sanji that he wouldn\u0027t die before discovering All Blue, dived in to try and save the child. With his leg caught in an anvil, Zeff lost it and saved Sanji. Stranded on a large boulder in the middle of the sea, Sanji and Zeff tried to survive on the few victuals the waves brought them, while keeping an eye on the open sea from both sides of the rock, hoping that a boat would arrive.",

Against this backdrop, Luffy and his friends decide to go and confront this God, who is in fact called Ener, leading to numerous battles between all the protagonists. In the end, Luffy manages to beat Ener thanks to a clear advantage: his rubber body is totally impervious to his opponent\u0027s lightning. The passage to these islands also provides an explanation of the mysterious City of Gold and the legend of Norland, evoked by Montblanc Cricket in the Jaya arc.",

Meanwhile, Baggy and Mr. 3 try to escape the pursuing wolves by placing themselves in a wax bunker. However, the animals prove to be clever and dig through the snow to reach the two prisoners. After getting some dubious advice from a prisoner in the cell, Bon Clay and Luffy set off to find Ivankov. Heading into a forest, Mr. 2 drags Luffy, still unconscious, behind him in a basket. However, they are attacked by a new pack of wolves. Bon Clay tries to fight as best he can, but is soon overwhelmed. A burst of anger from Luffy, who has been overwhelmed by his unconsciousness, sends the wolves fleeing. Exhausted, they fall asleep in the snow. They are miraculously saved by a mysterious man who takes them to Level 5.5, Newcomer Land, where Emporio Ivankov, the man Bon Clay is looking for, reigns supreme.",

Striking by surprise at the deputy director of Impel Down, Luffy discovers, thanks to Jinbe, that this fearsome forban goes by the name of Blackbeard, a name that was not unfamiliar to him since the Peacock Hat had already met him during his stopover in Jaya. In order to please the World Government, which would reward him with a place among the 7 Great Gorsairs, he was supposed to capture Luffy first, but instead Ace was caught. This incident enabled him to secure his position as Grand Corsair. He was also delighted to learn that Whitebeard\u0027s young lieutenant would soon be executed in Marineford.

With their chances of escape halted by the lack of ships to take them away from the prison island, the Straw Hat and his companions are cornered at sea. Luffy suddenly receives a snail phone call from Jinbe, who orders him to jump into the water. Obeying his friend and using Ivankov as a sort of giant lifebuoy, Luffy and the other Impel Down prisoners slip into the transvestite\u0027s hair and ask him to emit the strongest wind he can to escape this nightmarish place. As if by magic, and before Magellan\u0027s stunned eyes, Ivankov manages to launch himself into the air with the fugitives, and his race towards the sea is miraculously halted by the unexpected arrival of a herd of whale sharks, sent by Jinbe, who save them from drowning in extremis.",

The loss of Bon Clay is still fresh in everyone\u0027s mind, but the hardest part is yet to come, as the new objective, in addition to saving Ace from certain death, is to reach Navy Headquarters.

At the same time, the Navy soldiers who have failed to catch up with the escaped prisoners warn HQ, via snail phone, of their imminent arrival. During this conversation, a sailor reveals the disturbing past of Baggy the Clown, one of the fugitives, and his close ties to Shanks the Red and Gol D. Roger, the legendary King of Pirates.

            "description": "Accompanied by Boa Hancock, Luffy travels to Impel Down to rescue his brother Ace, who is being held prisoner there. Impel Down is the underwater prison of the World Government. Impel Down is officially a 5-floor prison, unofficially a 6-floor prison: Crimson Hell (Floor 1), Beast Hell (Floor 2), Hunger Hell (Floor 3), Fiery Hell (Floor 4), Ice Hell (Floor 5) and Eternal Hell (Floor 6). Each level features a different class of outlaw, and the higher the level, the more dangerous the criminals. Level 6, meanwhile, is home to world-shattering criminals such as Crocodile, the former Grand Corsair. To reach his brother, Luffy has to cross Impel Down one by one. He encounters old acquaintances on each floor who will enable him to reach the floor below. Baggy on the 1st floor, Mr.3 on the 2nd floor, Mr.2 on the 3rd floor. Luffy and his group face a host of adversaries, including :\n\ndemon guardians (Minotaur, Minokoala, Minoceros and Minozebra)\nfloor masters (Blugori, Basilik, Manticore, Sphinx and Wolves)\nthe managers (Magellan the warden, Hannyabal the deputy warden, Saldeath head of the blugori, Sadi head of the prison guards).\nUnfortunately, Luffy arrives too late on the 6th floor, due to the confrontation he lost to Magellan and his Poison Fruit. However, this delay allows him to meet the famous Ivankov (queen of the kingdom of Kedetrav) and Inazuma of the revolutionary army on the legendary floor called Paradise in Hell (which is on floor 5.5). Accompanied by the latter and Jinbe (a great privateer locked up for opposing the war against Whitebeard) and Crocodile, who were locked up on the 6th floor, Luffy decides to escape from Impel Down. Once out of prison, he and his group became the second escapees from Impel Down, 20 years after the legendary Shiki the Golden Lion, who was the first to escape.",

To hide this despicable parentage from everyone, the young man decided to take his late mother\u0027s name and become a pirate in his own right.

Just as Luffy and his men are about to free him, Crocodile takes advantage of the situation to try and kill Whitebeard. But he\u0027s stopped in his tracks by the Straw Hat, who knows his Achilles\u0027 heel: water. The former head of Baroque Works is forced to abandon his plan and suddenly sees Luffy standing proudly before Edward Newgate. The latter recognizes him as Ace\u0027s younger brother because of the straw hat that Shanks had entrusted to him from his earliest childhood. Far from being impressed by the power of Whitebeard, who is considered the strongest man in the world, Luffy addresses him as an equal and announces without the slightest embarrassment that he will save Ace and become the next King of the Pirates.",

The pirates accelerate their advance, but Kizaru enters the fray, hurling a deadly beam of light at the Straw Hat, which is quickly deflected by Emporio Ivankov, who saves his life once again. However, the former master of Newcomer Land is attacked by Bartholomew Kuma, who tries to stop him. For their part, Jango and Fullbody, two members of the Marines and old acquaintances of the Straw Hat, try to stop Luffy on the orders of their superior Hina. But their tactics fail: Jango hypnotizes himself, and Fullbody with him. Luffy miraculously escapes Hina\u0027s attack using the Gear Second technique. Meanwhile, Whitebeard\u0027s allies battle with the vice-admirals and Squardo, a pirate captain allied with Whitebeard\u0027s crew, meets someone who seems to know him. Meanwhile, Moria, leading an army of zombies, tries to halt Luffy\u0027s advance. Luffy still intends to save Ace, but the latter begs him to give up. The Straw Hat\u0027s brother\u0027s fate is already sealed, and nothing and no one can change that. But Luffy is stubborn, and will do anything to save his brother, even if it means dying. While Jinbe valiantly battles the zombies of Gecko Moria, purifying them with sea water, Sengoku, the Admiral Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, confesses to everyone that Luffy is the son of Monkey D. Dragon, the leader of the revolutionary army.",

Kizaru takes advantage of the situation to grab him and slam him hard against the ground. Meanwhile, Sengoku orders the executioners to execute Ace, but Crocodile intervenes, claiming that he had come to Marineford to kill Whitebeard, not to let the Marine forces win. The former head of Baroque Works must now fight Doflamingo, who has come to arrest him. For his part, Luffy runs like hell to the scaffold, but is stopped in his tracks by Admiral Aokiji, who blocks his path. The Straw Hat is saved in extremis by Marco, who hits Aokiji with all his might as he tries to finish off the young pirate. While Mr. 3 hides to avoid being frozen by Aikiji\u0027s power, Whitebeard\u0027s pirates rush in through a breach in the encircling wall. The Navy soldiers retaliate with cannon fire. Edward Newgate saves his men\u0027s lives by using a ship he has hidden nearby. Thanks to this subterfuge, Whitebeard\u0027s men enter Marineford and are ready to do battle with the opposing forces. Aware of the situation, Sengoku and Garp, Luffy\u0027s grandfather, are forced to fight against the attackers, who have arrived in large numbers.",

Jinbe, for her part, takes him in her arms and flees. Whitebeard, furious at seeing his son\u0027s murderer attack his brother, decides to face Akainu in single combat. Using the powers of his Demon Fruit, Newgate generates a terrible earthquake that severely damages Marine Headquarters, splitting the ground in two and isolating him from the rest of his men.

To avenge the death of his two sons, Ace and Satch, Edward Newgate begins a fierce battle against Blackbeard. Even using his powers to nullify those of his terrible adversary, Whitebeard delivers a fatal blow to his assailant with his bisento, and then attempts to slice Blackbeard\u0027s body in two by holding him by the throat. But Marshall D. Teach is the strongest and manages to free himself quickly. He orders his men to attack Whitebeard all at once. The poor pirate, alone against all, receives dozens of saber, rifle and cannon blows through his body without even flinching. After a while, the killing stopped and Newgate remembered his last encounter with Gol D. Roger, the legendary King of Pirates, and his desire to start a family one day. After recalling these tender memories, Whitebeard died on his feet, telling Blackbeard that he was not the right person for Roger. With a final sigh, he also declared that One Piece really did exist, before finally succumbing, still standing and proud that no bullet had pierced his body.",

It was a no-go zone inhabited by many homeless people. There, he sees his friend attack two men carrying treasure. Gol D.\u0027s son Roger managed to grab it and lost his pursuers as they ran towards the forest. Luffy discreetly follows and discovers that Ace had an accomplice named Sabo. Garp\u0027s grandson eventually discovers their secret hideout, much to the panic of the two boys, who had no wish to associate with this young troublemaker who wasn\u0027t their age. But Luffy is suddenly captured by Porchemy, one of Bluejam\u0027s subordinates, a notorious pirate who wreaks havoc in the region. The young boy is tortured by his kidnapper into revealing Ace and Sabo\u0027s hideout, in order to recover the loot these two rascals had stolen from him. But Luffy stubbornly remains silent. Enraged, the pirate threatens to kill him. Just as he\u0027s about to do so, Ace and Sabo, aware of the danger Luffy is in, appear in Bluejam\u0027s lair to save their new friend.",

Makino tries to calm Dadan down by telling him that Luffy is very upset about his brother\u0027s death. When the mayor of Fuchsia, Hoop Slap, asks for news of the Straw Hat, Dadan, in a burst of pride, asserts that Luffy will never be defeated. Meanwhile, in the New World, Shanks the Red attends the funeral of Ace and Whitebeard, who are buried next to each other. The ceremony was so moving that the scarred pirate couldn\u0027t hide his tears, mourning the loss of his friends. After bidding them farewell, Shanks left the New World. At the same time, on Amazon Lily, Luffy is still reeling from his brother\u0027s death. Jinbe tries his best to comfort him, telling him not to blame Ace\u0027s actions. Furious, the Straw Hat tries to fight his friend, but the Fishman is stronger than he is and easily defeats him. Having regained his senses, Luffy listens attentively to Jinbe\u0027s wise words. Jinbe explained that he had to overcome his grief and that there were others waiting for him in this vast world. These words cheered Luffy up, and he immediately thought of the friends he wanted to see again.",

Far from being discouraged, the valiant swordsman wants to continue the fight, despite Mihawk\u0027s refusal. At the same time, in the Kingdom of Torino, Chopper is captured by a human tribe and tries to escape. But the little reindeer is stopped by giant birds. Thinking his last hour had come, he sees the tribe befriend the birds and Chopper is finally able to breathe. He then reads the newspaper and learns what had happened to Ace in Marineford. Meanwhile, on Weatheria, Nami continues to perfect her knowledge of meteorology and works hard to acquire new fighting techniques. She also reads the newspaper and realizes that something serious has happened during her absence. Meanwhile, on the Boyn Archipelago, Usopp has become obese despite the objections of his friend Heracles. Despite his enormous overweight, he learns what had happened at Navy Headquarters, and the news deeply upsets him. Not far away, in the Kingdom of Kamabakka, Sanji has become an okama. He waits for the sun to set so he can become himself again. He too receives the newspaper and is horrified to learn of Ace\u0027s disappearance. Meanwhile, Robin, still imprisoned at Tequila Wolf, decides to see her friends again, while Franky, after defeating a mechanical bear, has managed to unearth a small supply of cola. As he recharges his batteries, a fax machine starts working beside him, printing out the newspaper with the latest news on the Battle of Marineford. This information is also known to Brook, who is prostrate in his cage, where he has been locked up by the Long-Armed Tribe, and is stunned. As for Zoro, humiliated once again by another defeat against the baboons, he learns of the death of Luffy\u0027s brother from Mihawk.",

Meanwhile, Robin heads for Bartigo with members of the revolutionary army. She, too, is determined to become stronger. Usopp, meanwhile, is trying to lose weight and begins a strenuous workout with his friend Heracles, who tells him about the benefits of Pop Green, hostile plant seeds found in the Greenstone Forest on the Boyn Archipelago. At the same time, on the Isle of Sorrow, Zoro humbly asks Mihawk to train him in the art of swordsmanship, but Mihawk refuses. He changes his mind, however, when he learns that his guest has defeated all the baboons on the island, and is eager to become stronger for his captain. So the swordsman agrees to become his teacher. Perona soon learns from Zoro what exactly the strange inscription on Luffy\u0027s right arm means. The letters and numbers, 3D2Y, mean that the Straw Hat Crew\u0027s rendezvous will not take place in three days (THREE DAYS) as planned, but in two years (TWO YEARS). Zoro will take advantage of this time to perfect his sword-fighting skills by taking on the baboon chief, who has mastered all Mihawk\u0027s techniques by dint of having seen him in action.",

Zoro gets there first and heads for the bar run by Shakky. He has changed a little over time, having lost an eye, and now sports a long scar on the left side of his face, giving him a darker side. A few days later, Nami appears, more beautiful than ever: she\u0027s let her hair grow. She\u0027s drinking alone in a bar, but is noticed by a crew posing as the real Straw Hats. Usopp, who has beefed up his muscles, arrives shortly afterwards and uses one of his Pop Greens to neutralize the fake crew. At the same time, Sanji approaches the archipelago after being transported by Ivankov\u0027s okamas. His appearance has also changed: he has grown a fine moustache and a small goatee, and his wick now covers his right eye instead of his left. Robin is one of the last to arrive at Sabaody. Her bangs are gone and she\u0027s become even more beautiful. As for Brook, he\u0027s become a world-famous singer known as \u0022Soul King Brook\u0022. Chopper has a new hat and is as fond of cotton candy as ever. As for Franky, he\u0027s upgraded his cyborg body. No sooner has he arrived in Sabaody than he\u0027s off to examine the Thousand Sunny.

Each has come back stronger, which is useful, because at the same time, pirate \u0022look-alikes\u0022 have usurped the identity of the Straw Hat crew and tried to recruit among the most dangerous pirates. Luffy and his crew are spotted by the Navy when they re-establish the truth, while the Navy tries to arrest the \u0022look-alikes\u0022. Then the head of the scientific division, Sentomaru, appears. Seeing the deception, Sentomaru defeats the latter very easily, before Luffy, Zoro and Sanji manage to destroy some Pacifistas in their path. The crew reunite on the boat, and head for Fishman Island, diving into the sea with Thousand Sunny then encased in a large bubble.",

Nami was shocked by this confession and, with Camie\u0027s help, fled the palace to seek help at the Marine Forest, where Jinbe had arranged for Luffy to meet him. The battle begins and, as he confronts the Straw Hats, Hody destroys a wall of the palace, creating a breach that completely floods the courtroom. Zoro asks his companions and the king, who has been released from his chains, to flee while he remains alone to prevent Hody from pursuing them. The fight between Hody and Zoro is fierce. But the Fish Man is in his element and forces the swordsman to fight him underwater. On his way to the Marine Forest, Megalo unwittingly spits out Princess Shirahoshi, who appears before the inhabitants of Fishman Island. Thinking that the members of the Straw Hat Crew were responsible for kidnapping the princess, they try to stop Luffy, Sanji and Chopper.

While the Queen was desperately trying to collect signatures so that the Fish-Men could one day cohabit with humans in harmony, the Sun Pirates made a name for themselves on the surface of the oceans. Their reputation outstripped their own, and even reached the ears of Vice-Admiral Borsalino, who could not deny that these new forbears of a different kind would upset the balance of the world if they were not stopped. Three years after Tiger attacked Terre Sainte de Marie-Joie, the Sun Pirates met Koala, an 11-year-old girl. She was a former human slave whom Tiger had freed. The captain agreed to take her aboard his ship. Still traumatized by her past, the little girl behaved like a slave, always smiling and never complaining so as not to be killed by the Fish-Men. This attitude exasperated Tiger so much that he decided to cover the slave mark Koala had on her back with the symbol of the Sun Pirates, to show her that the Pisces-Men were very different from the Celestial Dragons, the little girl\u0027s former torturers. He even promised to take her back to her native island. Moved to the very depths of her being, Koala was at last able to express the emotions she had had to repress for so many years, and began to weep loudly as she thanked her saviors.",

As he grew closer to Koala, the Fish-Man realized that Queen Otohime\u0027s arguments were justified, and that a rapprochement between Fish-Men and humans could be possible. Using an Eternal Pose to locate the girl\u0027s native island, Fisher Tiger decided to take her back to her village himself. But the suspicious villagers had warned the Navy forces, commanded by Rear Admiral Strawberry, of the Fishmen\u0027s imminent arrival on their island. They were ambushed. Their ship was badly damaged, but many managed to escape after rescuing their captain from the Navy\u0027s clutches. Tiger, however, was seriously wounded during the skirmish, and succumbed to his injuries on board a Navy ship his men had managed to commandeer. Refusing to be transfused with human blood, which was compatible with his own, he forced his crew to promise him, before his death, that they would no longer hate humans, and that they would not pass on this hatred to future generations of Fishmen, even after confessing his painful past as a slave.",

Once there, he attacked the crews of the Navy ships stationed on the island, but was defeated by Vice-Admiral Borsalino, future Admiral Kizaru, who had been waiting for his arrival. He overpowered him with a beam of light, slightly injuring him. Following this forceful arrest, Arlong was interrogated at length and then imprisoned at Impel Down. Jinbe, who now had a free hand, became \u0022The First Son of the Sea\u0022, i.e. captain of the Sun Pirates. Recognized as a major threat to the Navy, he was offered the position of Grand Corsair. Fishman accepts so that he can free Arlong, who has a fierce hatred of humans, and let the Sun Pirates return home in peace. After his release, Arlong is furious at this arrangement and violently attacks Jinbe, who defeats him in single combat. Following this altercation, the Sun Pirates split into three groups who went their separate ways: the first was led by Jinbe, the second by Arlong and the third by Macro, a dissident pirate.",

As the subjects of the Ryugu Kingdom administered first aid to Miosgard, he began to insult them, demanding that they bring him a mask to avoid breathing the same air as them. Full of rage, the Celestial Dragon orders his former slaves to return with him to the surface. This arrogance exasperates former Sun Pirates like Aladdin, who have returned to live in peace on the Isle of the Fishmen, and want to kill this detestable character. But Queen Otohime arrives on the scene and stands between her subjects and the Celestial Dragon, who takes advantage of the situation to take the sovereign hostage by aiming the barrel of his golden pistol at the temple of Princess Shirahoshi\u0027s mother, who is present with her brothers, if his demands are not met...",

Meanwhile, Jinbe, having recovered from his wounds, once again challenges Luffy to a duel in order to dissuade him from fighting Hody. He fears that if the Straw Hat takes on the fearsome captain of the New Crew of Fishmen in single combat, it will prove to his fellow creatures that humans are a very violent and untrustworthy race...",

Then, in the meantime, Hody Jones confesses to all his men gathered in the square - at least 100,000 outlaws, all from the Fishman District - that he is the one responsible for the assassination of Queen Otohime. This revelation fills all the inhabitants of Fishman Island with horror, including Shirahoshi, who already knew the true identity of his mother\u0027s murderer.

Yet, even knowing this, the young princess preferred to keep silent to respect the promise her late mother had made to her four children. After hearing Shirahoshi\u0027s story, the leader of the New Crew of Fishmen laughed at her and ordered that King Neptune and Princes Fukaboshi, Ryuboshi and Manboshi be executed on the spot. At the same time, Madame Shirley, despite her injury, informs a group of children that her forecasts do not give the exact date for the destruction of the Isle of the Fish-Men, and soon its inhabitants start calling on Luffy to take action, since their fate is now sealed. For her part, Princess Shirahoshi pleads with all her might for the Straw Hat to show up and save the life of her father, who is about to be beheaded by Hody himself. Luffy doesn\u0027t hesitate. Hiding in Megalo\u0027s belly, he suddenly emerges from the shark\u0027s stomach and delivers a tremendous kick that sends Hody crashing to the mat. At the same moment, Nami appears, warning Robin that she has recovered the Celestial Dragons\u0027 letter to Queen Otohime and the keys to the prisoners\u0027 chains. The young archaeologist, before Shirahoshi\u0027s astonished eyes, frees her and her brothers. The latter looked after their father, and the four of them buried themselves on the back of Hoe, the royal whale in the eyes and beard of their captors. Suddenly, the other members of the Straw Hat Crew arrive aboard the Sunny, suspended in the sky by a huge air bubble. Franky suddenly activates the Gaon cannon, whose deflagration causes chaos in the ranks of their enemies. Once their ship has landed, the battle between the Straw Hats and the new Fishman Pirates is imminent. Robin takes advantage of this moment to set Jinbe free, who is delighted to join Luffy in battle against Hody Jones and his men, before the stunned eyes of the inhabitants of Fishman Island.",

Meanwhile, the Noah, scarred by Decken\u0027s touch with his power, comes dangerously close to Fishman\u0027s Island so that the huge ship crashes into Shirahoshi and the island\u0027s inhabitants. Vander Decken, comfortably aboard the ship, was ready to do anything to kill the Mermaid Princess, even if it meant losing his own life. The arrival of this immense ark causes panic among the inhabitants of Ryugu Kingdom, who begin to flee in all directions. At the same time, Hody discovers the true nature of his partner\u0027s plan. He feels betrayed and immediately becomes furious. Mad with rage, Hody pursues Decken, who has ruined all his plans, leaving Luffy to his fate. Luffy decides to follow him and protect Princess Shirahoshi, who has just been wounded in the shoulder by a dagger thrown at her by Decken. After asking Sanji to stay with the islanders to protect them, he sees Princess Mermaid, writhing in pain, moving as quickly as possible away from Fish Island. The Straw Hat uses his elastic man powers to climb aboard the Noah after Jinbe hands him a Bubble Coral so the young pirate can fight easily underwater.",

He quickly grabs hold of one of the huge arch\u0027s chains and begins to climb up to join Hody, who is already aboard the ship. Some of the inhabitants of Fishmen\u0027s Island try in vain to stop the huge ship, which continues to pursue Princess Shirahoshi by pulling on her chains, but Hody Jones doesn\u0027t give them the chance. Abandoning the ship, he attacks them without mercy. Seeing this, the Mermaid Princess decides to take to the high seas through a passageway leading to it, in order to lure the Noah and Hody away from the Ryugu Kingdom. Still clinging to one of the ship\u0027s chains, Luffy suddenly runs out of air and activates the Bubble Coral given to him by Jinbe before leaving to avoid drowning. Unfortunately, Hody notices his presence and starts fighting him. As the Fishman is at ease in the water, he bursts his opponent\u0027s air bubble and soon Luffy is on the verge of succumbing. The Straw Hat is saved in extremis by Prince Fukaboshi, who has come to his rescue. Both witness a disturbing scene. While Princes Manboshi and Ryuboshi order their younger sister to swim higher and protect her from Decken, Hody Jones confronts Vander Decken and stabs him with his trident. The captain of the Flying Dutchman succumbs to his wounds and soon the Noah, freed from Decken\u0027s Targeting Power, begins a dizzying fall, heading dangerously towards Fishman Island.",

Once again, the young mermaid is saved by Luffy and his brother, Prince Fukaboshi. Meanwhile, on the Isle of Fishmen, Wadatsumi, Vander Decken\u0027s sea monk, defeats the Kraken using the powers of drugs before attacking Jinbe. Fortunately, the valiant Corsair Captain doesn\u0027t give in and administers a lightning kick to Wadatsumi just as he\u0027s about to throw a punch. Having hurt his hand badly, he collapses heavily to the ground, and the blast of his fall knocks over Nami, who was fighting Hody\u0027s men with her climatic stick. Sanji witnesses the scene and, fulminating with rage, kicks the monster in the head, who doesn\u0027t understand the cause of his behavior. He soon sees Sanji and Jinbe standing up to fight together. While Robin uses the powers of his Demon Fruit to defeat his opponents, Hyouzou, one of Hody\u0027s seconds, swallows a large quantity of steroids while drinking alcohol. He quickly becomes uncontrollable and attacks his own allies, who are unable to dodge his fearsome sword blows. He soon sees the young archaeologist and decides to attack her. But Zoro intervenes and saves his friend\u0027s life by blocking Hyouzou\u0027s attack. While provoking him, the intrepid swordsman takes advantage of this moment to tell him that the fight he was about to undertake with him would be great training before heading for the New World, their next destination. At the same time, Luffy realizes that his attacks are ineffective when he\u0027s underwater. Yet, with Hody glaring at him, the Straw Hat vows to protect everyone, as he has been trained to do so for two long years.",

But Hody is having none of it and, waiting for Decken to breathe his last, pursues the princess by any means necessary. Princes Fukaboshi, Manboshi and Ryuboshi try to oppose him, but without much success. Just as Decken was about to take revenge on Hody by hurling an axe at him from inside the Noah, his strength failed him and he finally expired. As he died, his power disappeared with him, and soon the Noah began to slow down, then stop, before beginning a vertiginous fall towards the Isle of the Fish-Men!",

Her three brothers try to step in to defend their sister and Luffy, but all three are defeated by the dreaded steroid-doped Fishman. The Straw Hat is then forced to fight Hody, and chooses the Ark as the location for the confrontation. But knowing the young pirate\u0027s weakness, Hody destroys the air bubble enveloping the Noah, forcing Luffy to fight underwater. Just when all was lost, Prince Fukaboshi comes to the Straw Hat\u0027s rescue, saving him from certain death. Then, King Neptune\u0027s eldest son faced the captain of the New Crew of Fishmen in single combat. The battle was fierce, but Fukaboshi, for all his valour, was no match for such an adversary, who treacherously stabbed him to death before his sister\u0027s horrified eyes. Frightened, she obeys her wounded brother\u0027s orders to swim as far as possible with Luffy alongside the ark. For his part, thanks to a snail phone given to him by Prince Fukaboshi when he was with him, the Straw Hat receives a call from those in charge of the Air Tank above Fishman Island. They inform him that they have prepared a huge air bubble with all available reserves capable of completely enveloping the Noah. This procedure won\u0027t stop the ship\u0027s fall, but it can be easily deflected so it won\u0027t hit its target. What\u0027s more, those in charge of the Air Tank only have one shot at this, which they must not waste in vain. For his part, Hody, who hasn\u0027t yet guessed the Straw Hat\u0027s plan, attacks poor Shirahoshi again, but Luffy stands between the princess and the Fishman. After shattering his weapon, the Straw Hat delivers a lightning blow that infuriates Hody. Swallowing another dose of steroids, Hody suddenly transforms, becoming even bigger and more powerful. Just as he was about to attack him again, Luffy receives a call from Fukaboshi on his snail phone. In a weak voice, Shirahoshi\u0027s older brother tells him that he has discovered who Hody really is...",

The latter, unhappy at not being able to defeat such tiny opponents, gets angry and bloats up on steroids, unknowingly crushing his own allies with his hands.

He admits his mistake and immediately joins the Straw Hats and Jinbe with his own men.

From their earliest childhood, the officers of the New Crew of Fishmen had always been taught that humans belonged to an inferior race, as they were unable to breathe underwater. Based on this argument, Hody and his crew vowed to wipe them all out to ensure the survival of their own species. And the more time passed, the more obsessed they became with the idea. So much so that Hody enlisted with his men in the ranks of the royal army. They committed many crimes, and even celebrated the death of Queen Otohime, who was determined to bring humans and Fishmen closer together. It was at this time that the captain of the New Fishmen Crew began to consume and produce large doses of steroids, which were to guarantee him even greater power in the years to come. After these revelations, Fukaboshi, with tears in his eyes, laments the circumstances that led to the death of his beloved mother. His hatred of humans has done far too much harm to his people, and he wants to make amends. He begs Luffy\u0027s forgiveness before joining him to fight Hody Jones\u0027 murderous insanity. The Straw Hat, happy with this alliance, prepares to fight Hody again after learning that the Air Tank is ready to launch a huge air bubble completely surrounding the Noah before it crashes on Fishman\u0027s Island.

Recovering quickly from his injuries, he once again uses the Red Hawk to weaken his opponent. But Luffy is surprised to see Hody still standing after this powerful attack. Meanwhile, Chopper reveals to his friends that he can reach Monster Point by crunching just one Rumble Ball. After this revelation, Usopp, Franky, Sanji and Jinbe are about to finish their fight with their respective opponents. Meanwhile, Luffy, far from demoralized, attacks Hody again, using a new fighting technique - the Elephant Gatling Gun - to finally knock out his enemy. But time is running out, as the Noah is about to crash on Fish Island. Knowing what would happen to his friends if he did nothing, Luffy evacuates the unconscious Hody, then once again uses the Elephant Gatling Gun to destroy the ark before it completely annihilates the Ryugu Kingdom!",

At the same time, all Hody Jones\u0027 men have been defeated and are fleeing from the Noah, which is approaching dangerously close to them. For their part, the royal authorities, who have regained control of the Ryugu Kingdom, try to speed up the evacuation of the island, but to no avail. Thinking their end was near, the inhabitants all remembered the human who had protected them 20 years ago: Whitebeard, an old friend of King Neptune\u0027s, whose valour bore a striking resemblance to that of Luffy. With the support of his crew, the islanders and Neptune\u0027s men, Luffy continues to destroy the Noah with a vengeance, while feeling the wound from his last battle with Hody reopen and draw blood. Princess Shirahoshi helplessly watches Luffy\u0027s determined attacks. As the Straw Hat gradually loses its strength, the Sea Kings, gigantic sea monsters summoned by Shirahoshi, arrive to stop the Noah in its tracks by pulling on its mooring chains. Luffy, exhausted, faints and falls into the wreckage of the ark, losing a lot of blood. At the same time, on Fish Island, everyone notices that the Noah has stopped falling and finally understands that all danger has finally been averted. Overjoyed at this outcome, the inhabitants of Ryugu Kingdom rejoice and celebrate with dignity the feat of the Straw Hat, who had saved their island at the risk of his own life, thus contradicting Madame Shirley\u0027s dire prediction.",

Meanwhile, King Neptune\u0027s guards have managed to find the missing mermaids safe and sound at Ryugu Palace, but no trace of their kidnapper, the infamous Caribou. King Neptune and his entire family beg forgiveness for falsely accusing the Straw Hats. Meanwhile, Luffy is finally brought back to Fish Island, but urgently needs a blood transfusion (group F) to be saved. However, none of the island\u0027s inhabitants are willing to respond to the Straw Hat Crew\u0027s distress, as the law prohibits this exchange between humans and Fishmen. Just when everyone thought Luffy\u0027s fate was sealed, Jinbe steps out of the shadows and, as a pirate (and therefore an outlaw), offers to donate his blood to save his friend\u0027s life.

Embarrassed by such popularity, Luffy and his friends leave Tuna Rope Square. Indeed, Luffy and Zoro are afraid of being considered heroes, and thus of sharing food and sake with the rest of the inhabitants. A little later aboard the Sunny, Jinbe politely rebuffs Luffy\u0027s proposal, telling him that he still has things to take care of in Ryugu Kingdom. However, he promises to come and meet him when all this is settled, and will join his crew if Luffy is still willing. Suddenly, Princess Shirahoshi and a royal soldier invite the Straw Hats to the palace to celebrate their victory over Hody Jones. The whole island goes out of its way to offer the pirates a banquet worthy of the name. While the party is in full swing, Robin isolates himself with King Neptune to talk to him about something important. Two years ago, on the celestial island of Skypi\u00e9a, the young archaeologist had discovered that a Poneglyph lurked on the Isle of the Fish-Men. It was this inscription that she had previously read while in the Marine Forest. Robin then mentions what she had discovered: there was once a Mermaid Princess who had the gift of being able to control the Sea Kings, powerful sea creatures. It seems that Shirahoshi has inherited this power. Yet the Poneglyph concealed other equally disturbing information: one concerned Noah\u0027s Ark, and another dealt with the life of a mysterious character named Joy Boy, who was said to have a close link with Poseidon, one of the three famous great ancient Weapons...",

Jinbe takes advantage of this moment to tell them about the battle between two Navy Admirals vying for the position vacated by Sengoku. Everyone is surprised to learn that Akainu has become the new Chief Admiral in place of Aokiji. King Neptune talks to his daughter Shirahoshi and Robin about the Poneglyphs found in the Marine Forest and explains all he knows about the Ancient Weapons. But their conversation is overheard by Caribou, who has managed to evade the guards\u0027 vigilance. The bandit discreetly takes advantage of this to head for the young princess\u0027s room, with the aim of kidnapping her using the powers of his Demon Fruit and selling her back to Sabaody for a very good price. But his plan is foiled and Luffy manages to chase him off, much to everyone\u0027s relief. But Caribou had time to steal the treasures from the Ryugu Palace under the very noses of the guards. Meanwhile, in the Palace\u0027s gaols, a strange metamorphosis is taking place in Hody Jones\u0027 men and in himself. Under the effect of the steroids they had taken in excess, they had aged considerably, but still retained their hatred of the royal family and humans. Neptune explained to his guests the dangerous side effects of these energy pills, which were not to be misused. After this unfortunate incident, the party continues in full swing until the arrival of two of Big Mom\u0027s emissaries, Baron Tamago and Pekoms, who demand sweets for their captain.

The Tamate Box, stolen by Hody ten years ago, is now in Luffy\u0027s hands. But the Minister of the Right, fearing another theft, had filled it with explosives at the time. He feared that Luffy\u0027s attempt to open it would cause the contents to explode. For his part, Caribou, still on the run, went in search of the treasures Luffy had taken from him and discovered that they were now the property of Pekoms and Tamago, without knowing that it was the Straw Hat himself who had given them to their captain, the terrible Big Mom, so that she wouldn\u0027t destroy the Ryugu Kingdom, to the great displeasure of King Neptune and Nami, who dreamed of acquiring all this fortune. Claiming that these treasures were rightfully his, Caribou challenged Pekoms to a duel. But the forban is quickly defeated by Big Mom\u0027s henchman, who easily crushes him with a well-felt punch to the stomach. After this incident, Luffy and his friends are escorted to the main port of Ryugu Kingdom in the company of King Neptune on his whale Hoe, Princes Fukaboshi, Ryuboshi and Manboshi and Princess Shirahoshi riding her shark Megalo. As they are hailed as heroes, the Straw Hat is overjoyed to see Franky aboard the Sunny, decked out and ready to go again. Meanwhile, on the surface of the oceans near Red Line in the New World, a fierce battle is taking place between the G-5 Navy and pirates whose ships are mysteriously emerging from the depths of the sea. Vice-Admiral Smoker, assisted by his loyal Tashigi, has taken command of the Navy\u0027s ships. He interrogates the pirates he has just captured. They turn out to be former prisoners enslaved by Hody Jones of the Fishman District. Threatened, one of them confesses to Smoker that he and his men have been freed thanks to the Crew of the Straw Hat, a piece of information that doesn\u0027t surprise the phlegmatic naval officer, who immediately gets back on the hunt.",

Throwing the Straw Hat into the sea, he is miraculously saved by Zoro, who dives in to retrieve it, while Shuzo explains to Momonga the reasons for his attack. A former Navy Vice-Admiral, he joined the Neo-Navy to eliminate all the pirates swarming the New World and serve the ambitions of Z, his superior. Seeing the situation worsening, Lily decides to intervene and, using the powers conferred by her Demon Fruit, transforms herself into a giant to attack Shuzo, who is threatening the existence of her father and friends. But Sanji is there to protect her. The young girl\u0027s life is also threatened. At the same time, Momonga, reluctant to collaborate with a pirate, agrees to fight alongside Luffy to stop Shuzo\u0027s actions.",

The centaur, defeated by Luffy, warned his leader by snail phone of the imminent arrival of the Straw Hats. At the same time, obeying her maternal instinct, Nami decides to stay and save the children, even if it means fighting their mysterious attackers. For his part, Brook eagerly awaits the return of his friends on the Sunny. To kill time, he builds snowmen when he is interrupted by the samurai\u0027s torso, which attacks him by surprise.",

Smoker, who has accidentally borrowed Tashigi\u0027s body, soon believes that it\u0027s a kidnapping, and that one of the kidnapper\u0027s accomplices is hiding among their crew. On the pirate side, Brownbeard tells Luffy and his friends about the island\u0027s extraordinary history: the famous Doctor Vegapunk was conducting research on prisoners taken captive on Punk Hazard. But one day, one of his experiments went wrong. A huge explosion destroyed two of the island\u0027s three buildings, releasing a toxic gas. Smoker explained to his men that Caesar Clown, not Vegapunk, was solely responsible for this scientific fiasco. As a result, the \u0022guinea pigs\u0022 on Punk Hazard were abandoned on the island by the World Government, which refused to save them. Paralyzed by the gas, they lived for a year until the arrival of a mysterious figure who gave them back the use of their legs. They all called him \u0022Master\u0022 in gratitude. The story of Punk Hazard ends with a serious incident: in the third building of Vegapunk, a centaur one day asked the Master for help. The Master tested a new medicine on him. But the remedy did more harm than good: the centaur could no longer breathe, and the Master left him to die in the gas. This unfortunate event enabled C\u00e9sar Clown to devise a plan which, in the long term, would make him the world\u0027s greatest scientist, surpassing Doctor Vegapunk himself!",

        "description": "This is in fact a double episode lasting a total of 48 minutes. The first part corresponds to episode 99 of Toriko, which is entitled Foncez, arm\u00e9e la plus puissante! Toriko, Luffy, Goku! (Saikai Toriko to Rufi! Kaisen no mi o sagase!, \u518d\u4f1a\u30c8\u30ea\u30b3\u3068\u30eb\u30d5\u30a3\uff01 \u6d77\u9bae\u306e\u5b9f\u3092\u63a2\u305b\uff01) and the second part to episode 590 of One Piece. These episodes were released to mark the second anniversary of the Toriko anime and the March 30, 2013 Japanese theatrical release of Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods. Characters from the various anime series take part in a gastronomic competition organized by the International Gourmet Organization (IGO) to win Carat meat, reputed to be the best in the world. However, Goku, Toriko and Luffy are tied. Meanwhile, Zoro, Zebra and Vegeta accidentally run into each other during the race and start fighting. At the same time Mansam, the Director of the IGO, begins to decide who will win the meat that Mr. Satan accidentally obtains. His rivals try to retrieve it, but only Mr. Satan remains standing in the arena. This feat makes him the lucky winner of the tournament. However, Mr. Satan decides to share the meat with characters from all three anime series, leading to a happy ending. But what they don\u0027t know is that the real purpose of the tournament was to attract the attention of a sea creature called Akami, also nicknamed the \u0022Sea Gobbler\u0022. This creature appeared in front of everyone and attacked Mr. Satan, Usopp and Gohan, absorbing their vital energy before leaving. Their companions then devise a plan to defeat this formidable enemy: the strongest of them will be able to capture Akami and eat him, as the animal\u0027s meat is very delicious. Some characters try to catch him, such as Sanji, Piccolo, Franky and Gotenks, but are quickly defeated. Akami then turns his attention to the most powerful contestants and ruthlessly attacks Goku, Toriko and Luffy. They must combine their powers if they are to defeat this fearsome monster together.",

Clearly explaining how his creature was able to cross the lake, Caesar Clown began to boast that he was the greatest scientist on the planet, when Luffy appeared, determined to capture him by firmly encircling him in his elastic arms.",

        "description": "Sanji, Kinemon, Brook and Zoro see Smiley\u0027s little body parts flying through the air. Suddenly Brook remembers a story about a special kind of mud that can eat women\u0027s clothes. Zoro, who laments the fate of the lake\u0027s fish, is not pleased by this saucy memory. He noticed that this very strange viscous substance was falling into the water and threatening to kill the fish. This situation was not to Sanji\u0027s liking either, as he was in a hurry to find the samurai\u0027s torso at the bottom of the lake. Heedless of the extreme cold and the risk of damaging Nami\u0027s admirable body in which he found himself, the cook removes his coat to plunge bravely into the icy water to find Kinemon\u0027s missing torso. Nearby, Law talks to Mone to give Chopper, left alone in the laboratory, enough time to make an antidote to cure the children. At the same time, Luffy confronts Caesar Clown, holding him firmly between his elastic arms. But the mad scientist manages to escape by turning into gas. His joy is short-lived, however, when he discovers that the Straw Hat is immune to poison. The master of Punk Hazard then uses his \u0022Gas Tanet\u0022, a kind of castanet filled with gas to create an explosion, and his faithful Smiley to suffocate Luffy. But Luffy doesn\u0027t give in and grabs Caesar Clown again. Luffy defends himself and hits his assailant with incredible force, knocking him out. Robin, Franky, Tashigi and Smoker also suffer the same fate as the Straw Hat. Meanwhile, Law and Mone are walking down a long corridor when the pirate suddenly feels a violent pain in his chest. He collapses to the floor, and soon sees a mysterious figure appear before him.",

At the same time, on an uncharted island in the New World occupied by G-5 men who bully the inhabitants into taking whatever they please, some of them beg Rear Admiral Yarisugi for help in finding their children, who have been missing for three years. But this arrogant naval officer coldly told them that their children had long since died in an accident, and that there was no longer any point in searching for them, on the orders of his superior, Vice-Admiral Vergo, who had signed the expert reports. But what the parents of the kidnapped children don\u0027t know is that their offspring is alive and well and currently on Punk Hazard. Meanwhile, on the island, Caesar has managed to get his hands on the children Nami and Usopp had tried in vain to save, who were in the grip of madness. The Master of Punk Hazard managed to coax them back into his laboratory by offering them sweets. Not far away, Zoro\u0027s group is still battling with Smiley, who is furious after Kinemon dared to destroy parts of his slimy body. He decides to take revenge by sending them huge bundles of toxic sludge, forcing the Straw Hats to take refuge in Clown\u0027s laboratory. As they run, guided by the samurai who has regained all his body parts, our heroes are unaware that the rest of the crew, along with two members of the G-5 and Law, have been imprisoned by Clown. Indeed, Luffy, Robin and Franky, their hands shackled by chains made of Sea Granite, find themselves in the same cell as Tashigi and Smoker. Vergo and Mone soon appear to check on their health. Meanwhile, Caesar\u0027s clown soldiers carefully close all the entrances to their leader\u0027s laboratory, leaving the G-5 soldiers stranded outside. The latter find themselves surrounded by the various parts of Smiley\u0027s body, which reconstitutes itself to better attack them with its slimy mud. In the prison where the Straw Hat and his fellow prisoners are being held, Vergo and Mone discuss the Punk Hazard Master\u0027s plans, without knowing exactly what they are themselves. Smoker begs Vergo to save his men from certain death, but Vergo doesn\u0027t care. Tashigi\u0027s superior then realizes that his colleague has aided Caesar in the abduction of the giant children in the New World by falsifying investigation reports. This act hardly surprises Trafalgar Law, who explains to his cellmates that Vergo is not a trustworthy person, as he was once a pirate without faith or law. He was a member of Joker\u0027s crew, a fearsome forban. While Vergo threatens to kill Smoker and Tashigi for knowing too much, Luffy asks Law who it was, and the Corsair Captain confides that this \u0022Joker\u0022 works for the World Government, and reveals that this mysterious character is none other than the most feared of the 7 Great Corsairs, the infamous Don Quixote Doflamingo...",

Not far away, in the wreckage of Doctor Vegapunk\u0027s former Laboratories 1 and 2, Nami and Usopp watch helplessly as Caesar Clown arrives to take back the children. The two members of the Straw Hat Crew immediately realize that this man is responsible for the children\u0027s abduction. While the children are happy to see the Master of Punk Hazard again, who has promised to give them sweets, Usopp and Nami try to fight him off, without the slightest success. Using the powers of his Demon Fruit, he asphyxiates the two pirates in the same way he had done with Luffy, then forces the craving children to get rid of the two troublemakers who had sequestered them by beating them with huge iron bars and rocks. Believing their last hour had come, they are saved in extremis by Brownbeard, who everyone thought was dead. The ill-tempered forban had come to meet Caesar in order to exact his revenge and demand the return of his crew. Skilfully wielding a huge pipe, he tried to hit Punk Hazard\u0027s master, but to no avail. Punk Hazard orders the children to leave the ruins of the laboratory and take refuge in his airship outside. Nami and Usopp take advantage of the situation to pursue them, leaving Clown and Brownbeard to fight together. But the pirate is no match for the Master of Punk Hazard, who uses his Gas Tanet to bring him down. Luffy\u0027s two friends also suffer the same fate. At the same time, near the lake that divides the island in two, Zoro\u0027s group is still being pursued by Smiley on the way to the laboratory. Clown\u0027s slimy creature is getting angrier and angrier, and is reassembling all his scattered pieces to become bigger and bigger. Meanwhile, in front of Caesar\u0027s laboratory, the soldiers of Unit G-5 try to bazooka their way into the building to free Vice Admiral Smoker and Captain Tashigi, who are imprisoned with the Straw Hat. As they do so, they are startled to see Smiley\u0027s viscous body parts moving in the same direction as them. At the same time, inside the Punk Hazard Master\u0027s laboratory, Vergo and Mone are quietly enjoying a cup of coffee as if nothing had happened. Quietly, camouflaged under a half-open book, Chopper, who has found out exactly what Clown\u0027s drug is made of, tries to free Luffy, Robin and Franky from the cage in which they are locked. But a noise startles him and the little reindeer has to hide. At the same time, the giant children, who have boarded Caesar\u0027s airship to get to his laboratory, are begging for sweets from the guards accompanying them, and some of them are asking where their saviour has gone. The latter is quietly seated in his cabin and informs his subordinate Mone via snail phone that he has recovered the giant children who were buried with the Straw Hats without the slightest difficulty. For her part, Mone explains that the Navy soldiers are trapped outside the laboratory after having captured three members of the Straw Hat Crew, and that everything was ready for Caesar\u0027s little experiment to be immortalized for posterity by two Video Den Mushi. This news delights the Master of Punk Hazard, who can\u0027t wait to show his most loyal customers - including two famous Supernovae, Eustass Kid and Killer - his new weapon of mass destruction...",

At the same time, the children, aboard their benefactor\u0027s airship, are returned to the laboratory, where Caesar orders his subordinates to ensure that his restless hosts never escape again. However, Mocha, one of the kidnapped children, is overcome by hallucinations and mistakes one of Clown\u0027s men for a monster, gradually beginning to glimpse the sinister truth in which she and her comrades live as they make their way of their own free will to the Chamber of Biscuits. Meanwhile, in the debris of Laboratories 1 and 2, Nami, in Sanji\u0027s body, and Usopp regain consciousness. They realize that the children have disappeared and decide to find them, without worrying about Brownbeard, who is still unconscious. Not far away, in the private apartments of the Master of Punk Hazard, Vergo and Mone eagerly await the return of Caesar Clown over a cup of coffee. The latter arrives and is delighted to find his two right-hand men. He reveals that in the past he had made a deal with Trafalgar Law, now his prisoner, who had promised to give him his heart in exchange for Mone, Caesar Clown\u0027s beautiful secretary. But now everything has changed, with Vergo now holding the pirate\u0027s heart, which he tortures mercilessly before the horrified eyes of Luffy, who doesn\u0027t understand what\u0027s happening to his friend. For his part, Clown shows his prisoners the heart of Smoker that he has in his possession, until he is interrupted by Mone, who tells him that the broadcast is ready. On the video transmitted to the four corners of the island and several parts of the New World, where Clown\u0027s shadowy men are attentively observing the scene being broadcast, an enormous candy can be seen, which turns out to be the weapon of mass destruction concocted by C\u00e9sar Clown. The latter had christened it Shinokuni, while the Master of Punk Hazard tells his acolytes about the failed experiment four years ago which accidentally gave birth to his faithful Smiley. As he spoke, at the center of the ice island, Zoro and his companions were still trying to escape Smiley\u0027s toxic fumes, which continued to pursue them.

Zoro and his friends, accompanied by Kinemon, witness this scene at the same time as Clown\u0027s men who, like them, start running at full speed to avoid being killed by their master\u0027s creature. The creature dies in the process, its remains spreading over the icy lands of Punk Hazard, whose scent reaches a sack of apples on board a wagon brought in by Clown\u0027s subordinates. As he breathes his last, Smiley loses his powers and soon one of the apples in the bag turns into a Demon Fruit. Smiley\u0027s body, meanwhile, metamorphosed into a poisonous gas that quickly spread across the island. In the confusion, Zoro\u0027s team and Caesar\u0027s men fled in opposite directions. On their way to their master\u0027s laboratory, they were exposed to the deadly gas, which petrified them in an instant, before the horrified eyes of Luffy, Robin, Franky, Law, Smoker and Tashigi, still captive. This horrific scene, transmitted via video snail phone, is seen across the entire island of Punk Hazard by Caesar Clown\u0027s shadowy men scattered across the New World and the soldiers of the G-5 unit desperately trying to penetrate Clown\u0027s laboratory. Meanwhile, in the wreckage of Laboratories 1 and 2, Nami, in Sanji\u0027s body, and Usopp come to the aid of Brownbeard, who is in a very bad way following Punk Hazard\u0027s lightning-fast master stroke. Lifting the giant pirate with all their might, Usopp begs him not to die. In a last burst of pride, Brownbeard listens to him and gets to his feet, determined to take his revenge on Caesar Clown, who had betrayed him. But soon, threatening smoke appears on the horizon, as Nami and Usopp look on in horror. Brownbeard takes it upon himself to save them by inviting them to ride on his back to Caesar Clown\u0027s laboratory, where the pirate\u0027s crew is being held. For their part, Zoro and his companions do their utmost to avoid being overtaken by the deadly gas, which is approaching dangerously close. They decide to run faster and see a strange dragon ahead, heading in the same direction as them. At the same time, Luffy and his friends, locked in their cage, witness their comrades\u0027 misfortune. The Straw Hat can do nothing to help them. Clown takes advantage of this situation to approach him and decides to experiment with his new weapon of mass destruction on his prisoners, while Chopper watches helplessly. Using a crane, he releases the cage containing his victims, which appears in front of Captain Tashigi\u0027s soldiers, still \u0022stuck\u0022 in the body of Vice Admiral Smoker, who had failed to enter Caesar Clown\u0027s lair. Suddenly, the naval officer sees the immense toxic smoke in the distance, and immediately understands that his end is near. This fear is not shared by Franky, Robin and Luffy, who take the situation in their stride. For his part, Trafalgar Law tells the Straw Hat to go ahead with the plan they had concocted together and explains that it was high time to pay Caesar back.",

However, Franky must take leave of his friends to protect the Sunny, which was moored nearby. Meanwhile, Zoro and Nami\u0027s group are still running from the dangerous fumes of Shinokuni.

Now safe at last, the men of the G-5 unit threaten Luffy and his friends with their weapons and prepare to apprehend them. But Trafalgar Law interrupts their move, claiming to have found a way to escape this nightmare island through a mysterious passageway known as the R-66, located in the R Building. The Navy soldiers are reluctant to follow a pirate, but quickly change their minds when their chief, Vice-Admiral Smoker, forces them to obey the Corsair Captain. Smoker then orders Tashigi to take command of his men and rescue the children, as he still has unfinished business with Vergo, who has betrayed the Navy. Smoker isn\u0027t the only one who wants to answer to someone, as Luffy is ready to take his revenge on Caesar Clown. But before he does, Zoro reminds his friend of an important detail: they are now in the New World, where they must never let their guard down.

All remember with emotion their comrades who fell victim to Shinokuni\u0027s deadly fumes. But the Marine soldiers were unable to mourn for long, as a mysterious dragon began to attack them, spitting fire at them. The soldiers are horrified to discover that this strange animal is invulnerable to their weapons, and can even crush steel with its teeth! However, Vice Admiral Smoker\u0027s subordinate does not admit defeat and bravely confronts their fiery assailant with her sword. Suddenly, the latter takes fright and flees with wings. The object of his terror soon appears before Tashigi\u0027s frightened eyes in the person of Vice Admiral Vergo. The latter is acclaimed by his men as their savior. But their joy was short-lived, for Vergo was no longer the man Tashigi had known in the past. Turning on his heel, he slaughters the survivors of the G-5 unit without mercy, using his combat skills to the full. Tashigi tries to defend her men against Caesar Clown\u0027s henchman, but is easily overcome by him. Just as Vergo was about to give her the final blow, the young woman, with tears in her eyes for having failed to protect her men, is saved in extremis by Sanji, who hits Vergo with all his might using his Devil Leg. Vergo is sent crashing into a wall, unable to comprehend what has happened to him. Just when everyone thought Sanji had defeated him, Vergo rises against all odds, determined to take his revenge. Meanwhile, the members of the Straw Hat Crew, accompanied by Kinemon who is still searching for his missing son, notice Sanji\u0027s absence. They are unable to take advantage of this moment of respite, however, as the dragon that had previously attacked the Marine soldiers attacks them in turn. Brownbeard explains to his new allies that the animal chasing them is uncontrollable and violent, and that the only way to subdue it is to administer sedatives. Spitting fire, the dragon attempts to injure Luffy\u0027s companions, but Brownbeard is having none of it, and runs breathlessly to outrun their dangerous pursuer. At the same time, somewhere in Caesar Clown\u0027s laboratory, Chopper comes to the rescue of Mocha, one of the kidnapped children, who is still suffering from hallucinations, knocking out the three guards who were trying to take him to his friends. The brave reindeer, understanding the little girl\u0027s pain, gives her a sedative to calm her down. Having regained his senses, Mocha agrees to help Chopper, and the two of them head to the House of Cookies to prevent the other children from eating Clown\u0027s tampered candy by blocking the door leading to it. Nearby, Luffy and Smoker finally arrive at the entrance to Building C, where they expect to find the Master of Punk Hazard Island in the company of Vergo. The pirate and the naval officer both enter Caesar Clown\u0027s private room, while he angrily orders Mone, who is worried about Vergo\u0027s fate, to open the passageway linking Building A to Building B so that Shinokuni can enter to petrify their enemies. But Luffy is against the idea and delivers a lightning punch right into Clown\u0027s stomach.",

Each employing their own skills, the mythical beast is swiftly brought down by Brook and Kinemon, who take great pleasure in slamming into the animal\u0027s lifeless body. Away from the hustle and bustle, a little girl explains to two of Clown\u0027s henchmen that she had seen a boy named Momonosuke enter a secret room of the Island Master, where he had been transformed into a dragon...",

But the task proves difficult, and the young reindeer finally fails, reverting to his original form. Meanwhile, Luffy continues to battle Mone, who proves to be a formidable adversary. Using her powers, she almost kills the Straw Hat by freezing him completely. But this was without counting on Luffy\u0027s stamina, who uses the power of the Fluid to get out of this predicament. He launches a lightning counter-attack against Caesar Clown\u0027s henchman, who is cornered on the edge of a large hole filled with garbage.

Mone laughed at him, telling him that the only way to escape this hole was to fly. Not far away, the pirate privateer Trafalgar Law begins to destroy Building D, where the SAD is manufactured, when he is interrupted by Vergo, who attacks him using his long bamboo stick reinforced with Combative Fluid. At the same time, in the Biscuit Room, Mone, who had gotten rid of Luffy, prevents Mocha from escaping with the candy from the Master of Punk Hazard Island. But her plans are thwarted by the members of Luffy\u0027s crew who, despite the absence of their leader and with the help of Kinemon, don\u0027t want the harpy to harm the frightened little girl.

As she flees, the little girl remembers arriving on the island of Punk Hazard with another child her age, Sind, aboard a boat. She also remembers her encounter with the local master, who offered his sympathy and benevolence and swore to take good care of them. Back to the present: Mocha continues to run, while trying to reason with her comrades who are in a state of withdrawal. While she\u0027s running, Mone fights Zoro before abandoning him to try and kill Nami, Chopper and Robin with her spears. But her attempt fails when the fencer\u0027s pugnacity forces her to continue the fight with him. At the same time, Luffy and Momonosuke are still trying to get out of the garbage chute where they\u0027re trapped by trying to fly through the air. But Kinemon\u0027s son, exhausted, collapses, dragging the young pirate down with him. As they fall, Clown, quietly ensconced in Building R, watches the Shinokuni advance and the desperate flight of Sanji and the surviving members of the G-5 unit through cameras in every corner of his laboratory. He also observes his collaborator\u0027s fierce battle with Zoro. Nearby, Brook, Kinemon and Usopp continue to search for Sea Granite handcuffs while trying to avoid being caught by the toxic gases of Clown\u0027s weapon. Just when all seemed lost, Sanji and the Marine soldiers enter the Chamber of Biscuits and witness Zoro and Mone\u0027s fight. The newcomers immediately fall under the spell of the young woman, only to discover that she is in fact a harpy! Once the surprise has worn off, Caesar Clown\u0027s dangerous accomplice starts attacking the members of the G-5 unit using her powers. They try to counterattack, but to no avail. Then Captain Tashigi intervenes. After carefully barricading the only exit to the Cookie Room to prevent Shinokuni from pursuing them there, she joins Zoro, against his advice, to fight with him against the dreaded Snow Woman.",

The swordsman of the Straw Hat Crew is very reluctant to fight a woman, and a harpy at that! Nevertheless, he remembers his previous meeting with Vice-Admiral Smoker\u0027s right-hand woman in Loguetown in the pouring rain. Tashigi bears a striking resemblance to his departed friend, behaving just as well with her swordplay as with her verbal jousting. He leaves Tashigi to fight alone against Caesar Clown\u0027s henchman, who uses the full extent of his snow-woman powers to defeat his opponent. Meanwhile, Usopp is still trying to shake off Shinokuni\u0027s deadly gases, taking refuge in a strange refrigerated room containing mysterious jars of frozen animals. At the same moment, Kinemon sees a bullet bouncing down a corridor before hearing the cries of children. Leaving Brook\u0027s emaciated body behind, he discovers a room where dozens of children dressed in white have taken refuge. Asking where his son is, he frightens them. Brook comes at that moment and provokes the same fright. But one little girl knows Momonosuke and offers to help find him. Not far away, Mocha continues to run with Clown\u0027s candy to prevent her sick friends, who are chasing her, from grabbing it. Nami, Robin and Chopper, who are behind her, help her by slowing down her pursuers. The doctor on board Luffy\u0027s crew takes the opportunity to administer an antidote to the giant children Robin had managed to stop with her powers. At the same time, at the bottom of Building C, the Straw Hat braked his vertiginous fall by clutching a hand to the metal wall. With his other hand, he managed to catch Momonosuke in extremis, who was unconscious as a result of his failure. Aware of his revenge on Caesar, Luffy puts Kinemon\u0027s son on his back and begins the ascent to the surface, using his fists to make his way along the wall. At the same time, in the Biscuit Room, the battle between Tashigi and Mone reaches its climax. Using all her sword-fighting techniques, the naval officer is powerless against the ferocity of the snow-woman, who takes great pleasure in sinking her icy fangs into her shoulder. Tashigi is in agony. Zoro, enjoying the spectacle, breaks his passivity to finish off Mone once and for all. Using the \u00cettory\u00fb technique, he cuts Caesar Clown\u0027s accomplice in half before Tashigi\u0027s stunned eyes. The snow-woman attempts a final attack, but is stopped dead in her tracks by Smoker\u0027s second-in-command, who kills her with a well-placed saber thrust. After the fight, the two fencers leave the Chamber of Biscuits, but just as they\u0027re about to leave, Tashigi collapses in pain before Zoro\u0027s eyes, who rushes to her aid. Caesar Clown, who has been watching the whole scene on a monitor, is not sorry for the loss of his faithful collaborator and hopes that all the members of the Straw Crew will make their way to Block R to find a quick and painful death in the toxic fumes of Shinokuni. The Master of Punk Hazard lets out a sinister laugh, unaware that at the bottom of Building C\u0027s landfill, Luffy is angrily beginning his ascent to freedom, carrying Momonosuke, still unconscious, on his back...",

But the children are desperate to force the little girl to give them the poisoned candy. She is saved in extremis by Nami and Robin, who each use their most powerful fighting technique to halt the children\u0027s advance. As for Chopper, he takes the opportunity to administer a sedative to bring Clown\u0027s guinea pigs to their senses. At the same time, in the Biscuit Room, a fainting Tashigi gradually emerges from her coma. She is startled to notice that Zoro is carrying her on his shoulder as she runs. Suddenly, she sees Shinokuni\u0027s toxic fumes seeping through the gaps in the door she had specially sealed. If the two of them don\u0027t get out of this adventure alive, Clown\u0027s weapon of mass destruction will invade the whole of Block B. Not far away, Mocha pauses in her run and stops at the top of the steps of a huge staircase. As she tries to catch her breath, she realizes she\u0027s lost her way. The poor little girl can\u0027t enjoy this moment of respite, as she is suddenly assailed on all sides by giant children who want to get their hands on the appetizing candy she\u0027s carrying. She lets out a heart-rending cry, which Chopper perceives thanks to his acute hearing. The little reindeer immediately rushes to Mocha\u0027s aid. Mocha is in a very bad way: her best friends Kombu and Biyo are trying to force the huge candy out of her hand. Chopper, Nami and Robin arrive on the scene and try to intervene to save the little girl. But other children appear behind them to stop them. Knowing that Clown\u0027s treats are bad for her and her friends, she struggles to force them to see reason: if they continue to eat the candy from the Master of Punk Hazard Island, the children will never return home to their parents. To persuade them to stop, Mocha sacrifices himself, under Chopper\u0027s helpless eyes, by swallowing whole armfuls of Clown\u0027s candy under the wrathful gazes of his comrades. The Straw Hat Crew\u0027s doctor tries to force Mocha to spit out the candy, reminding him what it is: a horrible poison. As strange pinkish vapors emerge from her nostrils, Mocha swallows all of Caesar Clown\u0027s candy, remembering the promise she and her friends made when they were all in the Cookie Room: to set sail when they grow up to find a treasure island. She also remembers her last meeting with Chopper when they were blocking the door to the House of Biscuits. The little reindeer had told her of Caesar\u0027s sinister plans, and that neither she nor her friends would ever return home alive! After seeing these images again, Mocha spits blood in front of Nami and Robin\u0027s frightened eyes. The little girl collapses at the foot of the stairs in front of her friends, who can\u0027t believe their eyes. Chopper also witnesses the scene, and can\u0027t help remembering the words he spoke to Mocha: if she and her friends continue to eat Clown\u0027s candy, they\u0027ll never reach adulthood, and will soon die. But Mocha doesn\u0027t want to die, and cries her eyes out. Chopper promises that Luffy, his captain, will personally take care of Caesar Clown and put him out of his misery. The little reindeer asks his new friend to keep all their benefactor\u0027s sweets in the House of Cookies until further notice, so that no more children can eat them. Back to the present: Mocha is prostrate and spitting blood in front of the giant children, who are astonished that such a delicious candy could cause such symptoms. Armed with a syringe containing the antidote, Chopper races to save his friend before she dies. The giant children have calmed down and watch in disbelief as Mocha dies. Suddenly, men from the G-5 unit, commanded by Sanji, jump on them to immobilize them. Luffy\u0027s cook explains to his friends that Vice-Admiral Smoker\u0027s subordinates know how to give injections. With their help, all the giant children can be cured, but this is not the case for Mocha, who is rushed on men\u0027s backs to an examination room where Chopper will try to save her in any case, so that she can one day become an adult. Not far away, in C Block, a huge explosion shakes the building before the stunned eyes of Clown\u0027s henchmen in protective suits. Emerging from the rubble, Luffy, who has wrapped Momonosuke, still unconscious, around his body, neutralizes his opponents using the Haki of Kings. Nevertheless, he lets one of Caesar\u0027s accomplices live, so that he can tell him where his master is hiding. Now knowing where he is, the Straw Hat begins his advance towards Block R...",

        "description": "Shinokuni, Caesar\u0027s deadly gas, is spreading in every nook and cranny of the Punk Hazard Island Master\u0027s laboratory. It even begins to fill Building B, where the members of the Straw Hat Crew, the surviving soldiers of the G-5 unit and the children are housed. Zoro, who continues to carry Tashigi on his shoulder, finds himself trapped by the gas. He is forced to turn back to prevent himself and Tashigi from becoming the next victims of Caesar\u0027s weapon of mass destruction. At the same time, Sanji and the surviving members of the Navy continue to vaccinate the children in need, with the help of Robin, who immobilizes the most recalcitrant using her powers. Not far away, in the infirmary of Clown\u0027s laboratory, Chopper encourages Mocha to hold on, despite the fact that the little girl has sacrificed herself by ingesting all of Caesar Clown\u0027s candy. At the other end of the building, Kinemon is desperately trying to find his son Momonosuke, much to Brook\u0027s dismay as he and the samurai\u0027s path is blocked by gas. Meanwhile, Brownbeard arrives at Block R, Caesar Clown\u0027s lair. He sees no trace of the master of the place or his subordinates. He decides to explore further, hoping to flush out his enemy. A few yards away, Usopp continues to search for the Sea Granite handcuffs he desperately needs to stop Clown. Suddenly, he arrives at a heavy door and hears a noise. Intrigued, he puts his ear to the door to get to the bottom of it. He has unknowingly discovered Caesar\u0027s hiding place, as he and his men in wet suits watch Brownbeard\u0027s arrival in Block R. Some of his subordinates panic as the pirate searches every nook and cranny of the building for them. This insidious appearance seems to upset their leader. Indeed, Brownbeard arrives at the entrance to door R-66, where he sees a skyscraper. He understands that he is being filmed, and uses this medium to inform his men, who have joined Caesar, that their new master is a liar and that they are in grave danger if they stay with him. Knowing that the pirate is on the first floor of Block R, Clown decides to go and meet him, escorted by all his men who are still alive. Brownbeard then sees the Master of Punk Hazard appear before him, complimenting him on his state of health. This annoyed the pirate, who let him know. What he wants is to get back his own men, who have been duped by Clown. Clown vaguely remembers them and coldly admits to Brownbeard that he had tried to help them by sheltering them in his laboratory, but that in the end they were Shinokuni\u0027s unfortunate victims. This revelation enrages the pirate. He tries to capture Clown with his own hands, but is unable to do so due to his opponent\u0027s gaseous state. Worse than that, Clown has treacherously administered a muscle relaxant that is beginning to paralyze Brownbeard\u0027s entire body, leaving him unable to tell his men that they have become Caesar\u0027s guinea pigs. His exasperation grows when he learns that it was Clown himself, not Vegapunk, who was solely responsible for the terrible explosion that ravaged the island four years ago. Exposed to the laughter of his men, the pirate tries to get the upper hand by attacking Clown head-on with his sword. Clown immediately orders his subordinates to shoot Brownbeard. They do so, and the pirate collapses heavily in front of them. Clown steps forward to deliver the coup de gr\u00e2ce, but is prevented from doing so by the arrival of Luffy, who delivers a powerful punch reinforced by Fluid. Luffy, accompanied by Momonosuke, stands face to face with Caesar Clown, then advances towards Brownbeard to check that he\u0027s still alive. For his part, Caesar Clown orders his men to get back upstairs before the arrival of the Straw Hats and the Navy soldiers who will soon be the future victims of his experiment. He also instructs some of his subordinates, seated in front of consoles, to communicate the progress of his projects to his shadowy agents scattered all over the New World. While Caesar is in command, Momonosuke remembers clearly who was responsible for the abduction of the giant children. It was none other than Clown himself (something Luffy already knew). Luffy learns from his enemy the true secret of Punk Hazard Island. It shouldn\u0027t even exist, making it the ideal place for his evil experiments, in particular the design of SAD. Thanks to this product, C\u00e9sar is able to design Smile, which has the power to create Zoan-type Demon Fruits ad infinitum. The moment of revelation continues when Clown confesses that the owner of this factory is none other than Don Quixote Doflamingo, who has the supreme ambition of providing one of the Four Emperors with a whole army of Zoans. Faced with this new threat, Clown tells Luffy that he still has time to abandon his plans if he wishes to save his life. In response, the Straw Hat, far from giving up, throws another punch at his adversary, promising to fight on, whatever the cost...",

        "description": "Caesar advises Luffy not to underestimate Don Quixote Doflamingo, for he himself is the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of this great pirate and of the Four Emperors who share the New World. But the Straw Hat doesn\u0027t care, and violently strikes the master of Punk Hazard Island, using the full power of the Fluid under the astonished eyes of Clown\u0027s men and those of Momonosuke, still transformed into a dragon. Caesar Clown was writhing in pain, for Luffy had broken his nose with his violent punch! Mad with rage, the mad scientist forces Luffy to cease all action against him and to apologize on the spot, as he\u0027s no match for Doflamingo, who\u0027s running the show in the New World. Seeing that he is approaching and intends to attack him again, Caesar uses his powers to suppress Luffy by hurling a jet of flaming gas at him, but the latter is invulnerable to his attack. Seeing that he could do nothing against him, Clown warns his assailant that his friends and Law won\u0027t get out of Punk Hazard alive, but Luffy doesn\u0027t care and sends another right hook that explodes his opponent\u0027s jaw. Meanwhile, in Building C, where the SAD is milled, Trafalgar Law watches helplessly as Smoker battles Vergo. The two Navy Vice-Admirals are of equal strength, and each uses the Combative Fluid to fight. But Vergo proves the stronger, and Smoker is no match for his opponent\u0027s speed and strength. At the same time, Shinokuni continues to wreak havoc and floods into Caesar Clown\u0027s laboratory, forcing Zoro, still carrying Tashigi on his back, to run for his life. The children, now recovered and escorted by Nami, Robin, Sanji and the surviving members of the G-5 unit, do the same, while Chopper remains at Mocha\u0027s bedside, who is in bad shape after having ingested all of Caesar Clown\u0027s candy. The little girl suffers in agony as the little reindeer forces her to vomit up all the sweets she has swallowed, with the help of a few Smoker men who have come to support the Straw Hat Crew\u0027s ship\u0027s doctor in his action. As he does so, his comrades and the Navy survivors head for the second floor of Building R, where the last escape route from Shinokuni\u0027s deadly fumes lies. Nearby, Kinemon is still searching for his son. He dreads having mistakenly sliced Momonosuke, who had metamorphosed into a dragon, while Brook, clinging to his shoulders, implores him to turn back, as they run towards the deadly gases of Clown\u0027s weapon. For his part, Usopp hears voices coming from the other side of a heavy metal door. He thinks he\u0027ll find the handcuffs he\u0027s looking for, but when the door magically opens in front of him, he\u0027s discovered by Caesar\u0027s men, who try to apprehend him. Meanwhile, in Building C, Smoker and Vergo continue to fight, each using their own powers. Unfortunately, Tashigi\u0027s superior is quickly defeated by the power and speed of his opponent. Law, who has seen everything, tries to intervene, but Vergo, who has his heart, makes him suffer horribly by manipulating his organ. At the same moment, Smoker, in a half-coma, remembers his last conversation with his subordinate, and straightens up to face Vergo once again. But this burst of pride is quickly suppressed by Clown\u0027s henchman, who easily knocks Smoker down. This risky maneuver nevertheless enabled Law to recover his heart, which Smoker had managed to steal from under Vergo\u0027s nose. Now that the pirate had regained all his vigor, he was in a position to take on the felonious naval officer who had hidden a snail phone in one of his coat pockets. Thanks to this device, he was in constant conversation with Doflamingo, and Law told him that he was about to lose his right-hand man, Vergo. But Vergo had not said his last word. Completely covering his naked torso with Fluid, he attacks his opponent with rage. The latter, with a single stroke of his sword, sliced him in two before the astonished eyes of Smoker, who had been following the whole scene. The sword stroke also cut through the tanks of the SAD, the contents of which threaten to spill out onto the two combatants at any moment. As he completes his battle, Law nostalgically recalls the battle at the summit of Marineford two years earlier, and how the new era that began with the death of Whitebeard will be his and that of the other Supernovae scattered across the New World...",

        "description": "Trafalgar Law\u0027s blow to Vergo\u0027s sword has left the island of Punk Hazard dangerously weakened and beginning to collapse in on itself. As Shinokuni invades the corridors of Caesar Clown\u0027s laboratory, the children, accompanied by members of the Straw Hat Crew and the surviving soldiers of the G-5 unit, head for door R-66 in Building R, the only way out of Building B, whose walls are beginning to crack on all sides. Under the effect of Law\u0027s shaking, the deadly gases from Clown\u0027s weapon seep into the room where the survivors of the Punk Hazard Master\u0027s experiments are staying. Despite their desire to flee, the children are terrified and unable to move. At the same moment, Zoro, still carrying Tashigi on his shoulder, arrives at the Marine soldiers\u0027 side, who are delighted to find their leader alive. But their reunion is short-lived, as they all have to flee before the threatening advance of Shinokuni\u0027s deadly gas. At the same time, in Building C, ravaged by the blow of Law\u0027s sword, Law puts his weapon back in its scabbard, while Vergo, cut in two, lies miserably on the floor. The felonious naval officer is still alive, and asks his victor for the meaning of his words. But Trafalgar Law no longer cares for him. Vergo, using the last of his strength, attacks his opponent from behind. Law sees him and uses his powers to confront him. Not far away, on the second floor of Building B, in the examination room where Chopper is treating poor Mocha as best he can, the ceiling of the room begins to collapse on them. The Marine soldiers accompanying the little reindeer beg him to flee as quickly as possible. Chopper obeyed, forcing his companions to carry the little girl on their backs, who had fallen into a deep coma despite the perfusions keeping her alive. At the same time, Law has once again triumphed over Vergo, cutting every part of his body into tiny pieces and hanging each one on a railing next to a tank filled with SAD that is about to spill its entire contents. Smoker, witnessing the scene, gradually comes to his senses as the pirate begins to walk away from Building C, which is about to explode. As he leaves the room with Tashigi\u0027s superior, Vergo warns Law that he is no match for Don Quixote Doflamingo, who is much stronger than he is. The pirate silences him by slicing his face in two before bidding him farewell. At the same time, on the second floor of Building R, the ceiling of the room begins to collapse before the helpless eyes of Luffy, Momonosuke and Clown. The men in the latter\u0027s service are crushed to death by the boulders falling on them. The same situation occurs on the floor above where Usopp is. He manages to flee on all fours, leaving his pursuers in his wake. Drunk with anger, Caesar orders his men left in the control room to open the valves so that Shinokuni\u0027s gases can invade the room where their master is. The latter finally reveals his true face, calling his subordinates the scum of the earth. However, his men carry out his order, and soon the deadly vapors arrive on the outskirts of door R-66. Clown\u0027s henchmen, present at the scene, take fright at the sight of Shinokuni approaching them. Caesar, who has nothing to fear from this weapon since he himself is made of gas, holds out his hands to capture all Shinokuni\u0027s power. He then transforms into a terrifying gaseous monster that continues to grow before the eyes of Luffy and his friends. By becoming the \u0022King of the Land of Death\u0022, Clown fulfills his destiny and makes his own men the first victims of his power. His actions were observed by his subordinates in the control room. They soon realize that they are Clown\u0027s guinea pigs, and that they mean nothing to him. Seeing that there\u0027s nothing he can do for the moment, Luffy entrusts the still unconscious Brownbeard to Momonosuke before running to Building B where his friends are. Clown is stunned by his adversary\u0027s attitude and boasts as he continues to petrify his men beside him. Their comrades, present in the control room, once again witness their master\u0027s crimes. Usopp takes advantage of the situation to urge his enemies to join his trusted captain, who is not known for betraying his crew. The latter, using Gear Third, turns back and runs to confront Clown, who continues to petrify his men. Stretching out his arms as far as possible and inflating his handles while protecting them with Weapon Fluid, the Straw Hat then uses the \u0022Grizzly Magnum\u0022 technique to strike down his dangerous opponent. The struggle is terrible and soon his hands, which have touched Clown\u0027s vaporous ones, begin to harden and petrify. Luffy doesn\u0027t let this bother him, however, and with his fury, he violently defeats Caesar, sending him crashing through the R-66 door, which shatters on impact. The Master of Punk Hazard Island finds himself hurled down a long corridor before the impassive, hate-filled eyes of the young pirate...",

His dazzling feat is relayed by escagocamera to the four corners of the New World, where the various shadowy agents acting on behalf of the Four Emperors and Doflamingo witness Clown\u0027s debacle at the hands of the Straw Hat. At the same time, on the second floor of Building B, the ceiling is collapsing. Soldiers from the G-5 unit are running as fast as they can, carrying Mocha\u0027s lifeless body on their shoulders. Chopper is at the little girl\u0027s bedside, urging her to hold on. Suddenly, the little reindeer hears Usopp\u0027s voice in the control room, telling him the way out of Punk Hazard: Building R. He sees Nami on the control screens, guiding the children towards the exit. He urges her to keep running, as she and her group will soon have reached their destination. As he helps his companions, Usopp hears Caesar Clown\u0027s men wailing around him, still reeling from the shock of having been betrayed by their beloved master. As Chopper continues to do his best to heal Mocha, who has been lifted by Smoker\u0027s men, the Straw Hat Crew doctor spots Brook in the distance, carrying Kinemon\u0027s petrified body. The living skeleton explains that the samurai had been exposed to Shinokuni\u0027s deadly gas and had died as a result. Brook tells his friend exactly what happened: Kinemon learned from a little girl that her son had turned into a dragon. Mad with grief, the samurai ran into danger and turned into a statue without Brook being able to intervene. After these explanations, Usopp, still in the control room, warns Brook and Chopper that Shinokuni is getting dangerously close to them. The two members of the Straw Hat Crew catch sight of him and immediately flee. For her part, Nami encourages the giant children to follow her to Building R, which is now very close. Accompanied by Navy soldiers, Nami and the children enter the second floor of the building. The young sailor spots Luffy, but also Brownbeard, who lies unconscious beside her. Momonosuke, still transformed into a dragon, is delighted to find the children safe and sound. He then realizes that the Straw Hat had kept his word, telling him that he and his friends had promised to rescue Caesar Clown\u0027s unfortunate victims. Meanwhile, Sanji, Zoro and Robin arrive at Building R, but they\u0027re worried not to see Chopper and the others there. As everyone congratulates each other, Tashigi fails to see his superior safe and sound with Luffy and begins to panic. Meanwhile, in the passageway between Building R and Building D, Smoker and Law drag a heavy empty SAD wagon towards Door R-66, with the aim of getting everyone into it to escape from the laboratory. When the two men arrive in Building R, the Navy Vice-Admiral is hailed as a hero by his men, who are delighted to see him again. Trafalgar Law takes the opportunity to speak to Luffy, asking him where Clown is. The young pirate boasts that he has kicked his opponent\u0027s butt. This news greatly displeases Law, who reprimands him for having preferred to capture Caesar alive according to the plan they had both agreed upon. At the same time, as Shinokuni has completely invaded Buildings A and B, his deadly gases seep into the Biscuit Room, forcing Chopper, the Navy crew and Brook to run for their lives to avoid being petrified. Their only salvation is to reach Door R-66, where all their friends are already. Nami takes the opportunity to check on Brownbeard, who is still in a coma. Meanwhile, before the confrontation between Luffy and Caesar begins, two members of Don Quixote\u0027s crew Doflamingo approach Punk Hazard. The pretty Baby 5, who is still reeling from the death of her last fianc\u00e9, coldly murdered by her captain, and Buffalo, who uses his powers as a Roto Man to fly and carry his colleague through the air. He even manages to disperse Shinokuni\u0027s toxic clouds. Baby 5 then sees a strange armed ship with the name SAD. As they prepare to land, they hear a thud from the tanker: something had crashed into it, and that something was Caesar Clown, who had been knocked out by Luffy. Baby 5 and Buffalo can\u0027t believe their eyes. Luffy immediately informs Doflamingo, who had stayed behind in Dressrosa to oversee operations, by snail phone. He asks them to retrieve Caesar and bring him to him, which they do on the spot. Doflamingo wants to have Caesar Clown at his service, so that he can make as many SADs for him as he likes. As Law and his companions are about to take the exit taken by Clown, Baby 5 and Buffalo see a strange machine strolling quietly along the deck of the tanker where the master of Punk Hazard had crashed. It\u0027s Franky, transformed into a robot to face up to Shinokuni\u0027s toxic fumes, who is astonished to see these two strange individuals flying through the sky...",

        "description": "As Baby 5 and Buffalo continue to approach Punk Hazard, glaring at the robot-like Franky, the latter begins to attack them with machine-gun fire. The two members of Don Quixote\u0027s crew, Doflamingo, are taken aback by such an act and believe they are in the presence of one of Dr. Vegapunk\u0027s Pacifistas. But Baby 5 doesn\u0027t give up, and organizes a counter-attack with the help of his accomplice. Launched into the air by Buffalo, the young woman fires dozens of bursts at Franky until she succeeds in destroying him. Meanwhile, in Caesar Clown\u0027s third laboratory, located in Building R, Luffy, Nami, Zoro, Sanji, Robin, Brownbeard, Smoker, Tashigi and the surviving members of the G-5 unit help the children board the wagon that Law had wisely brought to escape the island, which is collapsing in on itself. While Luffy, Sanji and Zoro wait desperately for the return of Chopper, Brook and Mocha, who have not yet arrived, the pirate corsair, who knows the bowels of Punk Hazard very well, tells Nami that by taking Gate R-66 they will reach a port where a tanker is moored, despite the fact that Shinokuni\u0027s toxic fumes completely cover the island. This danger does not frighten the giant children, who are ready to do anything to return to their families. At the same time, Caesar lies unconscious in the harbor where the tanker is moored. Above him, Baby 5 and Buffalo plan to take him back to their captain as quickly as possible, but their plan is thwarted by the awakening of Franky, who was not destroyed according to the intuition of Doflamingo\u0027s ravishing subordinate. Astonished by such a turn of events, they realize, to their horror, that Franky\u0027s robotic body hadn\u0027t been scratched in the slightest. After this moment of surprise, the Straw Hat Crew\u0027s carpenter attacks Doflamingo\u0027s two accomplices again, throwing his shield at them like a boomerang. This fighting technique exasperates Baby 5, who abandons her bazooka to transform herself into a weapon using her own powers. Before Franky\u0027s stunned eyes, the young woman turns her upper body into a sharp blade, while Buffalo grabs one of her ankles to send her accomplice, now a giant sword, spinning through the air! Using his abilities as a Rotating Man, Buffalo attacks Franky. Franky defends himself by throwing his shield at them, which is sliced through in a single blow by Baby 5. Knowing that his duty is to protect the nearby Sunny at all costs, Franky has no choice but to pull out his katana to fight his two attackers. He manages to rout them by strafing them again. But Baby 5 has not said her last word and turns into a missile woman. With Buffalo\u0027s help, she is sent to Franky. Despite his best efforts to detonate the dangerous projectile in mid-air, Luffy\u0027s friend is powerless to stop Baby 5, who wreaks havoc on the tanker\u0027s deck before Bufallo\u0027s satisfied eyes. As the snow begins to fall again, Caesar Clown comes to. He\u0027s disoriented and finds he can\u0027t move as if paralyzed. Thinking that all was lost for him, he hears a suspicious noise and notices that he was still carrying Vice-Admiral Smoker\u0027s beating heart, which Law had managed to seize. Moved by a nagging grudge, Clown is ready to take Smoker with him to hell, approaching a long stone spike so that the rest of his companions who are with him sink into utter disarray. At the same moment, in Building R, the door leading to the room where Luffy and his friends are staying begins to close before the frightened eyes of the giant children. Suddenly, one of them sees the devastating scent of Shinokuni approaching them. At this announcement, the Navy soldiers take fright and begin to climb in disorder aboard the SAD wagon where the children are already. Yet Luffy and his companions remain unmoved, unmoved by the danger unfolding before them. This astonishes Law, who doesn\u0027t understand their motivation. Luffy explains that they\u0027re not all there. In the passageway between Buildings B and R, Chopper and his group are still running from the toxic fumes of Clown\u0027s weapon of mass destruction. For his part, Usopp, still ensconced in the control room on the second floor of Building R, is doing his best to help his companions reach the room at Door R-66, where they will finally be safe. Caesar\u0027s former subordinates rally around Usopp after giving him the Sea Granite handcuffs he\u0027d come for. Not far away, Chopper, Mocha, Brook and the rest of Smoker\u0027s men run breathlessly to join the rest of their companions, who are waiting for them before the door that leads to them closes completely in front of them. Despite the rockslides and toxic fumes of Shinokuni, Chopper and his men manage to reach Gate R-66 in extremis, just as the other gate closes behind them to the cheers and relief of their friends. But time is running out, and Law brings them violently back to reality, urging them to board the wagon as quickly as possible. Usopp, who has joined the others, obeys while Brook shows them Kinemon\u0027s petrified body. Upon hearing his father\u0027s name, Momonosuke, still transformed into a dragon, can\u0027t help crying. Far away, in Dressrosa, Doflamingo receives an urgent call by snail phone. It\u0027s from Mone, who\u0027s still alive even after receiving Zoro\u0027s coup de gr\u00e2ce. The young harpy, covered in blood, learns from \u0022Joker\u0022 that Vergo and Caesar had failed in their mission and that Baby 5 and Buffalo had been ordered to bring the former Master of Punk Hazard back to him. Yet Doflamingo\u0027s greatest desire is to see the giant children who witnessed his failure perish. The latter, accompanied by Luffy, speed down the corridor that Clown had previously travelled down in their wagon. As they flee, Doflamingo confesses to Mone that there is another weapon responsible for the destruction of Vegapunk\u0027s first and second laboratories. It\u0027s the same weapon that ravaged the island of Pink Hazard 4 years ago. By activating this weapon at the touch of a button, only one person can survive this cataclysm, and that person is none other than Caesar Clown himself, since he\u0027s made entirely of gas. Mone, aware of the danger, stands precisely in front of the triggering device and is ready to sacrifice herself so that the tanker that was to be used by the escapees can also be destroyed. Accepting her fate, the young woman lifts the hood where the release button was hidden, while Caesar Clown, rejuvenated by his revenge, is ready to pierce Smoker\u0027s beating heart. As Doflamingo bids farewell to Vergo, whose head, dismembered from the rest of his body, is still cut in two, La Femme-Neige, in a last gasp of life and as everyone flees the island, which is on the verge of collapse, presses the destruct button while making a solemn vow that Doflamingo will one day become the Pirate King! As she does so, a huge explosion rocks the mountain, which is completely pulverized by the blast...\n",

        "description": "As everything crumbles around her, Mone prepares to press the bomb\u0027s release button. Meanwhile, Luffy and his comrades are speeding along the road to freedom in the wagon Law commandeered to escape Punk Hazard. Smoker and Tashigi are with the children and surviving members of the G-5 unit. While they\u0027re riding, Brook has a run-in with Momonosuke, still metamorphosed into a dragon, who is desperate to retrieve Kinemon\u0027s petrified body. He screams in pain as he recognizes his father\u0027s face, before the astonished eyes of the various members of the Straw Hat Crew. Not far away, outside the tunnel, as Buffalo quietly hovers over Franky\u0027s burnt body, Caesar Clown is at the height of his triumph: he was about to take Smoker with him to the grave by stabbing the Vice-Admiral\u0027s heart that Law had given him. At the same time, Mone was about to press the self-destruct button, thinking of the escapees trying to get away from Punk Hazard as quickly as possible. It was all in vain for them, since they were going to die at the same time as the harpy-woman for the sake of Don Quixote Doflamingo, who was quietly waiting in Dressrosa for the fateful moment of his sacrifice. A sacrifice that never comes, as Mone feels a violent pain in her chest. His young master, bored with waiting for Punk Hazard to be destroyed, can\u0027t understand why Mone\u0027s snail phone is still active. As everything collapses inside Clown\u0027s laboratory, Chopper does his best to comfort the children, who are afraid of landslides. Suddenly, a violent explosion is heard and Trafalgar Law explains to his companions that Building D, where SAD was manufactured, has just exploded. At the same moment, Mone struggles to press the release button, but her strength fails her and she collapses, while Doflamingo begs her to destroy everything and Caesar Clown, drunk with rage, stabs Smoker in the heart. Not far away, in the tunnel leading to the port of Punk Hazard, Smoker chats with Law, thanking him for returning his heart, which the privateer pirate had taken on Clown\u0027s orders. In a clever bit of sleight-of-hand, Law had given Caesar Mone\u0027s heart, making him believe it was Smoker\u0027s. His ruse had worked so well, he\u0027d had to give it back. His ruse worked so well that the Master of Punk Hazard boasted that he had in his possession the heart of the Navy Vice-Admiral! So by stabbing this organ, he had not murdered Smoker but his pretty secretary by mistake, much to the chagrin of Doflamingo, who wanted the Snow Woman to carry out her plans by destroying Punk Hazard. Outside, Baby 5 returns to her human form after overcoming Franky\u0027s robotic body. She\u0027s pleased with her work, without knowing that the Iron Pirate was still alive. The latter lets her know it by trying to crush the young woman with his fists. But Baby 5 has not said his last word. After trying to shoot him by turning into a Woman-Revolver, she gets help from her colleague Buffalo, who throws his lucky bazooka at her. The young woman aims at Franky and fires. A huge explosion ripples across the deck of the tanker that was to be the Punk Hazard survivors\u0027 ticket out. The survivors, led by Luffy, are still aboard the SAD wagon, speeding towards the exit. But the tunnel walls begin to collapse in on them. Blocks of stone crumble in their path, but Straw Hat\u0027s initiative and Zoro\u0027s fencing skills quickly get them out of this predicament. Despite this feat, the survivors are not out of the woods yet, as Shinokuni\u0027s toxic vapors, which have responded through the cracks in the collapsing tunnel, come dangerously close to them. What\u0027s more, once they reach the open air, Law knows they\u0027ll be exposed to the gases of Caesar Clown\u0027s weapon of mass destruction, which now envelops every corner of Punk Hazard. The only way to protect themselves is to create wind to disperse its dangerous clouds. Nami, who is well-versed in meteorological matters, immediately offers her help, while a distraught Usopp suddenly spots the tunnel exit. This worry doesn\u0027t bother Luffy, who can\u0027t wait to see the sun again. Meanwhile, back at Dressrosa, Doflamingo is getting impatient and wonders if Mone has carried out his order. So he decides to make his own way to Punk Hazard, flying through the air using his levitation powers without warning his loved ones, Jora and Lao G, who have remained on his island. As he flies over the sea, Doflamingo asks Buffalo, via snail phone, about his situation on Punk Hazard, having realized that not all its inhabitants had been exterminated. His crew member explains that he and Baby 5 are having trouble with an iron guard blocking their passage. Doflamingo orders him to take care of him, while assuring him that he was on his way to finish off the late Monee\u0027s work.\n",

        "description": "On the coast of Punk Hazard, Baby 5 continues to fire at Franky\u0027s robotic body, which doesn\u0027t shrink from his assaults. On the contrary, he continues to advance, even throwing his assailant\u0027s own projectiles at him! The young woman has not said her last word and angrily strafes her impetuous adversary. But her attacks have no effect on Franky, who boasts to her that he is the \u0022invincible Iron Pirate\u0022. This is too much for Baby 5, who counters with the help of Buffalo. Using his powers to slash and shoot flames at Franky, Don Quixote\u0027s crew member Doflamingo thinks he\u0027s won the game, but he\u0027s no match for the pugnacious carpenter from the Straw Hat Crew, who rises to his feet without a scratch. He even invites the Man-Whisper and the Woman-Woman to come and challenge him. Meanwhile, in the tunnel leading to Punk Hazard harbor, where the tanker is moored, the SAD wagon carrying Luffy and his companions continues to speed towards the exit. But the deadly gases of Shinokuni are hot on their heels. What\u0027s more, the tunnel they\u0027re travelling through could collapse on them at any moment. To avoid this, the surviving members of the G-5 unit and Caesar Clown\u0027s former men do their best to protect the children from injury in the landslide. As they do so, everyone watches Nami, who is the only person capable of generating enough wind to disperse the toxic fumes from Clown\u0027s weapon. Continuing to roll, Luffy destroys the boulders threatening to fall on his comrades while watching his friend. Not far away, Buffalo glares at Franky, who believes his two attackers are interested in his cola, even though they had come to the island to take Caesar Clown to their master. Launching a joint attack, Baby 5 manages to perforate Franky\u0027s robotic left arm after metamorphosing into a Sickle Woman. But her triumph is short-lived, as Franky seizes the Buffalo chains he had attached to the young woman\u0027s wrists and launches them into the air, demonstrating his new Gaon cannon weapon: the General Cannon! At the same time, in the tunnel, the situation is becoming desperate for the survivors of Punk Hazard: four Navy soldiers have almost lost their lives after being thrown from the wagon carrying them. They are saved in extremis by the giant children, while the Shinokuni vapors continue to pursue them. Outside, Franky savors his triumph: his new weapon has worked extremely well. Suddenly, he sees the lifeless body of Caesar below and wonders how the Master of Punk Hazard managed to get here. At the same moment, Baby 5 and Buffalo rise to their feet and are more determined than ever: they\u0027re going to get Caesar back, whatever it takes. Nearby, the wagon carrying Luffy and his friends soon reaches the exit. But they are still being pursued by Shinokuni. They see, to their horror, that more toxic clouds are blocking the exit! Sandwiched by this new threat, the giant children plead with Nami to do something to save them. Remembering the promise she made in the Chamber of Biscuits, the young navigator pulls out her climate stick and produces a wind strong enough to clear a path through the air. Meanwhile, Baby 5 steps in front of Franky to retrieve Caesar at the risk of losing her life. She is soon joined by Buffalo, who is also determined to finish Franky off. Suddenly, a thud is heard: the wind produced by Nami has had its effect and the SAD carriage with all its passengers has managed to get out of the tunnel, dispersing the dangerous Shinokuni fumes around it, before the astonished eyes of the two members of the Joker\u0027s Crew. They see Luffy and his companions\u0027 improvised means of transport braking in front of them before it derails. The passengers are delighted to see the sun again, and thank Nami for saving their lives. Franky is also happy to see his friends safe and sound, and calls out to them from the top of the tanker. Luffy, Usopp and Chopper are delighted to see General Franky in all his glory, as are Smoker\u0027s men, but Nami, Robin, Tashigi and the giant girls are less thrilled. Suddenly, Law sees Buffalo ahead of him and recognizes the pretty Baby 5, both in the service of the mysterious Joker. The latter also notice him and call the privateer pirate a traitor, since he had turned against Doflamingo by forming an alliance with the Straw Hat. Knowing who his real enemies were, Luffy and his friends notice that Baby 5 and Buffalo had fled, taking Caesar Clown with them. Usopp and Nami take it upon themselves to capture them. The young navigator, gifted in the art of meteorology, creates a storm cloud that blasts the fugitives, who fall like stones. Usopp then takes over, using his kabuto to launch a rather special projectile containing stones to stun Buffalo and Sea Granite handcuffs to neutralize Clown\u0027s gaseous powers. The three escapees then fall into the sea to the cheers of the Punk Hazard survivors, who are stunned by Usopp\u0027s sniper skills. Trafalgar Law is relieved and satisfied that his new allies have finally captured this dangerous scientist. Not far away, Doflamingo continues to fly towards Caesar\u0027s island. Nothing and no one can divert him from his course. At the same time, a mysterious individual on a giant penguin wonders where Punk Hazard is...",

        "title": "An emotional reunion! Momonosuke and Kinemon",
        "description": "In the port of Punk Hazard, the men of the G-5 unit use black paint to demarcate a border between themselves and the Straw Hat pirates, and are strictly forbidden to cross it. This is against the advice of their superior, who considers their action childish and does not want his subordinates to sympathize with the pirates, who are their mortal enemies. Vice-Admiral Smoker then tells them that he has contacted the G-5 base, and that he and his men should wait quietly on the island for help. Meanwhile, Luffy chats with Brownbeard, who is now in fine form despite the Sea Granite handcuffs around his wrists. The pirate deliberately surrendered to the Navy in order to benefit from medical treatment that would completely eliminate the effects of the drug injected into him by Caesar. Brownbeard is delighted that the Straw Hat has been able to stop the mad scientist, who is tied up and half-frozen alongside Buffalo and the pretty Baby 5, who had come to take him with them to their captain, Don Quixote Doflamingo. For their part, Sanji and Brook are gathering bricks to build a huge stove that the Straw Hat cook will use to make delicious meals. This prospect delights the living skeleton, who is soon distressed to see Kinemon\u0027s petrified, lifeless body. Not far away, Usopp, with the sound of his whistle and the help of the surviving G-5 soldiers, coordinates the restoration of the tanker\u0027s mast, which had suffered as a result of Franky\u0027s violent confrontation with the two members of Doflamingo\u0027s crew. On deck, Nami is shocked to learn from Tashigi that the children will be handed over to the care of the Navy. This news doesn\u0027t please the young sailor, who had hoped to bring the children back safely to their parents. But Tashigi apologizes on the spot and promises Nami that she will help Mocha and his friends to recover, and that once they have fully recovered, they will be reunited with their loved ones. Not far away, Chopper explores a secret room in the tanker and, piqued by curiosity, enters despite Law\u0027s prohibition that the place is too dangerous. The little reindeer pushed open the door and screamed in terror when he saw what was inside. Scurrying away, he tells all his friends that Trafalgar Law is a murderer. Brook listens to Chopper and unintentionally knocks over the Kinemon statue, which shatters at his feet. The living skeleton quickly understands his blunder, which he immediately shares with Sanji and Luffy, who judge him very harshly. But this event is salutary, as the samurai everyone thought dead was in fact alive. This prodigy astounds the Straw Hats, as well as Smoker\u0027s soldiers and Momonosuke, who magically becomes human again. Luffy and his friends witness a tender and moving reunion between father and son, without the latter noticing that he is completely naked! Kinemon sees this detail and, thanks to his power, gives Momonosuke a superb kimono, which he suddenly collapses in front of. He confesses that he\u0027s starving and hadn\u0027t eaten for days. Meanwhile, Chopper returns to the mysterious room where Law is hiding. He orders him to come out and explain what he\u0027s done to the giant children. The privateer pirate calmly emerges from the room and coldly tells him that he has sliced them to pieces. Panicked, the little reindeer enters the room and notices that all Caesar Clown\u0027s former victims are in very good health. They tell him that Law simply removed the diseased parts of their bodies, and that it\u0027s thanks to him that they\u0027re doing so much better. Chopper seems relieved by this news, but worries that Mocha has not yet regained consciousness. His comrades had understood what role their friend had played and hoped with all their hearts to see the little girl recover quickly. They also remembered Nami\u0027s promise, but were saddened by Tashigi\u0027s unexpected arrival. Indeed, Smoker\u0027s second-in-command tells them that they are now under the responsibility of the Navy, a prospect they are not very happy about. Above them, Usopp savors the appetizing aroma of the dish Sanji is preparing and watches Franky, who is repositioning the tanker\u0027s mast with the help of the G-5 men. Suddenly, Usopp notices Nami pensively leaning against the rail. He approaches her and the young woman explains, without taking her eyes off the sea, that from now on the Navy will take care of the giant children. It\u0027s a wise decision, especially as Nami has great confidence in the female soldiers. Moreover, Belmer, her adoptive mother, was a respected former Navy officer, a strong argument for leaving Mocha and her friends in the care of Tashigi, who had promised her she would take good care of them. On the harbor, Sanji put the finishing touches to the dish he had prepared, totally inspired by the roborative cuisine of Emporio Ivankov, the \u0022queen\u0022 of the Okama. The Straw Hat cook holds up a bowl of piping-hot soup in front of Momonosuke, who stubbornly refuses to taste it. This attitude displeases Sanji, who is not pleased to see someone wasting food in front of him. But Kinemon sets an example by enjoying the other dishes Sanji has prepared, while assuring his son that he can trust the pirates who saved his life. Feeling weakened, Momonosuke finally agrees to eat the soup offered by Sanji, before moving on to other equally succulent dishes, much to the delight of Luffy, who doesn\u0027t miss a moment of the spectacle. The giant children, who were Momonosuke\u0027s companions in misfortune, gather, bowl in hand, in front of Sanji\u0027s cauldron to get something to eat too. Trafalgar Law, however, is not in the mood to celebrate, and talks to Luffy to ask his men to leave Punk Hazard immediately, as someone was after them. But the Straw Hat has his own way and prefers to continue partying and drinking sake with Zoro and Usopp, much to Law\u0027s dismay, who doesn\u0027t understand the young pirate\u0027s flippant attitude. However, only one member of the Straw Hat Crew is not in the mood to celebrate. This is Chopper, who is standing by the bedside of Mocha, who has not yet woken up. The little reindeer still remembers the sacrifice the little girl had made by swallowing all Caesar Clown\u0027s candy at the risk of dying. But suddenly, Mocha opens his eyes and sees Chopper crying. Chopper is overjoyed that his friend is finally cured and throws himself around his neck. Not far away, outside, the Punk Hazard Master\u0027s former accomplices are happily toasting alongside Luffy\u0027s navy soldiers and pirates. Law is silently observing the scene when he is pestered by Chopper and Mocha, who, fully recovered, thanks him with a bowl of soup. For their part, the surviving members of the G-5 beg their commander to return to the island to save their still-petrified comrades, since they now know the weak point of Shinokuni, Caesar Clown\u0027s secret weapon. The latter, swallowing his bitterness, doesn\u0027t understand how Smoker can still be alive. Far from these considerations, the Navy Vice-Admiral chats quietly with Trafalgar Law, who wistfully recalls his conversation with Luffy on the mountain. That conversation had taught him that the Straw Hat had a crazy plan to defeat the Four Emperors, who rule the New World unchallenged...\n",

        "description": "While the victory banquet is in full swing on the port of Punk Hazard, Smoker takes advantage of this moment of respite to have a quiet chat with Trafalgar Law, who confides in him that he had a discussion with Luffy on the mountain about the Four Emperors who rule the New World. Law was surprised by the Straw Hat\u0027s casual attitude: he seems to have no fear of these four dangerous individuals, who have acquired far greater territories than those once held by Whitebeard. Better still, Luffy is ready to join forces with Trafalgar Law to defeat the Four Emperors. In any case, the privateer pirate intends to use Luffy and his crew for his own ends. Not far away, during the banquet, the children play nicely with the surviving members of the G-5 unit, who try to lift them despite their enormous weight. All ends happily, as does Luffy, who wants to show everyone that he\u0027s the biggest eater on the island! While everyone is feasting and having fun, Law approaches the three prisoners that Nami and Usopp had managed to capture. He stares longingly at Caesar Clown, while Buffalo and the beautiful Baby 5 recognize him. For his part, Franky has completed the restoration of the tanker, which is now ready to welcome all its passengers. The crew of the Chapeau de Paille have no intention of using it, and ask Smoker to care for and return the giant children to their family. The Navy Vice-Admiral vows to do so, while the former guinea pigs happily board the ship. Once all the children are on board the tanker, the soldiers of the G-5 unit violently oppose the Straw Hats, painting a line on the ground in black paint with formal orders not to cross it. Still remembering the meal they had so heartily shared with them, Smoker\u0027s men hadn\u0027t forgotten who Luffy and his friends really were: pirates whose mere sight could shock a child! So they put up banners emblazoned with the Navy\u0027s sigil to try and hide the pirates from Mocha and his comrades, while chanting pro-Navy slogans and insulting pirates, who are treated like the dregs of humanity. This attitude greatly displeases the giant children, who cry their eyes out and can\u0027t even thank Luffy and his crew for saving their lives without a moment\u0027s thought for their own. On the ship, Tashigi, who has witnessed this scene, orders his men to stop their antics and behave like the worthy members of the Navy they\u0027ve forgotten to be by acting this way. The surviving members of the G-5 unit weep with emotion at their superior\u0027s words, explaining that they were afraid of becoming outlaws by sympathizing with pirates. This admission astonishes everyone, including Momonosuke and his father, who can\u0027t believe their ears. The incident ends with harmony restored and the mischievous laughter of Tashigi, who is delighted to command such men. At last it\u0027s time to leave, and the tanker carrying the giant children and a few escorting Navy personnel quietly leaves the snowy port of Punk Hazard. Clown\u0027s former guinea pigs bid a heart-rending farewell to their saviors and promise them, much to the chagrin of the G-5 men left on the island, that they too will become pirates when they grow up. Luffy and his companions laugh heartily, wishing them a safe journey, a speedy recovery and a speedy return home to their parents. Once their ship has sailed, the Crew of the Straw Hat also intend to leave Punk Hazard as quickly as possible, taking Trafalgar Law with them - much to the astonishment of Zoro, who was unaware of Luffy\u0027s recent pirate alliance with the leader of the Heart Crew. Everyone returns to the Thousand Sunny, which is ready for departure, including Momonosuke and Kinemon, who are on board. Franky takes his place at the helm, quietly awaiting orders from his captain, who takes a long look at the horizon. All aboard the Sunny have fond memories of everything that happened on Punk Hazard and their fierce battle with Caesar Clown. The latter is also aboard the Straw Hat ship, chained and closely watched by Trafalgar Law. As Luffy gives the starting signal and his ship leaves the desolate shores of Punk Hazard for good, Doflamingo continues to fly through the air, determined to reach Caesar\u0027s island whatever the cost. On his way, he spots a boat sailing nearby. It turns out to be the lifeboat of his own tanker. He lands on it and notices that on board are the heads of his two subordinates who were to bring him the mad scientist, as well as a trendy snail phone whose face looks exactly like Trafalgar Law! Baby 5 and Buffalo confess their failure to their master, who receives a communication from Law. Law is delighted that Doflamingo has deigned to show his face outside his lair, and explains that Caesar is with him. He wants to negotiate with Doflamingo, but Doflamingo laughs and tells him he\u0027s no match for him. However, Law has more than one trick up his sleeve, reminding him not to upset Kaidou, the King of the Hundred Beasts, who is one of the Four Emperors and would not be very happy to learn that Doflamingo can no longer produce Smile for him. He\u0027d definitely kill him if he heard the news. To avoid such an outcome, Doflamingo asks Law what he wants in exchange for Caesar, and the pirate\u0027s answer is not long in coming. All he wants is for his worst enemy to get rid of his Corsair title, so that he can go back to being just another pirate. Law also blackmails him, demanding that Doflamingo\u0027s resignation from the police force be made known in the next day\u0027s paper. This ultimatum provokes the wrath of the Master of Dressrosa, who curses Trafalgar Law\u0027s name in front of Buffalo and Baby 5\u0027s faces.",

        "description": "As the Thousand Sunny sails through calm, untroubled seas, all the members of the Chapeau de Paille crew are delighted to have finally left the horrible island of Punk Hazard. Everyone is enjoying the fine weather and going about their business. Chopper takes the opportunity to treat Caesar Clown\u0027s wounds, although his heart is not in it, while Franky drinks a whole bottle of wine without stopping. He takes the opportunity to tell his friend Brook what he\u0027d done after escaping from the cage where he was trapped with Luffy. Using his thrusters to lift himself into the air, he spotted Sunny\u0027s hideout and decided to move away from the shores of Punk Hazard when he heard the detonation Smiley had produced as he transformed into Shinokuni. Gaining the open sea quickly, Franky took the opportunity to go to the other side of the island to retrieve the Mini Merry II moored there, before returning to the port of Punk Hazard, where he had donned General Franky\u0027s armor, which is capable of withstanding the toxic fumes of Caesar\u0027s weapon. Brook was delighted to hear his story. He was drinking tea when he was pestered by Kinemon and Momonosuke, who are also on the trip. Father and son also want to taste Brook\u0027s tea. Brook is quick to oblige and clutches two cups, which they drink with pleasure. After this convivial moment, Kinemon explains to his new friends that he and his son intend to sail to the next harbor island that the Sunny passes. They could have left on the tanker carrying the children, but they didn\u0027t want to stay with the navy soldiers, as Kinemon and Momonosuke had to continue a journey vital to their own lives. So they asked Luffy\u0027s permission to stay on board until the next port of call. The Straw Hat enthusiastically welcomed them, as did the rest of her crew. Trafalgar Law, who also accompanies them, announces their next destination: Dressrosa, the lair of the horrible Don Quixote Doflamingo. At the same time, in Punk Hazard, Caesar Clown\u0027s former subordinates lend their suits to the surviving members of the G-5 unit, so that they can rescue their petrified comrades, still alive, who are still trapped under the rubble of Doctor Vegapunk\u0027s former laboratories. They explain that these suits are able to withstand Shinokuni\u0027s toxic fumes; and it was knowing this that their former master had asked them to take them off when Smiley exploded. He wanted to see what effect his new weapon would have on human beings! With these suits on, Smoker\u0027s men enter the ruins of Clown\u0027s old lair to rescue their missing companions. At the same time, Brownbeard, who has also donned a protective suit in his size, is pleased to have received permission to remain on the island to save the lives of his crew, who have been trapped by Caesar Clown. He tells Smoker, who remains impassive, and watches him leave in the tunnel that had previously been used for their escape. After the pirate has left, the Vice-Admiral notices a commotion coming from the port of Punk Hazard, where the decapitated bodies of Buffalo and Baby 5 are on display. Suddenly, Smoker\u0027s men see strange glimmers in the sky, and soon the heads of the two pirates are back in place as if nothing had happened. Suddenly, a third figure appears, causing terror among the soldiers of the G-5 unit. It was Doflamingo, who made his entrance by twirling his coat of pink feathers in the wind before Smoker\u0027s astonished eyes. Martyrizing his soldiers with the Haki of Kings, Doflamingo wants to know where Trafalgar Law and the Straw Hats are right now. The Corsair\u0027s cruelty is unparalleled, and he tries to pull the wool over the eyes of one of the soldiers. Smoker dislikes this method and lets him know by throwing one of his famous steamy punches. He then proudly stands up to Doflamingo, who seems to be taunting him. The Vice-Admiral, aware of Law\u0027s next destination, doesn\u0027t breathe a word to his adversary. Soon, a Manichean battle ensues between the two men, with Smoker and Doflamingo clashing in the air without holding back their blows. But Smoker is no match for such an assailant, who is about to give him the final blow. The men of the G-5 unit, loyal to their leader, try to come to his aid. But Smoker intervenes, preventing them from doing anything for him. At his wits\u0027 end, he is finally defeated by Doflamingo, who uses the power of the Fluid to overcome his adversary before the helpless eyes of the G-5 men. Meanwhile, on the Thousand Sunny, Luffy is intrigued by Law\u0027s decision to set sail for Dressrosa. The privateer pirate explains that he has important business to do on the island. Dressrosa is also the destination of Kinemon and his son. Nami suddenly notices that their boat is caught in the current. Law is quick to tell her not to fight it and to let herself be guided to their next destination. Robin takes advantage of this moment to let his friends know that Trafalgar Law had been communicating with someone by snail phone. The privateer makes no secret of the fact, and even mentions the name of the person he\u0027s speaking to, much to the dismay of Usopp, who shudders at the mere mention of Doflamingo\u0027s name. Law reassured him that this was the logical continuation of his plan, a plan that the Straw Hat crew, with the exception of Luffy, were unaware of. Trafalgar Law and the Straw Hat\u0027s plan is simply to form a pirate alliance to kill one of the Four Emperors. An ambition that confuses Luffy\u0027s companions. But Caesar Clown, who is keeping out of the way, warns his captors that they will soon be hunted down by powerful people. Sanji silences him with a violent kick that leaves the former Master of Punk Hazard knocked out. After this incident, Law explains to his new allies the content of the alliance: while Luffy and his friends had captured Caesar Clown on the island, Law had taken the opportunity to destroy the machine that produced a substance called SAD, essential to the ambitions of the shadowy pirates who swarm the New World. Law also explains that Doflamingo is the most powerful of them all, and that his main associate is none other than Kaidou, one of the Four Emperors, who is the person to be killed. Meanwhile, on Punk Hazard, the severely wounded Smoker is dying in front of his men. Doflamingo is about to finish him off when he is bothered by Aokiji, who has come to Smoker\u0027s aid because he is his friend...\n",

        "description": "While Smoker is at the mercy of Don Quixote Doflamingo, Aokiji appears. Aokiji asks the pirate to spare his friend\u0027s life, but Smoker refuses. Just as Doflamingo was about to deliver the coup de gr\u00e2ce, former Admiral Aokiji uses his powers to freeze Smoker\u0027s attacker. His blow is so lightning-fast that it stuns the soldiers of the G-5 unit, who are left stunned. Buffalo and Baby 5 can do nothing about it, and soon see their beloved captain transformed into a magnificent statue of ice! But Doflamingo is no pushover, and quickly breaks free of his icy shroud to face the former Navy Admiral with a smile on his face. As the soldiers look on in panic, the pirate steps in front of Aokiji, but instead of fighting him, he continues to advance as if nothing had happened towards his two subordinates, who are reassured to see him alive again. Before Doflamingo rides off on Buffalo\u0027s back with the pretty Baby 5, he asks Kuzan about his current status. He received no answer from him, other than a long silence that spoke volumes. After the pirate leaves, Aokiji orders Smoker\u0027s men to treat their leader immediately. While Doflamingo savors his departure from Punk Hazard, Kuzan is at the bedside of his friend, who is in very bad shape following his fight with the Corsair Captain. He tells him to beware of the Corsair Captain, who is an evil man. Reassuring him that he hadn\u0027t changed since leaving the Navy, Aokiji took leave of his former colleague after ordering the G-5 men to keep the interview a secret. Climbing back on his giant penguin, Kuzan in turn leaves Punk Hazard. Meanwhile, aboard the Thousand Sunny, Trafalgar Law tells his new allies about Doflamingo and his association with Kaidou, one of the Four Emperors. At the mention of this name, Kinemon and his son lose their legendary composure to such an extent that Momonosuke transforms back into a dragon, much to the dismay of his father, who no longer recognizes him. Law continues his explanations. He tells Luffy and his friends that Emperor Kaidou is a great consumer of artificial Demon Fruit, which Doflamingo continually delivers to him in order to increase the number of special-power users among his own crew. Thanks to this, Kaidou increases his power vis-\u00e0-vis the other Emperors who rule the New World unchallenged. But Trafalgar Law has a plan to thwart Kaidou\u0027s plans, and it begins with the capture of Caesar Clown on Punk Hazard, as she is the only one capable of manufacturing SAD, the substance that enables the creation of artificial Demon Fruit. If there was a factory on Punk Hazard, there\u0027s another hiding on Dressrosa. The privateer pirate is determined to find it and destroy it in turn. Law knows in advance that this is a risky business, as Kaidou won\u0027t be so easily taken advantage of. Dressrosa is also the destination of Kinemon and Momonosuke, where one of their own is being held prisoner. As he spoke, the samurai noticed that the sky was darkening and hail was beginning to fall on them. Realizing that this phenomenon was not normal, Nami immediately climbed to the top of one of the Sunny\u0027s masts after ordering Franky to prepare a Burst Blow of which he had the secret. The Straw Hat Crew soon see huge blocks of ice falling on them. As Usopp aims for a cloudless area of the sea, Luffy\u0027s ship flies through the air to the astonishment of Kinemon and his son, who can\u0027t believe their eyes. After this prodigy, Momonosuke is transformed back into a little boy as if nothing had happened, while Franky emerges from the bowels of the Sunny, extolling the virtues of the boat he had built himself. Momonosuke and his father are delighted to be on board, and Nami takes the opportunity to ask the little samurai if he\u0027d like to visit the Thousand Sunny. The little boy gladly accepts the invitation. The young sailor takes him on a tour of the ship\u0027s nooks and crannies and all its riches: a superb aquarium housing many species of fish, and Robin\u0027s library containing numerous books on the New World. After enjoying a delicious meal in Sanji\u0027s kitchen, Momonosuke is examined by Chopper, who confirms that he is in good health. As the sun sets and night begins to fall, the Sunny sails quietly on calm waters, all aboard ready to give Doflamingo the welcome he deserves. Suddenly, Kinemon loses his head and attacks Zoro with his flaming sword, calling him a thief because he noticed Shuusui, Ryuma\u0027s famous sword, on the swordsman\u0027s belt. Caesar Clown, who witnessed the scene, took fright, but everything returned to normal when Sanji announced to the crew that he had prepared pizzas. Kinemon, who had never eaten pizza before, was eager to try it. He suddenly notices Momonosuke\u0027s absence. Nami informs them that the little boy is taking a bath with Robin. Knowing this, Kinemon, Sanji and Brook jump out of their seats and immediately head for Sunny\u0027s bathroom, where they see Momonosuke emerging in the arms of the charming archaeologist, who was dressed only in a towel. The three men were immediately enraged to see that Momonosuke was taking advantage of Robin\u0027s kindness to the point of making the little boy cry. Nami, who had arrived just then, sets the record straight by correcting the three adults, much to the relief of Momonosuke, who immediately snuggles between the young sailor\u0027s soft breasts and calls her a princess. Caught under her spell, Nami invites Kinemon\u0027s son to spend the night in the girls\u0027 room, even though this room was originally strictly forbidden to men. Despite this incident, the Sunny continues on its way when suddenly a strange creature emerges from the waves ahead of Chapeau de Paille\u0027s ship. A mysterious individual is on its back. He announces by snail phone that he has finally found Caesar Clown...\n",

Without hesitation, Luffy sets off for the burning island, with Vice Admiral Smoker on his tail. Supposedly a ruined and deserted island, the Straw Hats soon learn that they are not alone, encountering many new and old enemies as they explore the island. Punk Hazard is the first island the Straw Hats find in the New World, and is made up of ice lands on one side and fire lands on the other. The island also contains Dr. Vegapunk\u0027s abandoned research center, now used by Caesar Clown (a scientist of extreme cruelty) to produce SAD, an essential ingredient in the creation of Smiles (artificial demon fruits). Trafalgar Law and Luffy form an alliance to capture Caesar, and in the process attack the Grand Corsair Don Quijote Doflamingo. Doflamingo is an ally of Emperor Kaido, who is the real target of this alliance.",

        "description": "All the passengers on board the Thousand Sunny are fast asleep, including Caesar Clown, who is handcuffed on the ship\u0027s deck with Trafalgar Law. Only Usopp, Chopper and Franky are awake, watching the horizon for a possible attack from Don Quixote Doflamingo. As clouds obscure the moon, causing total darkness, the mysterious man riding the Kung-Fu Dugong decides to put his plan into action. Luminous balls fall from the sky onto our heroes\u0027 ship. The heroes, in a panic, don\u0027t know what\u0027s happening. Suddenly, the balls of light spring into action and start attacking Luffy and his friends. It\u0027s all a ruse, however, as the mysterious intruders magically disappear, to be replaced by an evil man called Breed, who has been perched on top of Sunny\u0027s mast. Using a rather special Demon Fruit, Breed has managed to retrieve Caesar Clown from under the noses of the Straw Hat Crew, who are delighted by this turn of events. Commanding an army of Kung-Fu Dugongs devoted to his service, he orders them to fight against the Straw Hat before attacking his ship, which is caught in huge whirlpools that threaten to engulf it at any moment. Law understands that the situation is serious, especially as the ship has become uncontrollable and seems to be inexorably drawn towards a strange island that is in fact a pirate ship! Caught up in the turmoil, Franky suggests that Luffy take the Shark Submerge III, which can carry three people underwater, to try and escape. The Straw Hat obeys his friend, taking Chopper and Trafalgar Law into his suite, who advises Usopp to be on his guard against a possible arrival from Doflamingo. Taking the pocket submarine out into the raging sea, Luffy, Chopper and Law, all users of Demon Fruit, risk losing their lives at any moment if their boat sinks to the bottom of the ocean.\nOur three heroes have spotted Breed\u0027s accomplices, the Sea Rabbits, swimming in a shoal. Luffy orders Chopper to accelerate the speed of their submarine to catch up with them. The little reindeer obeys, as he too wants to find out more about these mysterious animals. Indeed, these strange creatures remind him of the animals he encountered on his native island, the Kingdom of Drum. As for Law, he\u0027s determined to find out who their new attacker is, who\u0027s in charge of the sea rabbits, and whether he\u0027s really working for Doflamingo. Suddenly, Luffy sees the Sea Rabbits enter the hull of the strange pirate ship. They enter too, and find themselves inside the ship. Trafalgar Law is the first to emerge from the pocket submarine. He is soon followed by Luffy and Chopper. Law instructs his companions to keep a low profile, but Luffy is in over his head, shouting too loudly because he\u0027s too happy to be aboard this mysterious vessel. Our three heroes discover that it\u0027s in fact a huge aquarium with portholes overlooking the sea. They don\u0027t have time to linger, however, as they are soon attacked by strange animals all wearing strange greenish collars around their necks: sea rabbits, of course, but also other equally extravagant creatures, including a huge octopus that bears a striking resemblance to Surume. Each using the powers conferred by their Fruit of the Demon, Law, Chopper and Luffy battle valiantly against their adversaries to defeat them completely. Just when Luffy and his friends thought they had taken them all down, a Kung-Fu Dugong appears. Using the powers of Fluid, he attacks our friends. Le Chapeau de Paille takes this attack seriously and sets out to deal with him. After the victorious outcome, Luffy raises his arms in celebration. Suddenly, the Kung-Fu Dugong he had just defeated leaps to his feet and throws itself into his arms, as if reunited with an old friend. Indeed, this animal knows the Straw Hat very well, having already fought him when he was in Alabasta to save Princess Vivi\u0027s kingdom from the clutches of the odious Crocodile. Luffy is surprised by this outpouring of tenderness. Chopper begins to understand what\u0027s going on and reveals to his companions that it\u0027s the same animal they met on their Alabasta adventure: the Kung-Fu Dugong. Meanwhile, Caesar Clown, still handcuffed, finds himself behind bars. He orders his immediate release. Suddenly Breed appears and begins to abuse him. Caesar, unaccustomed to such treatment, wants to be handed over to Doflamingo, but discovers, too late, that his new jailer is not working for the Joker. At the same time, Luffy clearly remembers the Kung-Fu Dugong he met in Alabasta and seems happy to be reunited. The latter feels the same way. After fraternizing, Luffy shows his new friend some of the fighting moves he needs to master to perfect his kung fu style. Chopper watches in amazement. The Straw Hat suddenly notices a strange cross drawn on Kung-Fu Dugong\u0027s torso, similar to his own. His new friend, who is very sorry to have attacked the Straw Hat\u0027s ship, admits to having copied it from a newspaper to resemble him, and begins to explain. Amazed at the idea of one day becoming a pirate like Luffy, Kung-Fu Dugong set off on his own adventure, facing a thousand dangers before forming a crew of sea creatures with other animals. United, they set off for the New World. But no sooner had they arrived than he and his friends were bewitched by Breed, who incorporated them into his own crew. The dejected Kung-Fu Dugong confessed to Luffy and his companions that it was on Breed\u0027s orders that they had kidnapped Clown. Suddenly, a loud voice comes over the loudspeakers, calling the sea animals to attention. Their greenish collars begin to glow and, as one, they all line up in front of Breed, who makes his appearance. Paying no attention to Luffy and his companions, he berates his subordinates for their ineptitude in obeying his orders quickly. Not wasting a single second, Law asks Breed to return Caesar Clown, their prisoner, to them immediately. But instead, the latter taunts Luffy and Trafalgar Law before launching a lightning attack on them before the helpless eyes of their new friend. The Straw Hat and the Shichibukai dodge it, but not Chopper, who finds himself trapped with a greenish necklace around his neck! Breed orders the little reindeer to attack his friends. Unable to control his body, Chopper crunches a Rumble Ball which transforms him into an uncontrollable monster who tears up everything in his path. He starts attacking Law and Luffy, who try to reason with him, but to no avail. Chopper orders his friends to leave Breed\u0027s ship immediately. The Shichibukai tries to subdue him with his power, but Luffy stops him for fear of hurting Chopper. Breed takes advantage of this moment of inattention to muzzle his two adversaries by encircling their necks with his necklaces. Luffy and Law find themselves trapped and at the mercy of this lawless man.",

        "description": "Now at Breed\u0027s mercy, Luffy and Law must dodge the attacks of their friend Chopper, who has become uncontrollable. As he assaults them, the Straw Hat desperately tries to remove from his neck the greenish ring that Breed had put on him using his power, but to no avail. Stopping Chopper for a moment, Breed reveals his plan to Luffy and Law, telling them it was they he wanted. The young pirate refused to give in so easily, and tried to rebel, but his whole body refused to obey him! Like his comrade Trafalgar Law, Luffy is unable to fight this man\u0027s power, and must submit in spite of himself, becoming his slave. As Breed savors his triumph, Chopper suddenly reverts to his normal self. Stunned by this transformation, Breed falls in ecstasy before Chopper and can\u0027t resist the urge to hug and cuddle him. This strange behavior greatly disturbs the little reindeer, who can do nothing about it. Luffy wants to help his friend, but is quickly put in his place. To prevent Law and the Straw Hat from revolting against him again, Breed orders his \u0022pets\u0022 to place Sea Granite handcuffs on the wrists of the two pirates to nullify the effects of their Demon Fruits.\nLocked under guard in a cell with Law, Luffy despairs at the plight of Chopper, who is now defenseless against Breed. Never losing his cool, the Shichibukai discovers that the bars of their prison are also made of Sea Granite, which annihilates their powers. This observation is supported by the presence of Caesar, who is imprisoned in a cell adjacent to theirs. Punk Hazard\u0027s former master is also Breed\u0027s prisoner. He informs them that Breed has no affiliation with Don Quixote Doflamingo, working on his own behalf to build a kingdom in his own image. Eavesdropped on by snail phones set up all over the room where they\u0027re locked in, Breed overhears their conversation and orders Caesar to lie down. Breed then introduces Luffy to his new \u0022pet\u0022, Chappy. It\u0027s actually Chopper, whom this strange individual had disguised as a lounge reindeer. The Straw Hat bursts out laughing at the sight of his friend dressed in this way, and as for the latter, he\u0027s totally exhausted from the Rumble Ball he\u0027d taken to transform himself into a monster. As he tries to escape from Breed\u0027s hug, Chopper accidentally scratches his cheek. Such behavior is unacceptable for a pet, and Breed lets him know it by savagely whipping Chopper. Luffy suddenly stops laughing and sees the little reindeer slump to the ground. He begs Breed to stop correcting his friend. Hearing the word \u0022friend\u0022, the latter stopped his punishment and painful memories came flooding back. Despising the human species that had done him so much harm in the past, Breed confessed to Caesar that he needed him to create his new kingdom by making him Zoan Demon Fruits to turn all humans on the planet into animals who would be submissive to him thanks to the power of Peto Peto no Mi! But Luffy is not a man to be easily subdued, and lets him know it. His insubordination is quickly punished by Breed, who catches him with his whip without mercy. But Breed doesn\u0027t want to kill him immediately, as he wants to turn him into a slave devoted to his sole service. To achieve this, Breed takes the cell in which Luffy and Law are locked up to the floor above; then, after freeing them from their shackles and prison bars, places them at the heart of a huge attraction worthy of the greatest circus. Using the power of his Demon Fruit, Breed orders the two pirates to kill each other, much to his delight. Facing each other, Luffy and Law are ready to fight, while Chopper begs them to stop. Even the Kung-Fu Dugong the Straw Hat had known in Alabasta is no match for Breed\u0027s might. Breed savors his triumph alongside Caesar, who is still submissive to him. The young pirate and the Shichibukai begin to fight, using their most powerful fighting techniques. Breed is ecstatic. He forces the Straw Hat and Law to fight to the finish, much to the fear of Chopper and Kung-Fu Dugong. During their confrontation, the two pirates reach the stage where Caesar and Breed are standing and pulverize it in a matter of seconds. The former master of Punk Hazard takes advantage of this incident to tiptoe away, only to be caught by Breed, who has every intention of getting his hands on him again. He lets him go, however, because he wants to contemplate the bloody spectacle offered by Luffy and Law. But this is too much for the Kung-Fu Dugong who, with tears in his eyes, steps in between the two fighters. Breed brings him to order by abusing him harshly with his whip. But he understands what his \u0022pet\u0022 was trying to tell him: Breed brutally interrupts the fight between the two pirates, whose bodies instantly stop fighting. Kung-Fu Dugong is overjoyed to see Luffy still alive, whereas Breed wanted him dead. Suddenly, Breed had a diabolical idea: he ordered Kung-Fu Dugong to fight the two pirates to the death. Unable to fight against his will, the poor little seal had to do his master\u0027s bidding. Looking longingly into Luffy\u0027s eyes, he began to weep heavy tears of spite. The Straw Hat consoled him by forcing him to hit him. Using his Haki, the Kung-Fu Dugong administers a punch to Luffy\u0027s stomach. Luffy doesn\u0027t flinch, standing proudly in front of him. Still crying, the Dugong strikes Luffy and Law, who don\u0027t even defend themselves. While threatening the Kung-Fu Dugong with the worst reprisals if he didn\u0027t obey, Breed ordered him to throw the two pirates into the sea. Luffy, who knows what would happen to him in the water, asks his friend to carry out the sentence, and with a heavy heart, the poor little seal sends Luffy and Law into the sea before uttering a heart-rending cry of despair...",

        "description": "Chopper and Kung-Fu Dugong can\u0027t believe Luffy and Law are dead, having both been thrown into the sea. The little seal that the Straw Hat had met during his stopover in Alabasta is crying his eyes out. But he is interrupted in his sadness by Breed, who celebrates the victory of his \u0022pet\u0022 over these two \u0022useless humans\u0022 with a hearty round of applause. However, this apparent joy does not please Kung-Fu Dugong, who tries to hit his master. The latter subdues his rebellion by using his power, which suppresses all willpower in those afflicted. Kung-Fu Dugong, humiliated, tries to get up, but is mistreated by Breed, much to the chagrin of Chopper, who can do nothing to save his friend. The master of Kung-Fu Dugong suddenly remembers the little reindeer and can\u0027t help cuddling him, promising him a place of honour in his future kingdom. To achieve this, he asks him to forget the Straw Hat, a task too difficult for Chopper, who rebels against his authority by slapping Breed\u0027s face with his paw. All his \u0022pets\u0022 are shocked by the little reindeer\u0027s attitude towards their master. Breed doesn\u0027t understand his \u0022Chappy\u0027s\u0022 gesture, which finally reveals his true face. Tearing off the cap that Breed had put on his head, the Straw Hat crew\u0027s ship\u0027s doctor cries out loud and clear that he belongs with the pirates, and that he wants to live free at the risk of dying. This declaration rekindles distant memories in the Kung-Fu Dugong, who clearly remembers the words Luffy spoke when the little seal met him in Alabasta. For his part, Breed tries to regain his composure and punishes Chopper for his impertinence. But Chopper couldn\u0027t care less, as he considers the Straw Hat to be his only captain, to whom he has sworn obedience. Even though he was thrown into the sea with Trafalgar Law and had no chance of escape, Breed could never destroy Luffy\u0027s dream of one day becoming King of the Pirates.\nNot knowing what Chopper was talking about, Breed hit him with all his might, but the little reindeer was tough. He predicts that he\u0027ll never be able to create his ideal kingdom, because Breed doesn\u0027t make the effort to understand those around him for a moment. This incident reminds Breed of a painful memory: when he was abandoned at sea, aboard a longboat, by his own crewmen who criticized him for not listening to them. This reminiscence of the past provokes Breed\u0027s anger, and he whips Chopper mercilessly. Kung-Fu Dugong immediately comes to his rescue, while Breed catches his breath. He orders his Sea Rabbits to finish off Chopper and Kung-Fu Dugong. The latter, like good soldiers, obey him and attack the two unfortunate friends. They are suddenly stopped in their tracks and hurled into the air by an unknown force. Breed can\u0027t believe his eyes when he suddenly sees Luffy and Law alive and well, still wearing his greenish necklace. Breed also notices that the two pirates have picked up Caesar Clown, still handcuffed, who had tried to escape. Determined to get his revenge, the Straw Hat warns Breed that he\u0027s in for a rough time. The latter, who doesn\u0027t understand what\u0027s going on, tries to control them with his power, but finds, frightened, that he can no longer command the two men. Amused, Law explains, with a smile, that he and Luffy have discovered the Achilles\u0027 heel of Peto Peto no Mi. All they had to do was plug their ears and they would no longer be subjected to it. He had discovered that Breed\u0027s base was riddled with snail phones and numerous loudspeakers designed to transmit his orders. Law had realized this when Breed had ordered Caesar to lie down in front of him like a dog. The Shichibukai also pointed out that he had pretended to be controlled by his power when fighting Luffy. Luffy, on the other hand, had been totally manipulated during their duel. Not understanding what his friend was talking about, since he too had plugged his ears, the Straw Hat is ready to do battle with Breed as Law continues his explanations. After the Kung-Fu Dugong had thrown them into the sea, Law, who was not subject to the power of Peto Peto no Mi, was able to use the ability of his Demon Fruit to save his own life and that of the Straw Hat. Using two rocks to fool Breed into believing they had fallen into the sea, the two pirates leapt back to the entrance of Breed\u0027s base, where the Straw Hat submarine was moored and where Caesar Clown, who had escaped, was. Unfortunately for the former master of Punk Hazard, his escape attempt was short-lived, and he bemoans his misfortune to Breed, who doesn\u0027t care. Eager not to be fooled by such adversaries, Breed reveals the true power of Peto Peto no Mi by deliberately placing a greenish collar around his neck. Then, drunk with vengeance, he transforms himself into a muscular being who will make mincemeat of his enemies...\n\nOrdering his Sea Rabbits to line up in front of him, Breed gathers all his troops to kill Luffy and his companions. Coming down on them like a hailstorm, the Straw Hat barely avoids their attacks to avoid injury. While Chopper tries to reason with Breed, Kung-Fu Dugong gradually loses his nerve. As Breed tries to flatten Luffy\u0027s head, the seal comes between them, ready to fight his former master, who will no longer have the power to mistreat his friends again. As the Kung-Fu Dugong admits, through Chopper\u0027s mouth, that he and his people were no longer his \u0022lapdogs\u0022, the latter rise to their feet and, with eyes full of rage, are ready to correct Breed. For his part, Luffy is delighted by this turn of events and asks the little seal to help him take his revenge on Breed. Breed is furious and sees his former subordinates standing in front of him. Ordering one of his Sea Rabbits to join him, he spins it in the air until it creates a huge whirlpool that pulls everything in its path. However, Luffy and Kung-Fu Dugong are not impressed by his power and prepare for battle. Believing his victory to be at hand, Breed is stopped by his own soldiers, who struggle against the persuasive power of his orders. The Straw Hat and the seal take advantage of this moment to combine their forces in a dazzling punch right into Breed\u0027s stomach, sending him hurtling out of his ship and high into the sky. Breed\u0027s grip disappears as if by magic, and soon his collars of obedience shatter into a thousand pieces, much to the delight of Luffy and his friends. At the same time, aboard the Thousand Sunny, Franky watches the horizon carefully in search of his missing companions. For their part, Usopp and Sanji see a large wave, formed by Sea Rabbits, coming closer and closer to their ship before hearing familiar cries. They see Luffy and Chopper in the company of the Kung-Fu Dugong, waving to them. After this happy ending, it\u0027s time to say goodbye. As one of the Sea Rabbits explains the quickest way to Dressrosa, the Straw Hat warmly thanks Kung-Fu Dugong\u0027s companions for rebelling against their former master. They\u0027re ready to explore the New World for new adventures. Their enthusiasm is welcomed by Luffy, who wishes them every success as pirates.\n\nAs day breaks, Kung-Fu Dugong bids a fitting farewell to the Straw Hats, swearing eternal friendship to Luffy. Then, joining his companions, the seal sets off on an adventure. While Brook is lost in contemplation of the pirate animals, a Postman Martin brings them the morning paper, which contains a very interesting article: the pirate Don Quixote Doflamingo is giving up his title of Chief Corsair as he had promised Law, renouncing at the same time the throne of Dressrosa he had held for ten years. While the members of the Straw Hat Crew, Kinemon and Momonosuke are still reeling from the news, Trafalgar Law is happy that his opponent has made the right choice. But there\u0027s another article that catches his eye, featuring his photo and that of Luffy. According to the article, Trafalgar Law and the Straw Hat have formed a pirate alliance, and they\u0027re not the only ones to have done so. Indeed, in various parts of the world, the planet\u0027s inhabitants learn to their horror that pirates Eustass Kidd, Scratchmen Apoo and Basil Hawkins are also forming an alliance to thwart the power of the Navy. However, Trafalgar Law is only interested in one thing: ruining Doflamingo\u0027s plans, and that began with the capture of Caesar Clown at Punk Hazard. At the same time, in Dressrosa, Doflamingo\u0027s subjects despair at their sovereign\u0027s decision to renounce the throne. Doflamingo listens quietly to music, oblivious to the sadness of his people and the noise of the many snails in his palace. Yet only one attracts his attention. It\u0027s the snailophone bearing the effigy of Trafalgar Law, who is desperately trying to reach him. The former Shichibukai picks up the receiver and quietly confirms his decision to renounce his title of Chief Corsair for good...",

The men who have been pestering the blind man get angry and tell him that this is none of his business. However, the mysterious man thanks Luffy for his frankness, and just as the thugs are about to lay their hands on the Straw Hat, he pulls a sword from his cane and forms a giant dark hole in the floor, knocking several of his opponents into it!\nAll the restaurant\u0027s customers are stunned by the power of this blind man. The crew soon realize that this strange individual possesses the powers of a Demon Fruit. Luffy, for his part, immediately asks him for his identity, but the man laughs and tells him it would be better not to answer his question, for everyone\u0027s sake. After the old man leaves the restaurant, all the customers panic when they see that items belonging to them have disappeared, including Zoro\u0027s Shuusui, the treasure of the Land of Wa, according to Kinemon.

The latter doesn\u0027t seem to know anything about the Smiles factory, but claims that his superiors are at the Coliseum Corrida, where a big event is due to take place and an incredible prize will be awarded to the winner.

Guided by an employee of the Colis\u00e9e Corrida, the Straw Hat enters a sort of waiting room where he watches the other gladiators train. One of them, Spartan, gets angry at the sight of Luffy, whom he considers a weakling, and attacks him. Luffy easily dodges his punch thanks to his Observation Haki, then gives him an arm lock before throwing him to the ground before the stunned eyes of the other competitors.\nAfter this feat, Luffy narrowly escapes elimination thanks to the intervention of the Ka Country Gang, the Chinjao Family (Boo, Xai and Don Chinjao), who certify that it was indeed Spartan who had started the fight and that he should be disqualified. The Straw Hat thanks his new friends for helping him, but Xai rejects his gratitude and tries to attack him before he is overpowered by his acolytes. One by one, famous warriors from every known country and organization are introduced, including Bobby and Kerry Funk, nicknamed the Funk Brothers, notorious assassins from a neighboring kingdom, and Dagama, a famous military strategist from the Kingdom of Prodense, who accompanies his sovereign, King Elizabello II, or Suleyman, \u0022the Neckbreaker\u0022, who must be wary of both Abdullah and Jeet, two infamous bounty hunters, and Orombus, the admiral of a large naval fleet, who have also come to compete for the Mera Mera no Mi. Among these illustrious participants is Bellamy the Hyena, who makes a comeback after everyone thought he was dead.\nIn front of a raucous audience, Gats explains the rules of the game to the Coliseum Corrida spectators: the 550 competitors have been divided into four distinct groups, from A to D, and a battle royale will be organized in each of these blocks where only one person can emerge victorious. Luffy is in group C. As he dons a suit of armor, the Straw Hat spots the status of Kyros, the strongest gladiator in the Coliseum Corrida. Suddenly, the notorious pirate Cavendish makes his entrance, causing the entire female staff of the Coliseum Corrida to succumb in his wake.

At the same time, Rebecca, a beautiful gladiatrix, makes her appearance. Luffy makes her acquaintance as he carefully examines the magnificent statue of Kyros, the strongest fighter the Coliseum Corrida has ever known. The young woman, who is delighted that Lucy has beaten Spartan, explains the legend of Kyros. He is the strongest gladiator in Dressrosa, victorious in 3,000 fights and wounded only once. Participating in Block D, Rebecca, who is mocked by the other gladiators, has every intention of winning the tournament and the Mera Mera no Mi in order to kill Doflamingo with her own hands!\nMeanwhile, in the arena, the Battle Royale of Block A takes place and the name of the winner is revealed by Gats: it\u0027s \u0022The Masked Man, Mr. Store\u0022. The latter, who has a paper bag over his head, removes it and reveals his true identity to the audience and the other participants: he is Jesus Burgess, a fearsome member of Blackbeard\u0027s crew, who after the ellipsis has become commander of his first fleet.

But the Lightning Fury soldier takes Franky to a secluded spot so they can discuss the cyborg\u0027s \u0022work\u0022. At the same time, a Marine soldier, hiding in the shadows, begins to panic, indicating that he needs reinforcements because the competitors\u0027 power has exceeded his expectations.

At the same time, Bartolomeo discovers Gambia\u0027s lifeless body, butchered by Maynard. Meanwhile, in a caf\u00e9 on the northeastern outskirts of Dressrosa, the team assigned to escort Caesar Clown to Green Bit ask a waiter for directions to the island. The waiter strongly advises them against going there, as Green Bit is an unsafe and very dangerous place. Robin suddenly notices the presence of CP0, a government organization even more powerful than CP9. Not far away, Zoro is still in pursuit of the thief who stole Shuusui from him. Climbing over the roofs of houses, the fencer finally manages to catch him, while Kinemon desperately searches the streets of Dressrosa for his friend Kanjuro. But his zeal attracts the attention of Doflamingo\u0027s henchmen, who stop him at gunpoint.\nAt the Colis\u00e9e Corrida, Gats, the tournament\u0027s star presenter, announces to the spectators that the Battle Royale of Block B is about to begin. Backstage, Maynard is accosted by Bartolomeo, who has discovered his true identity and realized that this fearsome naval officer had entered the tournament in order to arrest all the pirates whose heads were wanted.\nFar from this torment, Sanji continues to live in perfect love with the pretty Violette, without the two lovebirds knowing that they are being closely followed by strange individuals in Doflamingo\u0027s pay. After overpowering a sniper who was trying to take his life, Sanji is praised by Violette, who begins to take a liking to him, much to her delight. The same carefree attitude can be found among the occupants of the Thousand Sunny, who have stayed on board to ensure the ship\u0027s safety: Momonosuke is pampered like a prince by Chopper, while Nami gives him her undivided attention, much to the dismay of Brook, who is left to fend for himself. But their tranquillity is brutally interrupted by the appearance of Jora, who has transformed the entire interior of the boat into a work of art! At the same time, at the Coliseum Corrida, Bartolomeo, after overcoming Maynard in a duel to the death, makes a triumphant entry into the arena to take part in the Battle Royale of Block B, provoking both the enthusiasm of the crowd and the hatred of the other members of the competition...",

Meanwhile, other gladiators such as Jao-Kun Do, Blue Gilly, Tank Lepanto, Abdullah, Jeet and Hack, a Man-Fish expert in martial arts, are fighting as one after another is eliminated and falls into the water surrounding the Colosseum arena: infested with dangerous Fighting Fish, the arena\u0027s specialty.

They persuade him to wait and stay focused on \u0022their real objective\u0022; especially as Luffy is also with them in C Block, they\u0027ll have the chance to kill him once the battle begins. Cavendish, however, has no intention of letting things go that way, and intends to kill the Straw Hat before the battle begins. So he sets out to hunt him down, but the Straw Hat hides outside, suspended under the grandstand windows, where he can follow the progress of the Battle Royale in Block B.\nThis one continues with the same intensity: about half the fighters have been eliminated and only 70 remain standing in the ring. Hack, the Fish Man, easily overcomes his eighteenth opponent, who was armed with a club, while Ricky triumphs over all his foes with disconcerting ease and even matches the Fish Man\u0027s score, before the stunned eyes of the Colis\u00e9e Corrida audience and Gats. Not far away, the duo of criminals, Abdullah and Jeet, have defeated ten opponents in one go, and attempt to attack Tank Lepanto, who is valiantly protecting Elizabello II as he warms up.

Against all odds, his action had no effect, as a strange invisible barrier appeared behind Bartolomeo and protected him.

Bellamy compliments Luffy on the power of his Haki, before blaming himself for not being able to change and for losing again. Luffy assures him that he has indeed changed, and Bellamy \u0022thanks\u0022 him for encouraging him during his fight in B Block. During their conversation, they are spied on by Bartolomeo, who unwittingly discovers Luffy\u0027s identity and is shocked.

However, they are attacked by Fighting Fish, and the small group is forced to run for their lives. Seeing that all must fight, Usopp is forced to free Caesar, who is protecting their backs after learning that Law has his heart in his possession and, knowing this, the former master of Punk Hazard could under no circumstances attempt to escape at the risk of death. As Robin and his friends set off for Green Bit, they are startled to discover that part of the bridge has collapsed. They also notice that a Fighting Fish is coming dangerously close to attack them. Leaping into the air, the animal is trapped in a giant fishing net, which appears to belong to the island\u0027s inhabitants.

Finally, using Caesar\u0027s power of flight, the pirate alliance quietly flies over the bridge, well protected from the attacks of Fighting Fish.

The young woman, overcome with remorse, tries to dissuade him, but it\u0027s too late. Entering a warehouse, Sanji easily overcomes the henchmen of the person he was supposed to kill, but the latter takes Violette hostage by pointing the barrel of his pistol at her temple. This threat doesn\u0027t distract Sanji, who, in his own way, delivers a stinging beating to the man who wanted to kill his beloved. The latter, grateful, uses her strength against her savior.

Suddenly, C\u00e9sar gets angry and, thinking he\u0027s no longer safe with his captors, tells Trafalgar Law that the exchange is no longer valid. But Trafalgar Law retorts that the Navy soldiers are also his enemies, now that he\u0027s made an alliance with the Straw Hats.\nAfter leaving Caesar Clown and Trafalgar Law, Robin and Usopp begin to explore the jungle and soon discover a group of Navy soldiers who seem to be looking for the Straw Hats. Soon, a strange voice is heard in the thicket belonging to a certain Leo, who demands that they lay down their arms, but the soldiers refuse and fire warning shots to intimidate their adversary. Unimpressed, Leo steals their clothes and weapons at lightning speed. Frightened, the Marine soldiers run out of the forest after being stripped of all their belongings. Wanting to know the truth, Robin intervenes and uses her powers to find out the identity of the assailant. Using the \u0022Thousand Flowers\u0022 attack, she manages to catch the intruder and discovers that he is in fact a dwarf!\nMeanwhile, in the port city of Acacia, Zoro has managed to capture the thief who stole his sword. The thief is a dwarf called Wicca, who feels guilty at having been taken by a mere human. After confessing to having sprained her ankle in the act of capture, she asks the fencer to take her to the Flower Fields to warn her commander that the Doflamingo Family is planning to attack the Straw Hat ship. Zoro has no choice but to take him along and be guided, after Wicca discovers that the swordsman has a horrible sense of direction.\nMeanwhile, at the Coliseum Corrida, Don Chinjao is desperate for Luffy to settle his score. But his grandsons, Sai and Boo, are there to pull him together to avoid being disqualified before the start of the C Block Battle Royale, in which they and Garp\u0027s grandson are taking part. The latter, who had climbed to the top of a column to escape his pursuers, laments Chinjao\u0027s nagging resentment.\nMeanwhile, in the next town, Sanji is captured and handcuffed by Violette, who is in cahoots with the men the Straw Hat Crew\u0027s cook had knocked out. We discover that the young woman is in fact an assassin in the pay of Trebol, an important member of Don Quixote Doflamingo\u0027s Crew. The latter had managed to trap him with her charms, but Sanji thinks it was a mistake, and that she always has a good heart. To show him that he\u0027s got her all wrong, Violette gives him a hard kick in the face, then uses her power to read his mind and find out what the Straw Hat Crew and Trafalgar Law are up to in Dressrosa and Green Bit. Unfortunately for her, she can only see his perverse thoughts, which openly shock her. But Sanji reassures her that he will never again doubt a woman\u0027s tears. Touched by these words, Violette is overwhelmed by Sanji\u0027s sincerity...",

Mocking him, they try to assassinate him, but Violette stops them using her \u0022Mekujira\u0022 attack, which nails them in place. Afterwards, she frees the cook from the Straw Hat Crew and shows him, with the power of her Demon Fruit, the plan Doflamingo had devised to trap them.\nMeanwhile, in the Colis\u00e9e Corrida, Gats, after reminding the audience of the winners of the previous two blocks, announces the start of the Battle Royale of Block C, in which Luffy takes part. The latter, in full concentration, meets a bull with steaming nostrils, while Don Chinjao and his two grandsons tremble impatiently waiting for the fight to begin. The fight begins and all the gladiators make their way to the ring to face each other. Backstage, Rebecca remembers the wise words of Soldier Lightning Fury, who had promised to always be at her side to protect her whatever happened. Thinking she had been dreaming, the young gladiator sees Franky from the window, carrying the Toy Soldier on his shoulder. Rebecca is shocked to see them. It seems there was indeed a love affair between the pretty gladiatrix and the one-legged toy soldier. Franky wonders about the affair, but is rudely interrupted by the soldier, who tells her that even toys have something to protect.\nAt the same time, in the Green Bit forest, Robin is interrogating the dwarf she has managed to catch. As Usopp joins her, they are attacked by other dwarves who send them soporific flowers. Losing consciousness, the two pirates are at the mercy of the islanders, who want to make them disappear. After a long coma, the young archaeologist wakes up to find that her entire body has been sewn to the floor! She discovers the dwarves, who take fright at the sight of her. But Leo, their leader, is the least fearful of all and confesses to Robin that it was he who had immobilized her with his power. The young woman also notices that she had been transported to the Kingdom of Tontatta, nestled in the heart of Green Bit, and that Usopp was no longer with her. Defending herself as best she could, Robin assures the dwarves that she is no threat to them. Convinced of her good faith, they release her and place their trust in her, much to the astonishment of their ruler, Gancho the Chief Tonta, who also believes in Robin\u0027s sincerity. But when she tries to steal their company in an attempt to join Law for the Caesar exchange scheduled for 3:00 pm, the dwarves become enraged. She narrowly escapes the mob\u0027s wrath thanks to another dwarf who claims she\u0027s a friend of the legendary Tontatta hero, Usopp.\nAt the same time, on the beach at Green Bit, Trafalgar Law is keeping an eye on the former master of Punk Hazard when he receives a snail phone call from Sanji warning him that he has fallen into a trap...",

        "description": "It\u0027s nearly 3pm. As Trafalgar Law watches over his prisoner on Green Bit\u0027s southeast beach, he receives a snail phone call from Sanji, warning him that he\u0027s been ambushed. The caller flees with Violette to outrun their pursuers, swords in hand, through the streets of the town. Shooting at them, the two fugitives narrowly escape death thanks to the Black Leg\u0027s skills. Having subdued his assailants, Sanji advises Law to leave immediately, explaining that there is no deal to be made with Doflamingo, as he has never left the ranks of the Shichibukai. This news comes as a surprise to the great corsair. Flashback. Thanks to Violette\u0027s gifts, Sanji knows what happened on Dressrosa before their arrival: Doflamingo didn\u0027t resign, and a navy warship bearing the CP0 logo arrived on the island. Its passengers, their faces hidden under masks, are directly under the orders of the World Nobles. The latter announced to the crowd that the news given in the morning paper was false, and that a denial would be published in the 3:00 p.m. paper.\nHaving realized that he had fallen into a trap, Law tries to flee, but Doflamingo appears, using his gifts of levitation. He quickly heads for Green Bit while Fujitora and his men approach the scene of the exchange. The Admiral, deep in escargophonic conversation with Sakazuki, is embarrassed to learn that Doflamingo\u0027s resignation was a mistake. For his part, Trafalgar Law doesn\u0027t know what to do when Robin miraculously emerges from the sand. In fact, it\u0027s a clone of the young archaeologist, created by the Hana Hana no Mi. She explains to her companions that she is inside the island with Usopp. She implores them to leave Green Bit as soon as possible, as she has also heard Sanji\u0027s call. Robin reassures her that they\u0027ll meet at the harbor, which is their next rendezvous point. But it\u0027s too late, as Fujitora and the Navy soldiers are already there! The admiral steps in front of Law and Caesar Clown when Doflamingo makes a grand entrance. The former master of Punk Hazard is very happy to see his boss again. At 3.00 p.m., Dressrosa\u0027s bells start ringing as Doflamingo and Fujitora face Law and Caesar, who discover they\u0027ve been trapped in style...\nAt the same time, at the Coliseum Corrida, the Battle Royale of Block C begins to the cheers of a packed audience. Gats introduces all the tournament\u0027s top contenders: Sai, Kerry Funk, Jean Ango, Boo, Ideo, Fighting Bull, Hajrudin, Bobby Funk, Don Chinjao and not forgetting Lucy, who is all set to take part in what promises to be an epic battle. Just as the Battle of C Block is about to begin, Cavendish emerges after learning that the Straw Hat is in the ring. But as he\u0027s one of the participants in Block D, he\u0027s arrested on the spot by the Colosseum guards watching over the entrance. Without him being able to do anything, he sees the young pirate bursting with joy when he hears the gong sound to announce the start of the fights. The fights are spectacular and delight the entire crowd. All blows are allowed, and the unlucky ones end up being devoured by the Fighting Fish that swim around the ring. Luffy uses his powers to strike down his opponents. In doing so, he unwittingly reveals his true identity. The Straw Hat must now master his moves if he is to win the tournament without getting caught! As Luffy is cheered on by the audience trying to find out who he is, Cavendish cries out for the truth, but it\u0027s no use. He\u0027s led away manu militari to the stands by Colosseum security.\nHaving noticed that \u0022Lucy\u0022 is a tough opponent, several fighters decide to attack him all at once. Le Chapeau de Paille easily dodges their attack and inflicts a severe beating. But he has a run-in with a powerful warrior armed with a hammer. But fortunately for him, Luffy quickly gets the upper hand, much to the delight of his admirers. His assailant finishes the tournament in the Fighting Fish-infested pool, while Luffy, intoxicated by the taste of victory, has to keep fighting if he doesn\u0027t want to lose.\nAt the same time, over Dressrosa, a swarm of Martins Factors flies overhead and everyone on the planet is surprised to learn that Doflamingo has not renounced his status as Grand Corsair. This news is relayed to Green Bit, where Trafalgar Law is shocked to learn that Don Quixote Doflamingo has managed to get false information published in a newspaper. The only people capable of doing this are the Celestial Dragons. He then realizes that Doflamingo was once one of them! Now that Law knows the truth, the Shichibukai calmly tells Luffy\u0027s ally that he\u0027s going to kill him...",

        "description": "At Green Bit, Trafalgar Law and Doflamingo face off. Law wonders whether the terms of the exchange should be reviewed, as Doflamingo had not respected them. Doflamingo orders him to release Caesar Clown immediately. A Navy soldier warns Issho that Punk Hazard\u0027s former master is present on the scene, and Issho replies that if he\u0027s just one of Doflamingo\u0027s subordinates, he shouldn\u0027t be captured. For his part, Doflamingo starts talking to Fujitora. Fujitora tells him how he became an admiral, and alludes to a certain Ryokugyu, undoubtedly the third admiral, pointing out that he had the same power as Doflamingo. Issho then explains that he has information on Doflamingo\u0027s actions in the underworld. He also talks to Law, and states that if he and the Straw Hat Crew have indeed formed an alliance, he will be removed from office. If, on the other hand, they are merely subordinates, nothing will happen. Law confirms that he and Luffy have formed an alliance, in order to gain time. This news angers Fujitora. He attacks him with a meteorite. The bolide heads for Green Bit beach. Caesar and the Marine soldiers immediately flee to avoid perishing, but Law remains on the spot and manages to cut the meteorite with his power. Doflamingo does the same with his Demon Fruit, while Fujitora defends himself by forming a sort of protective barrier above him with his katana. The impact of the meteorite fragments creates a huge crater where Fujitora, Doflamingo and Law had been standing. When the smoke clears, Caesar and the soldiers see three columns on each of which stand the three combatants. They face each other and challenge each other to a duel.\nMeanwhile, in Dressrosa, Franky and Sanji discuss their plan to destroy the Smile Factory via snail phone. As the Straw Hat crew\u0027s cook runs off with Violette, they see Luffy fighting in the Coliseum Corrida on a giant screen. This discovery exasperates Sanji, who gets angry at Franky for not keeping an eye on their captain and letting him do whatever he wants. For her part, Violette, seeing her pursuers coming thanks to her gift of vision, gives Sanji a map to Doflamingo\u0027s factory via the House of Toys. After Sanji asks her to meet him at the West Port, Violette flees just as Kinemon arrives unexpectedly. The samurai asks Sanji to deal with the members of the Donquichote Family who are pursuing him. After the cook defeats them, he asks him to accompany him to a place called \u0022The House of Toys\u0022 and claims that his friend Kanjuro is being held there.\nMeanwhile, at the Coliseum Corrida, Lucy\u0027s exploits are relayed by Gats\u0027 microphone to a cheering audience. The young gladiator continues to fight as if nothing had happened when he is attacked by Fighting Bull. Fighting Bull had previously confronted death row inmates and defeated them before the terrified eyes of Dressrosa\u0027s inhabitants. Now it\u0027s Lucy\u0027s turn to suffer the same fate, but the opposite happens. Using her gift of evasion, Lucy manages to further irritate the animal, which lunges at her. However, Lucy manages to stop it just in time, thanks to the power of her Haki, and even straddles it before the bewildered eyes of the Colis\u00e9e Corrida audience and Gats.\nAt the same time, in Green Bit, the tremors of the fight between Doflamingo, Law and Fujitora are felt, causing indescribable chaos in the Kingdom of Tontatta. While Usopp is eating, he and Robin discover a statue of Montblanc Norland. Leo then tells them that Norland came to Green Bit 400 years ago and defended the residents of the Dwarf Kingdom against the Great Humans who wanted to harm them. The Dwarves then ask Usopp to accompany them to Champ de Fleurs to fight against the Donquichote Family, who have oppressed them for many years...",

Nami, Brook, Chopper and Momonosuke escape with the Shark Submerge III and the young sailor\u0027s waver. Unfortunately, Jora of the Doflamingo Family has turned them into works of art with his power and taken over the Thousand Sunny. Chopper and Brook ensure that Jora\u0027s attacks are aimed at them, not their boat. However, Doflamingo\u0027s accomplice uses her abilities to turn the Sunny into a work of art. She succeeds and announces that the Crew of the Straw Hat can never leave Dressrosa again, and that their aim is to deliver Kinemon\u0027s son to his young master.\nMeanwhile, at the Coliseum Corrida, gladiator Ricky wants to leave and refuses to be treated by the doctors. Rebecca, for her part, advises him to cooperate, but he stubbornly refuses and leaves the Colosseum while Rebecca recalls her childhood memories. At the same time, in a waiting room belonging to the Doflamingo Family, Bellamy, who is being treated, explains to Diamante that Luffy is also taking part in the tournament, but under a false name. He then receives a letter from Joker ordering him to kill the Straw Hat. Diamante explains that Doflamingo is being too lenient, giving Bellamy one more chance to become part of the Doflamingo Family. But the former captain of the New Age Crew is reluctant because of the encouragement given to him by the Straw Hat during the Battle Royale of Block B, in which he took part.\nNearby, Bartolomeo makes his way to Cavendish\u0027s dressing room, telling him he\u0027d heard he was stalking Lucy. While dining, the noble pirate congratulated him on his victory, and as far as the man was concerned, it was none of his business. Bartolomeo warned him that he wouldn\u0027t let him be killed. Cavendish laughed and said that Lucy was indeed his prey.\nMeanwhile, in the ring, Coliseum Corrida\u0027s star commentator Gats explains to the massed spectators that the Battle of Block C is heating up to the point of excitement. Among the combatants is a giant by the name of Hajrudin, who atomizes all his opponents in his path, much to the delight of the Fighting Pisces swarming around the ring. His devastating punches are reminiscent of lightning and thunder, and he boasts that he will one day become king of the giants by eating the Mera Mera no Mi. But among his opponents is Fighting Bull, who had already defeated 21 death row inmates and was tamed by Lucy. This act of courage has made the young gladiator the darling of the public, further enraging Cavendish, who harbors a bitter hatred for him, much to the astonishment of Rebecca, who is at his side. Thanks to Ucy, Luffy\u0027s name for the Fighting Bull, they defeat several gladiators together, but collide head-on with Hajrudin. Enraged, the giant attacks them and crushes them like pancakes. Ucy is knocked out and Luffy is crushed, but the latter quickly gets up to see the state of his friend. Seeing him in such a bad way, the young pirate becomes furious. Filled with rage, he leaps into the air and delivers a Haki-enhanced Jet Pistol to Hajrudin, who collapses heavily onto the other opponents...",

        "description": "Gats is surprised to announce that Hajrudin, one of the tournament favorites, has been eliminated by the mysterious gladiator Lucy. The crowd, surprised by this unexpected event, begins to applaud the valiant victor. Meanwhile, Luffy helps Ucy to his feet after the Fighting Bull\u0027s attack, then leads him out of the ring. In the VIP box, Cavendish, who is enjoying a meal, is unimpressed by Luffy\u0027s power, while Bartolomeo, who is standing next to him, enjoyed the fight. Rebecca, for her part, is shocked by Luffy\u0027s show of strength in taking down the giant.\nIn the ring, Ideo walks up to Hajrudin and tells him that the ring is no place to take a nap. He throws an explosive punch that literally sends Hajrudin to the stands. Gats is surprised by Ideo\u0027s explosive blows, which is why this astonishing fighter is nicknamed the \u0022Destroyer Cannon\u0022.\nAt the same time, in the capital of Dressrosa, Zoro continues to run in the direction of the Field of Flowers in the company of Wicca, who guides him, not without giving him a lecture, so as not to get lost in the city\u0027s alleyways. Weary of his complaints, the swordsman abandons him and continues on his way alone. Distraught, Wicca remains alone and weeps, lamenting the future fate of her companions. But Zoro retraces his steps and, still lost, takes the young dwarf who this time guides him correctly to the Field of Flowers.\nNot far away, on Green Bit, the confrontation between Doflamingo, Fujitora and Law becomes inevitable. Still perched on his column, the Navy Admiral kicks off the festivities, using his power to send a new meteorite ready to split at his enemies. But Trafalgar Law neutralizes his attack using his gifts. Using his saber, he cuts the bolide in half and it sinks into the waves around the island. Now it\u0027s Doflamingo\u0027s turn to attack his rival. Law dodges the Shichibukai\u0027s attacks as best he can, and manages to leave the crater where he was with Fujitora and Doflamingo. Rushing headlong into the island\u0027s jungle, he tries to lose his pursuer. Issho, for his part, gives chase to the two pirates with the help of his men. Trafalgar Law\u0027s situation becomes worrying, as Doflamingo is still hot on his heels. Soon, however, he is no match for his attackers and finds himself surrounded by his hereditary enemy on the one hand, and by naval soldiers led by Fujitora on the other.\nBack to the Colis\u00e9e Corrida. Gats announces to a cheering crowd the forthcoming fight between Ideo and Lucy. While fighting him, Ideo declares that he wishes to seize the Pyro-Fruit to become the strongest. But Lucy disagrees with him and makes him understand by bravely facing his blows. Gats is stunned by the spectacle. He suddenly turns his attention to the three fighters from the Land of Ka, Sai, Boo and Don Chinjao, who continue to strike down their opponents with disconcerting ease. Alone, Jean Ango remains standing in the ring and takes advantage of the situation to steal the weapons of the defeated gladiators. He is soon joined by the Funk Brothers, who are still in contention to win the tournament. But Kerry Funk has a run-in with Boo, who gives him a severe beating. \u0022Threaded onto the giant body of his younger brother, Bobby Funk, who has eaten the Jake Jake no Mi, Kerry manages to get his revenge, knocking out Boo, one of the three fighters from the Land of Ka.\nDuring his fight against Ideo, Luffy loses his helmet and, fearing recognition, tries to get it back after draping his famous Straw Hat with his cape. But bounty hunter Jean Ango has the precious item in his possession. Angered, Lucy learns from him that he is a wanted man. Meanwhile, Don Chinjao continues to wreak havoc in the ring, desperate to eliminate Garp\u0027s grandson, his greatest enemy, once and for all. Just as they are about to face off, Garts announces to all present that there are only forty fighters left to compete for victory in the Battle Royale of Block C...",

For his part, Chinjao sends Xai to fight him, to make them pay for the audacity of having defeated Boo, while he pursues Luffy, for whom he has a score to settle. Luffy tries to catch up with Jean Ango, who had stolen his helmet, but the Straw Hat realizes too late that Don Chinjao is on his trail, shouting his grandfather\u0027s name. But in the course of the battle, Lucy loses her fake beard, which threatens to reveal her true identity. Fighting with all his might to remain anonymous, he dodges the dozens of daggers thrown at him by Jean Ango to stop him.\nMeanwhile, in the ring, a surviving gladiator saw what had happened to the Funk Brothers. He discovered that Kerry Funk had eaten the Jake Jake no Mi that allows him to take over his brother\u0027s body and use it as a second skin, sweeping away his personality and using his cruelty and fighting spirit with Bobby\u0027s robust body. Armed with this power, the Funk Brothers easily beat Boo, much to the chagrin of Xai, who can\u0027t stifle his anger. Nevertheless, he managed to avenge his comrade\u0027s defeat by beating Kerry with a single heel strike using the strength of Hasshoken. At the top of the rostrum, Gats is ecstatic, admiring Xai\u0027s prowess in the art of combat.\nWhile Lucy desperately searches for Jean Ango to retrieve her helmet, Ideo appears and challenges Xai, who has just beaten the Funk Brothers, to a duel. The fight promises to be an arduous one, as both fighters are determined to seize the Mera Mera no Mi. Not far away, near Dressrosa, Nami and Momonosuke try to lose Jora\u0027s men using his waver. They are soon joined by Brook and Chopper, who create a diversion using Sunny\u0027s pocket submarine. Using the power of her weather wand, Nami manages to generate a storm that pulverizes the Doflamingo Family\u0027s submarine, much to Jora\u0027s dismay as he broods over his revenge.\nAt the same time, at the Coliseum Corrida, Luffy has to face Jean Ango, who has become a huge mass of weapons and swords ready to fall on him. While hurling projectiles at Luffy, the bounty hunter tells him that he\u0027s gone in search of all the escapees who escaped from Impel Down with the Straw Hat, including Baggy, Jinbe, Crocodile, Emporio Ivankov and Shiliew. He doesn\u0027t have time to finish his sentence when he spots Don Chinjao behind Luffy. Chinjao gets rid of him with a violent headbutt that ejects Jean Ango from the ring after Luffy has had time to retrieve his precious helmet.\nNot far away, at the other end of the ring, Xai and Ideo duel, showing everyone that they\u0027re just as strong as each other. Eager to start their own duel and settle the score, Luffy and Chinjao brutally interrupt the two gladiators\u0027 fight by ejecting each other from the ring, provoking the excitement of the audience, Cavendish, Bartolomeo and Rebecca, who realize that there are only two fighters left in the C Block Battle Royale, each with the ability to use the Haki of Kings: Lucy (aka Luffy) and Don Chinjao...",

        "description": "A fierce battle ensues between Luffy and Don Chinjao. The latter learns that Rayleigh had taught the young pirate to use the Haki of Kings. Suddenly, the 12th commander of the Happou Fleet begins to weep as he recalls the memory of a lost treasure, before furiously attacking Luffy for being the grandson of Garp, his sworn enemy. At the same time, Sanji and Kinemon, in disguise, are in the streets of the city, watching the battle on the big screen. They soon discover Navy soldiers, led by Vice-Admiral Bastille, eagerly awaiting the exit of the defeated from the Colis\u00e9e Corrida. But time is of the essence, as Sanji and Kinemon must get to the House of Toys immediately to rescue Kanjuro, who is being held prisoner there. Meanwhile, Soldier Lightning Fury explains to Franky that there are two laws instituted by Doflamingo when he ascended to the throne of Dressrosa ten years ago. The first is a curfew that forces humans and toys to return to their homes at precisely midnight. The second is that humans must not enter toys\u0027 homes, and vice versa. The tragedy, however, is that not everyone in Dressrosa knows that the toys were once flesh-and-blood beings transformed into toys by a strange curse. Soldier Lightning Fury reveals to Franky that a mysterious Demon Fruit user has been brought to Dressrosa on Doflamingo\u0027s orders and has metamorphosed some of the island\u0027s inhabitants, while causing the other to lose his memory. This news comes as a surprise to the carpenter of the Straw Hat Crew, who realizes that his new companion was once a human being! However, the Lightning Fury Soldier won\u0027t confide in him until they\u0027re both in the Field of Flowers.\nMeanwhile, at the Coliseum Corrida, Luffy\u0027s battle with Don Chinjao continues apace. The two fighters are of equal strength, and the confrontation promises to be long and bloody. Under the admiring gazes of his two grandsons, Sai and Boo, Chinjao tries to crush Luffy, who is much faster than he is. The former commander of the Happou Fleet confesses that he\u0027s going to avenge all the evil Garp did to him when, 30 years ago, he seized not only his fortune and treasure, but also his strength, which resided in his head, which is as hard as steel. Using an unstoppable fighting technique, Don Chinjao transforms himself into a giant top that sweeps away everything in its path. Luffy tries to thwart his plan, but to no avail. Don Chinjao is more determined than ever to avenge the outrage Garp has inflicted on him.\nNot far away, on Green Bit, Doflamingo continues to track Trafalgar Law through the island\u0027s jungle. The pirate tries to lose his pursuer, but the latter is tough. For his part, Issho throws rocks at him. Eventually, he throws another meteorite at him, which falls heavily on the island, causing a huge explosion. Law barely escapes with his life. While trying to save his life, Law tries to contact Nami, whom he believes to have stayed behind on the Sunny, by snail phone, but receives no reply. Meanwhile, on Green Bit, the dwarves are in a panic. Imploring the help of their new hero, Usoland, he explains that it is the power of his Haki that is causing the ground to shake. Leo reveals to Robin and Usopp that he wishes to rescue Princess Mansherry and 500 of her dwarf friends, who are being held prisoner in the Smile Factory beneath the Colosseum...",

The two members of the Straw Hat Crew use express foxes to travel through an underground passage linking Green Bit to Dressrosa, bypassing the dangerous iron bridge. Meanwhile, Soldier Lightning Fury and Franky enter the headquarters of \u0022King Riku\u0027s Army\u0022, located beneath the Field of Flowers, and meet the anti-Doflamingo coalition cheering their leader, none other than the Toy Soldier! It\u0027s in this secret lair that Franky meets up with Zoro, who is absorbed in Luffy\u0027s showdown with Don Chinjao. Despite Wicca\u0027s pleas for him to get back to his ship immediately, the swordsman is mesmerized by the fight taking place at the Coliseum Corrida, which is being broadcast on every screen on the island. Suddenly, Zoro realizes the danger facing the Sunny and decides to make his way to his ship before it\u0027s too late.\nAt the same time, in the Colis\u00e9e Corrida ring, the fight between Luffy and Chinjao reaches its climax.

        "description": "The battle between Luffy and Chinjao continues to rage inside the Colis\u00e9e Corrida. Soon both fighters are using the full power of their Haki to defeat the other. By the end of the fight, Luffy and Don Chinjao are exhausted. The Straw Hat compliments his opponent on his strength, which exasperates him. Not understanding what was happening to him, Chinjao began to tell him how Garp had stolen his \u0022strength\u0022. Thirty years ago, Chinjao\u0027s gang lived on a winter island continually covered in ice, and beneath this ice lay a fabulous treasure. The ice could only be broken with powerful head blows. One day, Chinjao got into a fight with Garp, Luffy\u0027s grandfather, who delivered a violent punch that deformed the skull of the future leader of the Ka Country Gang. This serious injury prevented him from ever tapping the ice to break it, thus rendering the fabulous treasure inaccessible. Since that fateful day, Chinjao has vowed eternal hatred for Garp and all his descendants.\nDon Chinjao insults Luffy, telling him that Rayleigh had wasted his time trying to train him, and congratulates the Navy soldiers for executing Ace in Marineford. These hurtful words are enough to inflame the Straw Hat\u0027s blood, and he starts attacking him, with Chinjao following suit.\nLuffy prepares a Thor Elephant Gun to attack him, while Don Chinjao uses a headbutt to thwart his plan. The Straw Hat\u0027s assault is so swift that it hits his opponent\u0027s head full force. The effect of this attack is to return Chinjao\u0027s head to the way it was before Garp distorted it thirty years ago. By defeating Don Chinjao before the helpless eyes of his two grandsons, Boo and Xai, Luffy automatically wins Block C.

After Lucy returns to the locker room, Cavendish \u0022flips out\u0022 and attacks her with his Durandal sword. While they\u0027re fighting, Bartolomeo vividly remembers crossing paths with the Straw Hat in Loguetown, just as the latter was about to be beheaded by Baggy the Clown at the scene of Gol D.\u0027s execution. Roger\u0027s execution. From that day on, Bartolomeo became one of Luffy\u0027s biggest fans, following the young pirate and his crew\u0027s exploits in Alabasta, Enies Lobby, Impel Down and Marineford. Influenced by his idol, he decided to take the plunge and become a pirate himself.\nThe battle between Cavendish and Luffy continues unabated. The Straw Hat manages to block his attacker\u0027s sharp blade with his bare hands. Suddenly, the fight is interrupted by the arrival of Chinjao who, supported by his faithful grandsons Xai and Boo, warmly thanks Luffy for restoring his skull to its original shape. Fleeing Chinjao\u0027s warm-hearted outbursts and Cavendish\u0027s hatred of him, Luffy manages to lose them and reunites with Rebecca when they both come across Jesus Burgess. The latter is chatting quietly with Blackbeard on a snail phone. The Straw Hat and Riku\u0027s granddaughter learn that Burgess and Teach are planning to recruit Aokiji into their crew! Luffy, in his rage against Blackbeard, says no one will touch Ace\u0027s power, although Marshall D. Teach says Burgess will win the tournament because he\u0027s the strongest.\nTo calm her nerves, Rebecca takes the Straw Hat to a quieter spot where gladiators usually go to rest and offers Lucy a hearty bent\u014d. The young gladiator is impressed by the strength her friend has shown in winning the Battle Royale of Block C. Suddenly Rebecca changes face and sets a trap for Lucy, who is unwillingly immobilized by an imprisoned gladiator. While continuing to eat, the Straw Hat manages to foil her plan, but he doesn\u0027t hold it against her. Indeed, Luffy\u0027s motto is never to take revenge on someone who has offered him something to eat. Impressed by Luffy\u0027s prowess, the imprisoned gladiators explain to him that Coliseum battles were not originally lethal, while Rebecca reveals her plan to Luffy: win the Coliseum Corrida tournament in order to win the Mera Mera no Mi, which will be used to eliminate Doflamingo and his tyranny once and for all...",

This one-legged tin soldier was once her guardian when the young woman\u0027s mother died. He raised her throughout her childhood. But an announcement from Gats immediately brings the young woman back to reality, informing the participants of the D Block Battle Royale that the ring was operational again. Rebecca sets off to fight, leaving Luffy with the imprisoned gladiators.\nAs she makes her way to the ring, where other D Block fighters are already present, Rebecca remembers her past as a little girl. As a little girl, she helped her mother Scarlett sell flowers to support herself. When they learn that the soldiers of the Riku kingdom have plundered their own country, they decide to flee, and are helped by Soldier Lightning Fury. Unfortunately, Scarlett loses her life while trying to find food for Rebecca. This death causes great grief to Soldier Lightning Fury, who vows to protect the daughter of the woman he failed to save, no matter what. Just then, Doflamingo arrives to seize the throne, making Riku, the former sovereign, the most hated man in Dressrosa. Over the years, the tin soldier has done his best to protect Rebecca, so much so that a bounty for his capture was placed on his head after he freed the little girl from the clutches of two slave traders who wanted to sell her. Behaving like a father to her, Soldier Lightning Fury taught Rebecca how to fight to protect herself.\nBack to the present: Rebecca is in the Colosseum corridor, facing the ring. She thinks back to the words she\u0027d spoken to Soldier Lightning Fury, when she told him \u0022You\u0027ll always be by my side...\u0022 \u0022You\u0027ll always protect me...\u0022. Gats, the tournament commentator, introduces the gladiatrix as the \u0022beautiful swordswoman of the Colosseum\u0022 and even refers to her as the \u0022Phantom Princess\u0022. Rebecca advances, asking the Toy Soldier not to die. Before fighting, she promises not to lose in front of an audience enraged by the sight of the young gladiatrix. Much to Luffy\u0027s surprise, she is booed off the stage by both the gladiators and the audience. Rebecca cries and the Straw Hat discovers how much Rebecca is hated by the Colosseum crowd. He also realizes how much Rebecca\u0027s grandfather, the former King Riku, was hated by everyone in this country...",

The young gladiator thanks him, but \u0022the Magnificent Pirate Captain\u0022 reminds her that they are both enemies. Gats kicks off the Battle Royale of Block D, which begins after ringing the gong with 137 competitors ready to fight to the death in the Colosseum arena.\nMeanwhile, on Green Bit, Doflamingo continues to chase Trafalgar Law through the island\u0027s jungle, decimating every tree in his path. Law, exhausted, faces his adversary. He immediately guessed who he was up against: a former Celestial Dragon! Doflamingo doesn\u0027t seem surprised by his discovery and continues to attack him using his powers. He finally captures him by tying him firmly to the trunk of a tree. Doflamingo orders him to give him Caesar Clown\u0027s heart, but the latter refuses after realizing that Punk Hazard\u0027s former master was the only one capable of providing him with Smiles. Without these precious Demon Fruits, Kaidou, one of the Four Emperors, would attack Doflamingo and kill him on the spot. Using the powers of Ope Ope no Mi, Law manages to outwit Doflamingo. But Doflamingo quickly catches up with him before fighting him. Just as he is about to deliver the final blow, he is rudely interrupted by Fujitora, who orders him to spare him. Indeed, the Navy Admiral wishes to arrest this Pirate Captain rather than see him dead. Doflamingo submits to Fujitora, but not before taking back Caesar\u0027s heart from Law.\nNot far away, Leo and his airborne troops from the Kingdom of Tontatta, accompanied by Robin and Usopp, arrive at the secret base of the Field of Flowers. There, Leo and Private Lightning Fury deliver their speech to their men, preparing them for the battle ahead. Meanwhile in Dressrosa, Zoro, with Wicca\u0027s help, tries to find his way back to Nami and the others aboard the Thousand Sunny, but is noticed by Kinemon and Sanji, who call out to him in the distance. The swordsman tells them of the danger facing the Sunny\u0027s crew when Violette appears around the corner. The young woman informs them that their ship has already been captured by Jora and is now on its way to Green Bit.\nAt the same time, Gats announces to the crowd at the Colis\u00e9e Corrida that the Battle Royale for Block D has begun. Rebecca becomes the target of five fierce gladiators, whom she quickly disposes of using her great fencing skills. All the while keeping in mind her desire to win the tournament and seize the Mera Mera no Mi to annihilate Doflamingo once and for all, and remembering the advice given to her by Soldier Lightning Fury in her youth. She triumphed over her five opponents. The young gladiatrix doesn\u0027t stop there, and is more motivated than ever to fight to the bitter end...",

He then reveals to his defeated opponent that the royal family that ruled Dressrosa before the Riku family was none other than the Don Quixote family. Law now realizes that he\u0027s up against a Celestial Dragon!\nMeanwhile, aboard the deformed Thousand Sunny, Brook nonchalantly advises Jora to make abstract art, while she turns Nami, Chopper and Momonosuke into works of art and threatens them with death. However, Jora is tricked by the living skeleton after restoring Brook\u0027s cane and violin to their original forms. Once their enemy is defeated, her spell is broken and everyone, including the ship, returns to their normal appearance.\nOn Dressrosa, in front of the locked gates of the Coliseum Corrida, Zoro, Wicca and Kinemon try to enter to find Luffy, while Sanji decides to rescue Nami and the others aboard the Sunny with Violette\u0027s help. As they wonder how they\u0027ll get into the circus, Bartolomeo notices them. Bartolomeo remembers Zoro\u0027s exploits and can\u0027t help but burst into tears at the sight of him. At the same time, Luffy enthusiastically follows Rebecca\u0027s progress in the D Block Battle Royale, cheering her on loudly.\nHeading for Green Bit, Nami, Chopper and Momonosuke are overjoyed to have regained their original appearance and thank Brook for delivering them from Jora\u0027s power. Just as they\u0027re about to handcuff her in Sea Granite to annihilate the powers of her Demon Fruit, Doflamingo\u0027s subordinate stands up. She is very angry with Brook for betraying her and, in revenge, transforms herself into a gigantic monster ready to annihilate them.\nMeanwhile, at the Royal Palace in Dressrosa, Baby 5 discusses Violette\u0027s betrayal with Gladius, one of Pica\u0027s subordinates, who is clearly not very happy with the traitor because she didn\u0027t follow the plan. Indeed, northeast of Dressrosa, Sanji and Violette are riding a toy horse towards Green Bit, which is just around the corner. Violette advises Sanji that he and his friends should change their rendezvous point, since the port of Acacia has welcomed four ships and over 3,000 navy troops. The cook of the Chapeau de Paille crew is impressed by the young woman\u0027s power to know in advance everything that will happen within a radius of 4,000 kilometers. Unfortunately, she can\u0027t see where the Sunny is at the moment. Indeed, the Straw Hat ship is battling with Jora, who wants to make them pay. Nami tries to counterattack using her Climat Tact, but to no avail. However, she is saved in extremis by Brook, who tries to confront Doflamingo\u0027s subordinate head-on. The latter doesn\u0027t give in and tries to immobilize her attacker. Nami takes the opportunity to activate the Groar Canon with Chopper\u0027s help. The effect is immediate, pulverizing Jora\u0027s work of art in the blink of an eye. But Jora has not said her last word. But it\u0027s not to her liking, as she is knocked unconscious by Momonosuke and struck down by Nami.

Nami doesn\u0027t know what to do with her, except to tie her up with sea-granite chains to keep her out of further trouble. Remembering Law\u0027s words, the Straw Hats decide to set sail for Green Bit to retrieve Caesar Clown, who was due to be handed over to Doflamingo. Jora informs them that his master has never abdicated the rank of Shichibukai. This news terrifies Chopper and his friends, especially when they learn that the rest of the Straw Hat Crew is probably in the hands of the Donquichotte Family.\nMeanwhile, at the Colis\u00e9e Corrida, the Battle Royale of Block D continues to rage. Gats, at the peak of his powers, introduces the audience to the personalities who have come to compete. First there\u0027s a notorious war criminal by the name of Suleyman the Beheader. Then comes the \u0022Overseer\u0022 Orombus, adventurer and admiral of the great Yonte Maria Fleet. Then there\u0027s Rolling Logan, captain of the army of the Kingdom of Majiatsuka, Agyou, a fighting lion, Damask, the pyromaniac, Mummy the Sorcerer, Acilia, a fearsome gladiator, not forgetting Cavendish on the White Horse, the tournament favorite. First, Cavendish must face Gardoa, the magnificent bounty hunter. To silence this young white boy, Cavendish uses his sword Durandal to defeat him, and succeeds with disconcerting ease. Cheered on by the audience, Cavendish boasts, making Rebecca forget all about him as she continues to fight for her life. Luffy follows her attentively on the screen installed in the dungeon of the imprisoned gladiators. The young woman dodges all her opponents\u0027 attacks with the utmost agility, while other tournament participants try to beat her.\nNot far away, on Green Bit, Trafalgar Law is still the prisoner of Fujitora and Doflamingo. He\u0027s still reeling from the news that his worst enemy is a Celestial Dragon! Just as the latter was about to try something against Luffy\u0027s companions left behind in Dressrosa, Caesar Clown, still handcuffed, appears and asks his young master to return the heart Law had taken from him. But this was in fact a decoy, as the heart Doflamingo has in his possession is in fact that of a naval soldier, who is writhing in pain after the King of Dressrosa begins triturating the stolen organ. Fujitora doesn\u0027t like this treatment and makes him understand. Taking advantage of a moment\u0027s inattention on the part of his jailers, Law uses the powers of his Demon Fruit to escape Fujitora\u0027s \u0022gravity\u0022 and succeeds in recapturing Caesar Clown.\nThe Shichibukai manages to dodge all of Doflamingo\u0027s attacks through the jungle, while Sunny comes within sight of the island. Chopper scans the shoreline with binoculars, looking for Trafalgar Law. Suddenly, a school of Fighting Fish emerges from the water and attacks Luffy\u0027s ship. As Nami, Brook, Chopper and Momonosuke face this new ordeal, Law tries to lose his pursuer while taking Caesar with him. He then hatches a plan which, if all goes well, could well succeed: to reach the bridge linking Green Bit and Dressrosa, so as to put his prisoner on the boat while he stays there to face his adversary more easily. The ultimate aim of this plan is to enable Sunny to quickly get away from the shores of Green Bit. Suddenly, Doflamingo stopped pursuing Law when he spotted the Straw Hat ship battling with the Fighting Fish. Soaring into the air, the ruler of Dressrosa begins his attack, with Law powerless to stop him. Helplessly, Law sees Doflamingo fly off to destroy his precious allies, when suddenly Sanji appears and, with a leap, manages to deflect his adversary\u0027s attack before engaging in a perilous battle with him...",

        "description": "Sanji battles valiantly against Doflamingo, but is finally defeated by the latter. Before Doflamingo can deliver the final blow, Sanji is saved in extremis by Trafalgar Law, who teleports with him aboard the Thousand Sunny using his power. Now that Caesar Clown is back under his control, Law orders the Straw Hats to sail for Zou, where his crew is.\nReluctant to abandon their friends on Dressrosa, Nami and her companions are forced to accept Law\u0027s proposal when they are attacked by a Navy warship, commanded by Fujitora, and Doflamingo. The Admiral orders the Sunny to be fired upon as he hurls two huge meteorites at her. Law avoids disaster by using his power to deflect the two projectiles, which smash against the warship\u0027s imposing hull. Panic-stricken, the soldiers call for help from their commander, who orders them to leave immediately for Dressrosa.\nMeanwhile, the crew of the Chapeau de Paille are still trying to escape Doflamingo\u0027s relentless attacks. Trafalgar Law reveals that Doflamingo can\u0027t catch up with them in cloudless areas with his power, and advises them to quickly find a way to outrun their pursuer. Sanji understands better what\u0027s going on when he learns that Doflamingo has mastered the wires, and Law jumps ship at this point, capturing Jora and joining Joker on the bridge linking Green Bit to Dressrosa. The Straw Hats then flee with a violent \u0022Burst Blast\u0022.\nAt the same time, on the outskirts of the Coliseum Corrida, Zoro, in the company of Kinemon, calls out to Bartolomeo, who can\u0027t help crying at the sight of his idol. He asks him if there\u0027s another way into the building, as all the doors are closed. Hearing Luffy and Zoro\u0027s names, Kinemon is amazed that their interlocutor knows their true identities.\nMeanwhile, in the Colosseum arena, the Battle Royale of Block D continues to rage. All the participants are fighting like lions to emerge victorious from this tournament. Cavendish eliminates his opponents one by one, as does Rebecca, who fights valiantly under the astonished eyes of Gats. The young gladiatrix\u0027s fighting technique also attracts Cavendish\u0027s attention, and he can\u0027t understand why she doesn\u0027t attack. All she does is dodge her attackers. But the Horseman on the White Horse is having a hard time with Acilia, who is determined to get rid of him. Suddenly, three imposing warriors force Rebecca back to the edge of the fighting fish-infested pool. To the booing of the public, her three adversaries launch themselves at her, but Rebecca, with disconcerting ease, manages to deflect their blows and throw them into the pool before the stunned eyes of Cavendish and Luffy, who hasn\u0027t lost a step in the fight!\nFar away, several miles from Dressrosa, the Sunny sails as quickly as possible to outrun Doflamingo in cloud-free zones. Sanji takes advantage of this respite to communicate with Usopp by snail phone and explain the change of plan decided by Trafalgar Law. His friend is anxious to leave the island, as the climate is unhealthy. However, Franky, who is standing next to him, swears to destroy the Smile Factory come what may, while Sanji informs them that Zoro and Kinemon have gone to tell Luffy what\u0027s going on. He also explains that Law has left the ship with Jora to confront Doflamingo on the bridge linking Green Bit to Dressrosa. Doflamingo doesn\u0027t understand Law\u0027s motives, as he\u0027s letting half the Straw Hats go while he stays behind as if to sacrifice himself. Doflamingo reminds the Shichibukai that the other half of Luffy\u0027s crew are still in Dressrosa and that he could very well take them hostage in order to get Caesar back. Law then tells him that a lot of people have bitten their fingers off by underestimating them, and immediately puts an end to the alliance he had created with Luffy a few days earlier. Indeed, Law explains that he had been using the Straw Hat Pirates from the start with the sole aim of destroying Doflamingo\u0027s Smiles production. He also confesses that even if he doesn\u0027t succeed in killing him, the mere fact of destroying his Smiles production will provoke Kaidou\u0027s wrath, and he will personally want Doflamingo dead. He concludes by announcing that he would have loved to see the chaos that Joker\u0027s death would bring to the whole world, but all he cares about now is making him pay for all the misdeeds he committed thirteen years ago...",

Law asserts that the reason he wants to take revenge on Doflamingo is not personal, but to avenge someone he once loved. Following this revelation, the fight between Doflamingo and Law begins with a bang.\nAt the same time, off Dressrosa, the Thousand Sunny leaves these inhospitable shores to sail towards Zou. All aboard are happy to have escaped Doflamingo, even if they\u0027re a little uneasy about leaving their friends on the island. Sanji informs his comrades that Robin is safe with Franky and Usopp before comforting Momonosuke, who had turned back into a dragon. The Straw Hat Crew\u0027s cook discovers that Kinemon\u0027s son had already seen Doflamingo at work when he was in Dressrosa with his father and Kanjuro, who is still being held prisoner on the island. As Momonosuke laments his friend\u0027s fate, Sanji thinks back fondly to the last moments he spent with Violette before leaving to rescue his friends. He remembers her words. She had asked him not to worry about her, as she was under the protection of the World Government.\nOn Dressrosa, Violette gallops at full speed towards the Royal Palace of Dressrosa. Along the way, she spots a giant screen broadcasting Rebecca\u0027s fight in the Colis\u00e9e Corrida. Seeing the hatred the spectators have for the young gladiatrix, the beautiful flamenco dancer destroys the giant screen with a pistol shot before continuing on her way.\nAt the same time, in the Coliseum Corrida, Bartolomeo, who knows that Luffy is taking part in the tournament under the name of Lucy, promises Zoro to help him find the Straw Hat in exchange for an autograph. Meanwhile, the D Block Battle Royale is in full swing. Fierce competitors clash fiercely and the others are eliminated one by one! While Cavendish takes down yet another gladiator with a vengeance, Rolling Logan, military commander of the Southern Kingdom of Majiatsuka, enters the fray. He easily overcomes his opponent using his astonishing fighting techniques, while Gats looks on in amazement. His attention is suddenly drawn to Rebecca, who is under renewed attack. But the young gladiatrix demonstrates her agility and her ability to use Observation Haki, knocking out a number of opponents in the process. Suddenly, Rolling Logan notices Rebecca\u0027s presence and advances to attack her. Luffy, in disguise, anxiously follows what happens next...",

He thinks the other members of the Straw Hat Crew are also in Dressrosa, and hopes to meet them in the flesh. Suddenly, his attention is drawn to a strange staircase that leads him into the dark basement of the huge arena. He soon hears noises and discovers that the fighters, who had lost their bouts, were being brought there for treatment. The Colosseum staff ask him to leave, so as not to incur the wrath of the defeated fighters. Understandably, he leaves just as Xai, who is looking for his grandfather, is summoned by the nurses to be treated. But instead, he falls into a trap and is sent to the Colosseum\u0027s foundations, which resemble a huge prison, where he finds his relative and the other gladiators who have lost their battle.\nMeanwhile, in the Colosseum Corrida arena, the Battle Royale of Block D continues apace. All participants fight like lions in front of an audience happy to admire such warriors. Gats is excited to announce that Rolling Logan has decided to fight Rebecca, who has been undefeated since the start of the tournament. Provoking the crowd to ensure that his future victim is defeated quickly, Rolling Logan receives an immeasurable popularity which irritates Luffy, who can\u0027t understand why everyone in Dressrosa hates Rebecca so much. The Straw Hat thinks the young woman is a good person. The prisoners he\u0027s with also agree, and one of them even tries to explain to him why Rebecca is so unpopular. But Luffy is too engrossed in the beautiful gladiatrix\u0027s battle to hear her story.\nIn the Coliseum Corrida ring, Rolling Logan starts attacking Rebecca, who dodges his blows as best she can. She then tries to flee, but is quickly caught by her opponent, who has the knack of anticipating her every move in order to trap her. Trapped, the young gladiatrix has no escape but to jump into the fighting fish-infested pool. But she doesn\u0027t. Suddenly, Rolling Logan\u0027s attention is drawn to another fighter who had taken advantage of the situation to attack him from behind. He grabs him and crushes him in his powerful hand as if he were a common insect. Witnessing the scene, Rebecca fled to avoid being her opponent\u0027s next victim, immediately provoking the public\u0027s displeasure as they discovered the young gladiatrix\u0027s cowardice. Rolling Logan chases after her, knocking down other opponents in her path. Suddenly, Rebecca is stopped in her tracks by a fighter who has just been defeated, and loses her precious sword. Her pursuer takes advantage of her disadvantage to grab her. Rebecca struggles as hard as she can, but is eventually caught and passes out. Drunk with power, Rolling Logan takes the young gladiatrix between his fingers. The entire Coliseum Corrida audience witnesses Rebecca\u0027s defeat, and exults in joy under the admiring gaze of Gats, who is commentating on the tournament.\nRebecca is now at Rolling Logan\u0027s mercy. She regains consciousness and realizes she can no longer escape him. He begins to clamp his fingers on her, crushing her bones. Rebecca lets out a huge cry of pain that excites her adversary. The situation displeases Luffy and his fellow prisoners. As Rebecca succumbs to Rolling Logan\u0027s onslaught, she remembers her training with Soldier Lightning Fury. Just as she was about to die, Acilia intervenes to attack Rolling Logan, who drops his victim to the ground. The latter gets up and witnesses the titanic battle between her former adversary and the warrior who had saved her life. Picking up her sword, the young gladiatrix thanks her for her gesture. Acilia graces their new friendship with a broad smile before attacking Rolling Logan. The latter, very upset by the warrior\u0027s attitude, easily overcomes her. Seeing her new friend in a bad way, Rebecca decides to help her and attacks Rolling Logan for the first time, who loses his balance under the weight of this assault and ends up in the Fighting Fish-infested pool before the stunned eyes of the crowd and Gats, who can\u0027t believe this turn of events. To the booing of the Colosseum spectators, Acilia congratulates Rebecca on her success in defeating their opponent and advises her to go all the way to the final to win the prize. To achieve this, she even helps her beat the other tournament participants who had ganged up against her. Rebecca continues to fight like a lioness under the admiring eyes of Luffy and the prisoner warriors, who are delighted that their champion is still in the tournament. Wanting to get a closer look at the fight, Luffy abandons his companions to return to the surface and, on the way, meets Bartolomeo who immediately recognizes him, despite his disguise...",

Bartolomeo is overjoyed to finally meet his idol, but the Straw Hat couldn\u0027t care less and continues on his way. However, he is stopped by the winner of Block B and has to talk to him to find out what he wants.\nMeanwhile, many defeated gladiators land in the basement of the Coliseum Corrida. Among them are Boo, Ideo and the Funk Brothers, who are thrown into a pit filled with toys in the company of other unlucky warriors. Former king Riku is astonished to find an old underground dump beneath the Colosseum. Meanwhile, Tank Lepanto, one of the commanders of Dressrosa\u0027s former royal army, believes he recognizes former King Riku Dold III among the gladiators. All the gladiators are astonished when they hear this news. Indeed, Riku was the former ruler of Dressrosa before he was dethroned by Doflamingo, but he was also Rebecca\u0027s grandfather, who is still competing in the D Block Battle Royale.\nAt the same time, the king of the kingdom of Prodense, Elizabello II, who was defeated by Bartolomeo during the Block B tournament, is happy to be reunited with King Riku, who had saved Prodense several times in the past. With this support, hope is reborn in the former king\u0027s heart. Suddenly, the toys in the dump begin to rise and bow to the former ruler of Dressrosa. It is then discovered that they were all part of the former royal army. In the shadows, Hack, also defeated, communicates by snail phone with a mysterious stranger outside the Colosseum, confirming his suspicions about this strange basement.\nSuddenly, without warning, a mysterious slimy mass seizes Xai and carries him away. Boo and Don Chinjao rush to his rescue. Despite their combined efforts, their comrade is sucked into a hole. When he regains consciousness, Xai finds himself stretched out on a bed and bound by the slimy mass. He soon sees Trebol appear before him, immediately turning him into a toy. After ordering him not to harm humans and to follow the Donquichotte Family\u0027s orders without flinching, he commands him to go to the Smile Factory and the Trading Port to work.\nNot far away, on the Field of Flowers, the headquarters of King Riku\u0027s army, Gancho explains to Usopp, Robin and Franky that the Dwarves once took to the sea in search of resources their country could not produce. One day, a certain Donquichotte proposed a treaty with the Dwarves so that the men would stop attacking them. The Dwarves accepted, and a new era of slavery began. This dark era ended when King Riku came to power 800 years ago, at the end of the Lost Century. The dwarves and the Riku family forged a lasting relationship during this period. However, Gancho confesses that 10 years ago, when Doflamingo regained power, he tried to institute the same diabolical policies as his ancestors and had 500 Dwarves, including Gancho\u0027s granddaughter Princess Mansherry, locked up in his prison gaols. Suddenly, the attention of the three members of the Straw Hat Crew is drawn to a television monitor broadcasting the Battle Royale of Block D. They see Rebecca fighting with numerous gladiators. Robin takes advantage of the situation to ask the Lightning-Fury Soldier with them if the gladiator fighting in the Colosseum is really King Riku\u0027s granddaughter. The Toy Soldier replies that she is, before telling her about his past and revealing that he is Rebecca\u0027s real father...",

        "description": "Still reeling from meeting his idol, Bartolomeo calls out to Luffy by name. The Straw Hat, astonished that anyone would recognize him despite his disguise, stops running and heads towards his curious admirer, who informs him that Zoro wishes to see him. Overjoyed, the winner of the Battle Royale of Block B leads Luffy to the swordsman. At the same time, in the Colis\u00e9e Corrida ring, the D Block battle continues apace. Rebecca, allied with Acilia, fights to stay in the tournament. More and more of her opponents are trying to topple her into the pond surrounding the ring, which is infested with Fighting Fish.\nNot far away, in the Field of Flowers, Soldier Lightning Fury has confessed that he is Rebecca\u0027s real father. He explained to Usopp, Robin and Franky, present at the Dwarf Headquarters, how King Riku had lost the throne and the respect of the citizens of Dressrosa. Ten years ago, Doflamingo appeared at the king\u0027s home to reclaim his throne and country. If Riku didn\u0027t obey him, Dressrosa would suffer serious consequences. To avoid this, Doflamingo asked Riku for 10 billion Berrys to sell him Dressrosa. Not wanting to see his people perish at the hands of the Shichibukai, Riku sent his soldiers to collect the money from the citizens to save his country. They willingly deposited everything they owned, because they trusted their sovereign. But suddenly, everything changed. Doflamingo used the power of Ito Ito no Mi and controlled King Riku and his subordinates to attack and massacre the people against their will, as if they were puppets in the hands of the Shichibukai...",

Through Mone, who had betrayed her trust by posing as a simple servant, she watches helplessly as Don Quixote\u0027s crew, Doflamingo, enter the Royal Palace. In the face of the incomprehension and agony of the people of Dressrosa, the man who is to become the country\u0027s new king appears, the improvised hero Doflamingo, accompanied by his three most loyal lieutenants: Pica, Trebol and Diamante. King Riku is defeated and peace is restored to Dressrosa. Doflamingo is appointed the kingdom\u0027s new sovereign.\nBack to the present. At the Coliseum Corrida, Rebecca continues to endure the attacks of her opponents, under the insults of the public who had not forgotten King Riku\u0027s treachery towards his people ten years earlier. At the same time, the Lightning-Fury Soldier continues his story in front of Ussop, Robin, Franky and the Dwarves. The Toy Soldier is determined to inform his people of Doflamingo\u0027s true nature and his premeditated coup d\u0027\u00e9tat to clear King Riku, who was framed by him. He then confesses that Viola is the other name of Violette, the traitorous member of Don Quixote\u0027s crew Doflamingo, who had to work for the new king of Dressrosa in exchange for her father\u0027s life. Soldier Lightning Fury concludes his story by informing his new allies that the toys the Straw Hats had encountered on their arrival on the island were in fact dissident citizens, hostile to Doflamingo\u0027s policies and who hated him for turning them into toys.\nAt the same time, in the basement of the Colosseum, former King Riku discusses the past with Don Chinjao, while Boo, Abdullah and Jeet, transformed into toys by Sugar, slavishly head for the Smile Factory to work.

This man, who had been supported by Luffy during the tournament, seems to have malicious intentions towards him. Armed with a dagger, Bellamy is about to attack Luffy, but abruptly changes his mind. Cursing himself for having lost the opportunity to be admitted into the Doflamingo Family, he is approached by Dellinger, who mocks his incompetence in carrying out a direct order from his superior.\nMeanwhile, on the iron bridge linking Green Bit to Dressrosa, Trafalgar Law and Doflamingo continue their fierce battle, but Luffy\u0027s ally is no match for his adversary and quickly loses his fight with him. At the same time, Diamante calls her captain by snail phone to inform him of Violette\u0027s betrayal. Doflamingo orders his henchman to send Lao G to the entrance of the Smile Factory to prevent the Straw Hat Pirates from destroying it. After hanging up, the master of Dressrosa approaches Law to confess that he knew about his plan. Trafalgar Law, defeated though he was, laughed at his conqueror, who then inflicted a mortal blow...\nOutside the Coliseum Corrida, Luffy is delighted to have reunited with his companions. But his enthusiasm attracts the attention of a Navy soldier belonging to Vice-Admiral Bastille\u0027s company, who recognizes Zoro despite his disguise. He immediately reports his discovery to his superior, who suspects that Lucy is actually Luffy, captain of the Straw Hat Crew. However, he doesn\u0027t remember the missing gladiators Boo, Xai and Abdullah, who have been turned into toys by Sugar.\nAt the same time, the Straw Hats hold a summit meeting using snail phones and share their knowledge to date. Zoro and Kinemon inform Sanji that they have found Luffy. The Straw Hat Crew\u0027s cook, who is aboard the Sunny with Nami, Chopper, Brook, Momonosuke and their prisoners, Caesar Clown and Jora, decides to return to Dressrosa while Franky asks permission to help King Riku\u0027s Army revolution, knowing that Luffy would surely agree with him. His hunch was justified, as the Straw Hat unblinkingly supports the initiative taken by the crew\u0027s carpenter, much to the amazement of Usopp and Robin.\nAs Admiral Fujitora arrives on the banks of the Dressrosa with his men, he hears a great ruckus in the city, with explosions and buildings reduced to dust. He soon sees Law lying unconscious on the ground and Doflamingo standing on the ground just outside the Colosseum, close to where Zoro and Kinemon are standing. Satisfied to have finally defeated his opponent, Doflamingo pulls out a pistol and fires three shots at Law in front of Vice-Admiral Bastille, the people of Dressrosa and Luffy, who witness the scene...",

        "description": "As the members of the Straw Hat Crew, scattered across the kingdom, try to find out what\u0027s going on, Doflamingo addresses the citizens of Dressrosa. He apologizes for all the commotion, and explains that Law is solely responsible for the false news in the morning paper about the resignation of his privileges. Witnessing the scene, Luffy calls out to his adversary and asks why he shot his friend. The Grand Corsair replies that it\u0027s none of his business, and that all he\u0027s done is \u0022educate\u0022 his subordinate.\nSeeing their ally in a bad way, Zoro decides to intervene, while Kinemon takes charge of saving Law, informing their companions beforehand of what has just happened. But before the Marine soldiers can do anything to stop them, Admiral Fujitora appears, blocks Zoro\u0027s sword and sends him underground using his power. The samurai tries to rescue Zoro, but is struck down by Doflamingo, who has returned to the charge. Luffy, for his part, tries to help his friends, but is trapped in the bars of the Colis\u00e9e Corrida, which are forged from Sea Granite. Faced with this situation, Kinemon reveals to everyone that the man accompanying Doflamingo is none other than a Navy Admiral, news that shocks the other Straw Hats still free. At the same time, Zoro manages to free himself from the gravitational pull holding him captive and returns to the fight.\nSuddenly, Fujitora and Doflamingo soar above their opponents (thanks to their respective abilities), taking Law with them to the Royal Palace to finish their conversation. The Celestial Demon tells the Admiral that he can do whatever he likes with the Straw Hats, provided he lends a hand. Issho declares that he\u0027ll make a decision once they\u0027ve finished talking. The Navy troops decide to begin their assault to capture Kinemon and Zoro. Zoro tells Luffy that he must find the way out to save Law; the Straw Hat tells them that their ally is still alive, despite appearances.\nAt the same time, Zoro, Kinemon and Luffy hear the panicked cries of Sanji\u0027s group over the snail phone. The latter is being pursued by a strange ship whose prow is singing and staring at them. Brook and the others discover that the ship threatening them belongs to Big Mom\u0027s Crew!!!\nWhile Zoro manages to defeat his pursuers, his companions remaining on the Sunny catch sight of Pekoms and Tamago, two old acquaintances they met on Fishman\u0027s Island, intent on capturing Caesar Clown and sinking the Straw Hat ship!!! Punk Hazard\u0027s former master begs his captors not to let him be captured. Indeed, he confesses to having swindled Big Mom\u0027s research funds in the past. The pirates of this fearsome buccaneer begin their cannonball assault on the Sunny. However, Sanji manages to send one of the cannonballs back into the sea while Brook has taken the helm, steering the Sunny away from Dressrosa. Luffy\u0027s ship manages to dodge the attacks of her adversaries, who do not disarm and continue to fire cannonballs at her.\nWhile the crew of the Sunny try to save their lives, Franky, in the headquarters of King Riku\u0027s army, explains to Sanji that he can\u0027t bring an Emperor to the island, otherwise the plan of the Lightning Fury Soldier and the Dwarves will fail. At the same time, Luffy, looking for a way out of the Coliseum Corrida, learns that Caesar is still aboard the Sunny. Zoro, who is still being pursued by Navy soldiers, tells him that the negotiations between Law and Doflamingo have gone so badly wrong as to change all their plans. For her part, Nami supports Franky\u0027s proposal, explaining that she and her companions must not return to Dressrosa for three reasons: to prevent Doflamingo from recovering Caesar Clown and Momonosuke, to enable Franky, Robin and Usopp to destroy the Smiles Factory, and to ensure that Law\u0027s sacrifice was in vain.\nFaced with this new danger, the Straw Hat pirates realize that they must keep their new enemies at a safe distance from Dressrosa if they are to accomplish all their plans. Luffy orders Sanji, Nami, Brook and Chopper to flee and wait for them on the next island, Zou. However, Sanji asks his captain for permission to attack Big Mom\u0027s boat. Luffy agrees, while Franky takes charge of destroying Doflamingo\u0027s factory. The Straw Hat gives the go-ahead before ordering Zoro and Kinemon to leave for the Royal Palace to rescue Law and defeat Doflamingo.\nAt the same time, in the Coliseum Corrida, the Battle Royal of Block D continues to rage to the cheers of the audience.

Luffy\u0027s former enemy tries everything in his power to defend himself, but is no match for his opponent\u0027s agility. Bellamy tries to flee using his powers, but is quickly caught by Dellinger. Just as Dellinger was about to deliver the coup de gr\u00e2ce, Bellamy, who was lying badly wounded, was saved by Bartolomeo, who erected an impenetrable barrier between Dellinger and his prey. Suddenly, Doflamingo\u0027s subordinate receives a call on his snail phone from Diamante, instructing him to leave Bellamy and follow other orders from the King of Dressrosa: to guard the House of Toys with Lao G. But Dellinger is stubborn and desperately tries to break down the barrier created by Bartolomeo, who resists his kicks. Defeated, he gives up, obeying Diamante\u0027s orders, much to Bartolomeo\u0027s delight and Bellamy\u0027s relief, who realizes that he had been fooled by Doflamingo into ordering one of his minions to kill him. Bartolomeo tries to give him first aid, but Bellamy refuses his help, preferring to die. The winner of the Battle Royale of Block B disagrees, assuring Bellamy that he will never abandon a war brother in need.\nAt the same time, in the Flower Field, the Lightning Fury Soldier explains to Usopp, Robin and Franky the layout of the underground factory and the Trading Port in order to free the toy slaves and dwarves being held prisoner. The Toy Soldier also reveals the identity of the Demon Fruit user responsible for turning human beings into toys, and the frightening nature of his powers. It\u0027s Sugar, one of the main members of Don Quixote Doflamingo\u0027s crew, and his defeat will cancel its spell for good. Franky and Usopp are enthusiastic about this plan and decide to join in this major operation, much to the delight of the Tontattas tribe.\nMeanwhile, inside the Coliseum Corrida, Luffy is desperately searching for a way out. He soon comes face to face with Bartolomeo and Bellamy. The Straw Hat is reluctant to give up Ace\u0027s Demon Fruit, but he has no choice as his friend, Trafalgar Law, is in grave danger. Fortunately, Bartolomeo promises that he will win the Mera Mera no Mi and personally give it to Luffy, which is what he had planned to do all along. However, a man appears and claims that no one has the right to possess this Demon Fruit but him. Bartolomeo is outraged at the way the stranger has dared to speak to his idol. The latter suddenly starts crying when the mysterious stranger takes off his strange top hat and speaks to him as if they\u0027ve known each other all their lives...\nHaving found his way out, Luffy meets up with Zoro and Kinemon in the square in front of the Colosseum. Forced to disguise themselves as toy-like animals to avoid being spotted by the Navy soldiers searching for the three fugitives, Zoro asks Luffy why he can\u0027t stop crying. Luffy tells him that everything is fine and that Mera Mera no Mi is in good hands.\nElsewhere, in the middle of an alleyway, Koala, a member of the Revolutionary Army, is in escargophonic communication with the man who had met Luffy. The latter has taken his place in the tournament, carefully donning his battle gear to pass himself off as Luffy. He informs his accomplice that he has found the Straw Hat, while crying his eyes out. He also promises that he\u0027ll win Ace\u0027s Demon Fruit because he\u0027s inherited his will.

He confessed to them that he had found his brother, without saying his real name. With tears of joy in his eyes, Luffy recalls his childhood on Dawn Island with Ace and Sabo, and the sake ceremony that made them brothers.\nAt the same time, at Riku Army HQ, Franky\u0027s group and the Dwarves of the Kingdom of Tontatta are on their way to the Smile Factory. The Lightning Fury soldier explains that they\u0027ll have to use the underground tunnel the Dwarves have dug to get directly to the Trading Port. Kabu reminds them that the target to be eliminated is Sugar, special agent of the Don Quixote Family and holder of the Hobi Hobi no Mi, and that once she is defeated, the living toys will become human again! Unfortunately, the underground tunnel was too small for Franky. The Toy Soldier advises him to reach them via the House of Toys at the base of the plateau on which the Royal Palace stands. This is where all the kingdom\u0027s toys return every night. The cyborg has no choice but to pass through one of the four entrances to the House of Toys, all of which are heavily guarded. That way, he can save time and let the others take care of Sugar.\nFranky dashes through the city streets and soon arrives at one of the four entrances to the House of Toys to find himself face to face with Se\u00f1or Pink, a baby-like member of Don Quixote Doflamingo\u0027s crew, who is guarding the entrance, surrounded by young women and his subordinates. The latter immediately identify Franky as an important member of the Straw Hat Crew, who rush to attack the entrance with a \u0022Coup de Vent\u0022 that violently smashes the eastern fa\u00e7ade of the House of Toys.\nAt the same time, in the Royal Palace, Doflamingo is deep in conversation with Admiral Fujitora when he overhears the commotion coming from the House of Toys, along with Diamante, Pica and Tr\u00e9bol. The latter reassures Sugar that the Straw Hats are after the Smile Factory, not the Toy House. By the way, everyone in Dressrosa, with the exception of the ruling class, is unaware of Sugar\u0027s existence. And should they manage to get in, Doflamingo\u0027s prot\u00e9g\u00e9e can easily turn them into toys with her power.\nMeanwhile, in the underground passageway, Operation SOP is well underway. The flying squadrons of the Tontatta tribe take this route to the Trading Port, along with the Toy Soldier, the Dwarves, Robin and Usopp. The Lightning-Fury Soldier takes this opportunity to ask if Franky will be all right, but Usopp replies that there\u0027s nothing to worry about, and that he\u0027ll be able to defeat his opponents easily. But the one-legged soldier informs him that the four entrances to the House of Toys are protected by four high-ranking officers of the Don Quixote Family, members of the Army of Diamante. They are also big stars of the Coliseum Corrida, and each of them has a 100% chance of winning a tournament.\nBack in front of the House of Toys. Franky valiantly fights off Se\u00f1or Pink\u0027s subordinates, who shoot at him as their leader sneaks up from behind, \u0022swimming\u0022 towards the cyborg. Not wanting to use the element of surprise, he stands up to Franky with the intention of introducing himself, but receives a violent punch that sends him flying into the entrance of the House of Toys. To everyone\u0027s surprise, Se\u00f1or Pink gets up and returns to Franky before using his mysterious power once again, making him disappear into the ground as if by magic.\nNearby, the Dwarves continue their progress through the underground passage. Leo explains to Usopp and Robin the various members of the Donquixote Family, as well as the identities and strengths of the agents who carry out the operations. Doflamingo is the leader of this dangerous organization, followed by the \u0022Top 3\u0022 composed of Trebol, Diamante and Pica, each of whom leads a special army. First there\u0027s the \u0022Ace of Clubs\u0022 army, specializing in the use of special Demon Fruit powers and made up of Trebol, Sugar, Violet and Jora. Next comes the army of the \u0022Ace of Diamonds\u0022, specializing in close combat and comprising Diamante, Lao G, Machvise, Se\u00f1or Pink and Dellinger. Finally comes the \u0022Ace of Spades\u0022 army, specialized in special operations and made up of Pica, Gladius, Buffalo and Baby 5. These last two characters are old acquaintances of the Straw Hats, as Usopp remembers taking them down with Nami\u0027s help when he was at Punk Hazard. There are also two outside members, Vergo and Mone, who died when the Straw Hat Crew tried to capture Caesar Clown.\nMeanwhile, in the Coliseum Corrida, the Battle Royale of Block D continues to rage. Rebecca fights like hell to stay alive, taking on all her opponents with the help of Acilia, who has become her great ally. However, together they must fight Suleyman the \u0022Neckbreaker\u0022, who proves to be a tough fighter and hard to beat.\nAt the same time, the Dwarves and their allies soon reach the end of the tunnel and discover that they are in fact underneath the Colosseum. Usopp and Robin catch sight of a huge underground port, which surprises the Straw Hat Crew sniper with its sheer size...",

        "description": "At the Colis\u00e9e Corrida, the D Block Battle Royale is about to come to an end. Only thirty or so fighters remain in the ring, including Rebecca. Rebecca is about to face the terrible Suleyman, the Neckbreaker. He attacks her without warning, and a terrible battle begins between the two warriors. All around them, many fighters are engaged in battle, including Acilia and Orlumbus, who has just defeated a ferocious lion with a single stroke of his whip.\nSuddenly, Rebecca loses her sword and finds herself at the mercy of her opponent, who is ready to cut her to pieces to satisfy the Coliseum Corrida audience, who are dying to see the granddaughter of former King Riku perish. But Acilia intervenes and saves her young friend\u0027s life in extremis. She is seriously injured, however, and Rebecca understands the devotion of her colleague, who was her only ally in the tournament. Fiercely defending Rebecca, Acilia battles Suleyman, who defeats her without a fight. Mortally wounded, Acilia collapses in the ring. Rebecca runs to her side, crying. The valiant fighter begs her to hold on no matter what until the final, before breathing her last. Crying her eyes out, Rebecca vows victory, then picks up her sword and once again faces Suleyman in a fierce battle.\nMeanwhile, Luffy and his friends, still disguised as animals, head for the Royal Palace to rescue Trafalgar Law. Suddenly, Kinemon points out that Zoro has disappeared. Thinking that their companion has once again fallen victim to his poor sense of direction, the young pirate and the samurai don\u0027t look for him and decide to continue on their way to rescue Law from Doflamingo\u0027s clutches. For his part, Zoro realizes he\u0027s lost again. Suddenly, he is attacked by three rascals who mistake him for a \u0022moray cat\u0022. One of them tries to touch one of his swords. Zoro slaps him in front of his friends. The little boy starts crying, causing a huge commotion among the inhabitants of Dressrosa, who are horrified to discover that a toy has dared to raise his hand to a human! Feeling the heat, Zoro flees without a second thought. But he is soon pursued through the city streets by two armed guards who are desperate to stop this \u0022dangerous toy\u0022.\nAfter losing his pursuers, Zoro manages to find Luffy and Kinemon running towards the Royal Palace. They notice that their friend is accompanied by a young Dwarf, Wicca, who guides them to the palace entrance. She informs them that Operation SOP has already begun. Indeed, under Dressrosa, in the Commercial Port where numerous ships from all over the world are moored, numerous toys are busy carrying heavy loads.\nConcealed behind containers, Usopp learns from Leo, the Dwarves\u0027 leader, that the Lightning Fury Soldier has left to assassinate Doflamingo, leaving the Straw Hat Crew sniper at the head of the Royal Forces of the Riku Army to put Sugar out of action. Faced with this titanic task, the Dwarves reveal to Ussop and Robin the plan of Dressrosa\u0027s basement, before Leo shows them the Executive Tower where their target is located. Suddenly, they are spotted by two guards making their rounds. The guards are quickly incapacitated by the Dwarves, who strip them of their clothes before being knocked unconscious by Leo and Inhel before the astonished eyes of the two pirates. The two Dwarves give them the clothes of the two guards, so that Usopp and Robin can pass unnoticed through these secret installations. Intoxicated by the glory, Ussop takes command and invites the Dwarves to head for the Executive Tower to neutralize Sugar.\nNot far away, a large number of soldiers in Doflamingo\u0027s pay have come to the elevator after being informed of a fight between Franky and Se\u00f1or Pink at the east entrance to the House of Toys. Hiding inside a crate with some Dwarves from the Tontatta tribe, Soldier Lightning Fury hears this news. Seeing there\u0027s no other choice, the Toy Soldier assaults the guards in the elevator to take control of it. As he fights against them, the Lightning-Fury Soldier remembers the long training sessions given to Rebecca to make the best use of all the power of her human instincts to avoid being hurt and to fight very quickly. In doing so, he confirms his goal of returning Dressrosa to the Riku family, who are its rightful rulers.\nAt the same time, at the Coliseum Corrida, a strange attack occurs, with the result that each fighter in the arena is knocked out one after the other, like dominoes. The spectators in the stands, like Gats, Bartolomeo and Lucy, don\u0027t understand what has just happened. But suddenly, a mysterious figure staggers to his feet...",

        "description": "As the dust settles, the spectators at the Coliseum Corrida are surprised to find that the last fighter left standing is Rebecca, who automatically wins the D Block Battle Royal to the dismay of Gats and the entire crowd. Soon rumors of cheating spread throughout the Coliseum, but Rebecca is the only person who knows what really happened in the ring.\nAt the same time, outside the building, Vice-Admiral Bastille explains to a Navy soldier that he has come to Dressrosa to search for a certain pirate by the name of Hakuba, who turns out to be Cavendish\u0027s double personality when Cavendish is asleep. He then recalls events in the Kingdom of Rommel, where an elusive man had managed to elude the Navy years ago thanks to his dangerous technique.\nStill booed by the crowd at the Colis\u00e9e Corrida, Rebecca watches Cavendish lying unconscious in the ring. Suddenly, she remembers what happened during the fight when she was confronting the terrible Suleyman, who was after her life. The young gladiatrix had noticed that Cavendish had fallen asleep in the middle of the battle. The other warriors noticed this too, and took advantage of the situation to attack her. But Cavendish, by falling asleep, had brought out his dark side, Hakuba, who defeated everyone in the ring except Rebecca, who managed to dodge his attack in-extremis using her Observation Haki.\nBartolomeo and Lucy witnessed Rebecca\u0027s victory from the rostrum, as did Jesus Burgess, who couldn\u0027t wait to face such a gladiator. Watching her opponents still unconscious, the young woman picks up her helmet and heads for the grandstand, satisfied to finally be in the final to win the Mera Mera no Mi.\nMeanwhile, in front of the east entrance to the House of Toys, Franky is forced to face Se\u00f1or Pink, who warms up before the fight before the cyborg\u0027s incredulous eyes. But the Doflamingo Family member uses his power to thwart the attack of the Straw Hat Crew\u0027s carpenter, who discovers, astonished, that his enemy is extremely tough.\nAt the same time, in the Royal Palace, Doflamingo stands before the chained former King Riku. He discusses Rebecca\u0027s participation in the tournament and Violette\u0027s betrayal. The former ruler of Dressrosa thought that the false news of Doflamingo\u0027s abdication, which CP-0 had denied to the people of Dressrosa that very morning, might have brought some hope, but he was soon disillusioned. Especially as Trafalgar Law was also in the same room as him, chained, unconscious and entirely at the mercy of his worst enemy. The latter boasts that Luffy, allied with Law, could one day beat him. Doflamingo, on the other hand, knows that Franky is at loggerheads with Se\u00f1or Pink, a prominent member of his crew, and undermines the ability of Zoro, Kinemon, Robin and Usopp to reach the underground level of Dressrosa where the Trading Port is located.\nNearby, Robin and Usopp use their disguises to enter the underground port, helping the Dwarves to advance towards the Executive Tower, while at the foot of the King\u0027s Plateau, Luffy, Zoro, Kinemon, still in disguise and aided by Wicca, arrive at the elevator leading to the Royal Palace. Using this exit, they can also reach the House of Toys and the Trading Port, before making their way to the Smiles Factory to destroy it. Just as they\u0027re about to use it, Viola joins them and announces that she\u0027s going to help them...",

But Gats reassures the Coliseum crowd that Diamante, the national hero, will take part in the tournament in place of his prestigious colleagues.\nAs the crowd cheers their new champion, Rebecca wanders into the corridors of the huge amphitheatre and sees many of the wounded from Block D around her, including Cavendish and Acilia. The young gladiator thanks Acilia for helping her win this terrible battle. Suddenly, she finds herself face to face with Lucy, accompanied by Bartolomeo, winner of Block B. She tells him that she is also in the final, but notices that \u0022Lucy\u0022 is not the same person she had known before.\nAt the same time, on the King\u0027s Plateau, Viola advises Luffy, Zoro and Kinemon against using the elevator linking the Royal Palace to the Port of Commerce, after telling them that she is a former subordinate of Doflamingo, as well as the Princess of Dressrosa.\nNot far away, the battle for the House of Toys continues to rage. Franky is still fighting Se\u00f1or Pink, but now he has to face Machvise. Suddenly, Marine soldiers appear and surround the House of Toys, intent on arresting Franky. As Vice-Admiral Bastille\u0027s troops fire on him, the cyborg is forced to fight the Navy against his will.\nAt the same time, in the Royal Palace, Fujitora reveals to Doflamingo that he is in favor of the total abolition of the \u0022Royal Grand Corsair\u0022 system, because, in his opinion, a pirate of Doflamingo\u0027s ilk should not rule a country like Dressrosa. The Shichibukai takes this admission as a threat and violently attacks the Navy Admiral. However, Fujitora admits to Doflamingo that he won\u0027t intervene until the Straw Hat Crew has attacked the people of Dressrosa. He also adds that he\u0027ll deal with Doflamingo when the whole thing is over.\nAfter Viola reveals who she really is, she leads Luffy, Zoro and Kinemon to a secret passage leading to the Royal Palace. She claims that Doflamingo himself is unaware of her existence. Although the stairs are still available, the Straw Hat group prefers to take a basket elevator to save time, with Luffy acting as a counterweight using his Gomu Gomu no Mi powers.\nNot far away, in the Colis\u00e9e Corrida, Gats announces to the entire crowd that the grand finale of the tournament to win the Mera Mera no Mi is about to begin.

But Diamante is there to restore order and neutralizes the three hapless warriors by revealing the powers of her Demon Fruit. This respected member of the Donquixote Family announces to the competitors that a new element has been added to spice up this final, the prize of which is always Mera Mera no Mi, the Demon Fruit that once belonged to Ace aux Poings Ardents, a new kind of Fighting Fish with a face strangely resembling that of a buffalo. All the competitors notice that the box containing the coveted prize has been strapped to the back of one of these strange animals. Diamante harangues the crowd, announcing that if one of his opponents grabs the box and is the last man standing in the ring, he will be declared the winner of the tournament. Knowing what they had to do, the battle for the Mera Mera no Mi begins for Lucy, Bartolomeo, Jesus Burgess and Rebecca.\nIn the modified ring of the Coliseum Corrida, Jesus Burgess begins the hostilities with a surprise attack on Lucy. The latter dodges him easily and starts running along the pool to attract the Fighting Fish. One of them emerges and tries to grab Lucy, who escapes at lightning speed after realizing that the animal that had just swooped down on him didn\u0027t have the precious box on its back. Lucy tried with a second one, which didn\u0027t have the Mera Mera no Mi either. This exasperated Jesus Burgess, who imitated his opponent by luring two Fighting Pisces onto him in a bid for the prestigious trophy.\nMeanwhile, at the Royal Palace of Dressrosa, Luffy and his friends, still in disguise, carefully sneak past the Ramparts Tower to avoid being caught by the guards guarding the entrance, after using the secret passage revealed to them by Violette. But Luffy does not let his head drop, attacking the guards of the Tour des Remparts head-on as his companions look on in bewilderment. The Straw Hat and his friends must abandon their disguises and face Doflamingo\u0027s men. Doflamingo learns of the Straw Hats\u0027 infiltration of his palace by one of his men, while he watches \u0022Lucy\u0022 fighting in the Coliseum Corrida through a skyscraper. He realizes that something is wrong, because he knows that \u0022Lucy\u0022 is really Luffy! This situation sends him into a frenzy, and he demands to know what\u0027s going on and who this mysterious fighter is, fighting in the Coliseum Corrida instead of his enemy. For his part, the latter, accompanied by Zoro, Violette and Kinemon, continues to advance inside the Palace to rescue Trafalgar Law...",

        "description": "As they make their way inside the Royal Palace to flush out Doflamingo, Luffy wreaks havoc on his opponents, knocking them down one by one with his fists. His companions, Zoro, Viola and Kinemon, follow close behind, overpowering the Royal Palace guards with their own talents. In their haste, Wicca almost loses her life, but is quickly saved by Kinemon. Zoro asks him to stay with her, but the proud samurai refuses, arguing that he must go immediately to the House of Toys to free his friend Kanjuro, who is being held prisoner. Wicca also wants to accompany him there, as she wants to take part in Operation SOP, which had already begun. Knowing what they had to do, Wicca and Kinemon leave their friends behind and take the stairs down to the House of Toys in the basement.\nOutside the Royal Palace, guards gather to apprehend the intruders. After separating from Kinemon, they continue their search for Doflamingo\u0027s hiding place when the torches are suddenly extinguished one by one. They then have the unpleasant surprise of seeing a palace wall suddenly transform into a huge stone monster that rises up in front of them. Viola tells Luffy and Zoro that they must face Pica, a prominent member of the Doflamingo Family, who had eaten the Ishi Ishi no Mi, a Demon Fruit that allows its user to assimilate and control stone, in order to emerge or cover his body with it. Doflamingo\u0027s henchman uses this power as he attempts to eliminate the Straw Hats by flattening them. But Luffy doesn\u0027t give in and uses his own talents to take down this cumbersome adversary.\nHowever, Pica hasn\u0027t said his last as he gets back up and attacks the Straw Hat once again, and his friends realize that they\u0027re up against a tough enemy with the power to assimilate all the stones in the Royal Palace. This is not lost on him, who manages to apprehend the intruders by smashing two walls over them.\nMeanwhile, at the eastern entrance to the House of Toys, the battle continues to rage. Vice-Admiral Bastille\u0027s soldiers attempt to shoot Franky dead. But the cyborg\u0027s body is invulnerable to rifle bullets! Se\u00f1or Pink, annoyed at the Navy\u0027s meddling, tries to intervene, but is manhandled by one of the soldiers. Suddenly, Bastille intervenes and calms things down by making him understand that his superior, Issho, is in talks with Doflamingo as part of an agreement between the Navy and the Doflamingo family. For his part, Franky loses patience and attacks the Navy soldiers with rockets. Dismayed, the latter abandon their position, but Vice-Admiral Bastille orders them to use a new type of cannon whose projectiles fired at Franky immediately ignite the cyborg\u0027s entire body.\nSuffering a thousand deaths, Franky tries to escape the flames that are eating away at him, but to the delight of Bastille\u0027s men, in vain. But Franky\u0027s weakness was only a decoy, for to the amazement of the Marine soldiers, the cyborg rises again as if nothing had happened. He even continued to taunt his opponents, who fired at him out of spite.\nNot far away, in the Port of Commerce, the group led by Usopp manages to reach Sugar, who has turned Cavendish into a toy, and Trebol sends him off with his fellow toys, Xai, Hack and the great King Elizabello II, to work for the rest of their lives in the Port of Commerce. After this incident, the Dwarves, Usopp and Robin manage to sneak unseen inside the Control Tower. There, Leo reveals to Usopp the plan they\u0027ve concocted, namely to slip an extremely pungent grape, made from Tatababasco sauce, into Sugar\u0027s bowl. Sugar is so fond of grapes that she eats them constantly. Leo\u0027s plan is very simple: he needs Sugar to pass out after eating the tampered grape to break the curse that affects all Dressrosa\u0027s toys. Usopp agrees to the plan, and Leo begins Operation SOP, which could well shake the entire kingdom and show its inhabitants the true face of Doflamingo...",

        "description": "In the underground Trading Port, in front of the Executive Tower, Leo is about to put the fake grape he\u0027d managed to make from Tatababasco into Sugar\u0027s bowl, but he\u0027s stopped by Robin who, along with Usopp, has discovered the dangerous power of Trebol, who had eliminated a fly that had dared to bother him.\nMeanwhile, the ultimate battle for the Mera Mera no Mi continues to rage in the Coliseum Corrida. Gats is very enthusiastic, and in his commentary captures the audience\u0027s excitement at such a spectacle when he sees a new Fighting Fish emerge from the water to attack Jesus Burgess. The latter, far from being impressed by the animal, brings it down with a single punch using his powers, shaking the Colosseum to its foundations. His devastating power impresses the amphitheater crowd and Rebecca alike.\nSuddenly, another Fighting Fish emerges from the water, carrying on its back the box containing the Demon Fruit. All the tournament participants have spotted the animal and are preparing to fight it for the precious booty. But soon other Fighting Fish appear and join the first to attack all five fighters in the ring. Bartolomeo and Diamante easily take down several Fighting Fish, while Lucy is more interested in the one with the Mera Mera no Mi. The latter chooses to attack Rebecca, who defends herself as best she can but is no match for such an opponent. Lucy chooses this moment to jump on the animal\u0027s back to open the box on its back. Diamante is not pleased by her audacity and wants to get her hands on the Demon Fruit. A fierce battle ensues between the two competitors, but Lucy manages to break Diamante\u0027s sword blade using her staff.\nHowever, Lucy\u0027s prowess attracts the attention of Jesus Burgess, who is about to launch a lightning punch to bring down the Fighting Fish carrying the precious casket. Lucy stops him by using her haki and the dragon\u0027s claw technique, which shatters his attacker\u0027s armour to the delight of Gats and the audience. Bartolomeo is beside himself with joy at this prodigy, while Diamante wonders if the fighter he has in front of him is really Luffy. For her part, Rebecca realizes that she\u0027s not up to the level required to take part in the final of the Battle Royale. On the verge of giving up, she rethinks the words of her mentor and friend Acilia and finally pulls herself together by attacking Diamante from behind.\nAt the same time, in the elevator leading up to the Royal Palace, Soldier Lightning Fury finally overcomes the last guard to the cheers of the few Dwarves accompanying him. Suddenly, a terrifying adversary appears from nowhere. It\u0027s Lao G, a prominent member of the Donquichotte family, who takes down the Toy Soldier with a lightning-fast punch before his friends\u0027 very eyes. The latter try to help him, but are quickly overpowered by Lao G, who vows not to let these intruders reach the Palais Royal.\nNot far away, in the Tower of the Ramparts, Luffy, Zoro and Viola have a run-in with Pica, transformed into a huge stone statue thanks to his power, which crushes sections of wall on them. But the Straw Hat uses his gifts to save his friends in extremis. Zoro uses his Shuusui to fight his way to freedom, taking Viola with him. For his part, Luffy attacks Pica, who seems invulnerable to his punches. Zoro then takes over and tries to cut down his opponent with his sabers, but the latter lifts a section of wall to stop his assailant. Luffy goes back to punching Pica, who again uses the same technique to try and eliminate the intruders.\nThe din of battle reaches Kinemon, who is descending the stairs to the House of Toys. Pica\u0027s ceaseless transformations have considerably altered the architecture of the Palace, to the point of rendering the stairs unusable. This inconvenience comes at just the right time for Wicca, who advises the samurai to go all the way to the surface and take the main elevator, which will take them directly to the right destination. The only catch is that, by using this passage, the Palace\u0027s security will be reinforced. This is not a problem for Kinemon, who deflects it by using his powers to transform himself, before Wicca\u0027s horrified eyes, into a perfect Don Quixote Doflamingo look-alike!\nJust then, at the eastern entrance to the House of Toys, Franky\u0027s battle with the Marine forces continues unabated. Vice-Admiral Bastille decides to put an end to the battle by facing the cyborg alone. Even the officer\u0027s sword blows are no match for Franky, who rises to his feet as if nothing had happened, before the astonished eyes of the soldiers and Dellinger, who has come to see Se\u00f1or Pink. Dellinger asks his young comrade not to meddle in his affairs, while Luffy manages to break Pica\u0027s stone hand and one of his legs. The monstrous statue collapses heavily to the ground.\nLuffy and his friends flee, thinking they\u0027ve defeated the stone man once and for all, but he gets back up and regenerates his lost limbs. He then sets off in pursuit of the three intruders, who discover that it is very difficult for them to take down such an adversary. Once again trapping them by erecting a wall, Zoro manages to destroy it using his three sabers. He then asks Luffy to take Viola with him to continue their mission, while he takes care of Pica on his own, swearing to his friend that he will cut this man of stone to pieces...",

But Pica won\u0027t let the Straw Hat and his companion go, and does everything in his power to stop them. Zoro then goes to the rescue, cutting off the giant\u0027s fingers with his sabers, before continuing to cut him to pieces while Luffy makes his way back to Doflamingo. Just as he thought he\u0027d finally brought down his opponent, Pica emerges from a wall and tries to seize Zoro. But the swordsman is quicker and cuts him in two with a single sword! Pica proves to be a tough foe, however, for no sooner had Zoro knocked him down than he springs to his feet to attack again.\nAt the same time, in the elevator leading to Doflamingo\u0027s lair, the battle between Soldier Lightning Fury and Lao G continues to rage. The two fighters are of equal strength, and the battle is proving fierce. But the Toy Soldier is no match for the officer of the Donflamingo Family. He collapses before the eyes of his companions.\nNot far away, in the Smiles Factory, dwarf slaves have to grow artificial Demon Fruit in appalling conditions. An overseer punishes them for the slightest deviation, and forces them to produce more fruit, making them believe that they are needed to cure Princess Mansherry, who is extremely ill.\nFor their part, Robin and Bee Anne manage to create a diversion by luring Trebol out of the Tower of Control, while the Dwarves face Sugar alone. Before Usopp\u0027s astonished eyes, Leo manages to slip the tampered grape into their enemy\u0027s fruit basket without her noticing. Just as Sugar is about to eat the fruit, she throws it to the ground as if it wasn\u0027t to her liking. Seeing that Operation SOP is about to fail, the Dwarves come out of hiding to confront their adversary. The latter, far from impressed, uses her power to turn half of Leo\u0027s men into little black bears. Once she\u0027s done that, Sugar orders them to kill their comrades, who are astonished to discover that their enemy has little bodyguards, unaware that they are in fact their own friends transformed into toys! While the Baths are fighting each other, Sugar calls for Trebol\u0027s help over the loudspeaker, and Trebol realizes that her friend has been framed. Discovering Robin\u0027s imposture, he immobilizes the young woman in glue, but she escapes using her gifts.

At the same time, Luffy and Viola are still being pursued by Pica, who tries to catch them using his powers. But the Straw Hat doesn\u0027t give in and makes his way to Doflamingo\u0027s lair with his ally. For his part, Zoro continues to shear Pica\u0027s stone body, which regenerates in the blink of an eye as it draws its strength from the palace\u0027s stone blocks.\nNot far away, in the Colosseum Corrida, Rebecca fiercely attacks Diamante, who easily stops her move under the astonished gazes of Gats and the audience. Making a club appear as if by magic, he violently strikes the young warrior with such force as to shatter Rebecca\u0027s helmet! The unconscious Rebecca is now at the mercy of her opponent. Lucy, fighting against Jesus Burgess, asks Bartolomeo to protect the young woman. Meanwhile, Diamante, sure of his success, asks Rebecca how her mother, Scarlett, died when the Toy Soldier couldn\u0027t protect her.\nAt the same time, in the rubble of the Executive Tower, pulverized by the ship launched by Trebol, Robin arrives on the scene to rescue Usopp, who has been knocked unconscious by the building\u0027s collapse. The Straw Hat Crew sniper explains to his friend that he doesn\u0027t know what happened, before discovering that Leo\u0027s men and their leader have been captured by Trebol. The Dwarves, betrayed by their own naivety, reveal to Doflamingo\u0027s henchman that their accomplices are Usoland and the one-legged soldier. Informed, Trebol tells the Dwarves that the glue they\u0027re stuck in is flammable. Throwing away a lighted lighter, he leaves with Sugar, while all that remains of the Executive Tower goes up in smoke before the astonished eyes of Robin and Usopp. They come out of hiding to search for survivors. Usopp finds Leo in a bad way, who had managed to save the fake grape made from Tatababasco from the flames. His face covered in blood, he tells him that Operation SOP was not over. Leo confesses to Usopp that their commander is counting on him and his men if their plan to defeat Doflamingo is to succeed.\nOn the first floor of the Palais Royal, Soldier Lightning Fury suffered a severe beating from Lao G. Just as the latter was about to give him the coup de gr\u00e2ce, the toy soldier recalls his fight with Rebecca over the false rumors of Doflamingo\u0027s resignation from the throne of Dressrosa that very morning. Suddenly, the palace walls tremble and everyone realizes that Pica is up to no good. The surviving Dwarves take advantage of this incident to rescue their leader and take him away from Lao G, telling him that he is the only one who can defeat Doflamingo.\nAt the same time, Usopp can\u0027t understand why the Dwarves should have blind faith in this Toy Soldier. Leo then tells him that the Lightning-Fury Soldier was the first human to be transformed into a toy, but without signing a contract binding him forever to the Doflamingo Family, and that before he was bewitched by Sugar\u0027s powers, he was once the legendary gladiator Kyros...",

        "description": "Still battling with one of Doflamingo\u0027s right-hand men, Zoro duels Pica so that Luffy and Violette can escape and reach the upper floor of the Royal Palace, where Soldier Lightning Fury is already present. The latter fights fiercely against the palace guards, inflicting heavy losses on them with the help of Rambo and Kabu, the two Dwarves accompanying him. But Gladius, one of Doflamingo\u0027s subordinates, stands in his way. Rambo and Kabu step in to give their leader time to become human again and fight Doflamingo. But the fight is unequal for the two Dwarves, who are quickly captured by Gladius.\nThe Lightning Fury Soldier sees his two friends sacrifice themselves for him. He tries to flee from Gladius, who catches him and reveals his talents: he has eaten the Pamu Pamu no Mi, which enables him to shatter, from the inside, any part of his body and any non-organic matter, transforming him into a Lightning Man! Grabbing him by the throat, Gladius tries to use his powers to make the Toy Soldier\u0027s head explode, but Luffy arrives just in time to help him. With a lightning kick, the Straw Hat manages to knock his opponent to the ground and, in extremis, recovers the battered Lightning-Fury Soldier.\nStruggling to his feet, he spots Viola at the pirate\u0027s side. Seeing that the young woman has betrayed Doflamingo\u0027s trust, Gladius tries to eliminate them using his powers. Viola advises her friend to flee as quickly as possible. Mad with rage, Gladius implodes his head, severely injuring Viola after sending a shower of shrapnel at them. Luffy grabs her by the arm and continues running, carrying the Toy Soldier and the beautiful gypsy. Breaking through a window, the trio set off in the direction of the Palais Royal.\nThe three fugitives manage to outrun Gladius, who crosses paths with Kinemon, disguised as Doflamingo thanks to the power of his Demon Fruit. Not recognizing him, his lieutenant informs him that three intruders have entered the Royal Palace and asks him to take cover on the second floor while his men get rid of them. Instead, Doflamingo-Kinemon asks to see Kanjuro. Gladius informs him that the samurai has disappeared from the dump where he was locked up.\nMeanwhile, Luffy, Viola and Private Lightning Fury have arrived at the ceremonial room where Trafalgar Law is being held. The latter is being interrogated by Doflamingo himself, surrounded by Baby 5 and Buffalo, who had previously tortured the former Shichibukai. They also catch a glimpse of former King Riku, who is totally at the mercy of Dressrosa\u0027s new ruler. Luffy and the Toy Soldier are eager to act, but must wait for Leo\u0027s men to finish Operation SOP. Unfortunately, the Dwarves have failed in their attempt to make Sugar faint. Still protected by her bodyguard Trebol, he stops another Dwarf attack on his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, who orders the Dwarves, now transformed into little black bears, to confront their former comrades. Robin can\u0027t let them get away with it, and uses her powers to immobilize Trebol and Sugar, giving Leo time to force the Tatababasco grain down Sugar\u0027s throat. But the young archaeologist\u0027s tactics go awry, as Doflamingo\u0027s accomplice uses her gifts to turn Robin into a rag doll, leaving Usopp in deep distress. The only survivor of Operation SOP, he sees Trebol seize a huge boulder and hurl it at the Dwarf leader...",

        "description": "In the rubble of the Executive Tower, Trebol has defeated all Leo\u0027s Dwarves, while Robin has been turned into a rag doll by Sugar. Sugar notices the Tatababasco grain abandoned by Leo and picks it up for closer examination. Meanwhile, the archaeologist of the Straw Hat Crew, aware of her condition, desperately searches for Usopp, thinking for a moment that he has forgotten her so that he can help her become human again.\nNot far away, at the eastern entrance to the House of Toys, Franky continues to fire on sight at Dellinger who, thanks to his agility, easily dodges all his bullets and administers a lightning kick to the cyborg, who is knocked to the ground. Marine soldiers take advantage of the situation to machine-gun Franky, but his robotic body seems impervious to their assaults. This exasperates Dellinger, who wanted Franky all to himself. Vice-Admiral Bastille\u0027s soldiers suddenly stop firing and ask the cyborg to surrender, but he refuses. He stands up and launches into the attack, machine-gunning everything in his path, announcing his firm intention to demolish the House of Toys and praying that Usopp will do his duty to ensure the success of Operation SOP.\nMeanwhile, on the second floor of the Royal Palace, in the ceremonial chamber, Trafalgar Law and former King Riku are still Doflamingo\u0027s prisoners. Viola uses her gifts to tell Luffy and Private Lightning Fury that the Tontatta soldiers have been defeated by Trebol. This news doesn\u0027t help the Dwarf leader, while Luffy has absolute confidence in Usopp, the sole survivor of the operation to neutralize Sugar.\nAt the same time, Sugar is closely examining the Tatababasco grape that Leo intended to force down her throat. She suspects that the fake grape is poisoned. Leo, seriously wounded, begs Usoland to come and help him and his men, but the sniper takes fright and flees, leaving behind his friend Robin, still transformed into a toy, and the Dwarves who were counting on him.\nHaving settled the score with the Dwarves, Trebol orders his men to get back to work immediately. They obeyed, forcing the Toys to work harder in the Trading Port. For their part, the defeated Dwarves shout loudly for Usoland to come and help them. This astonishes Trebol, who asks Leo who Usoland is. The leader of the Tontatta soldiers replies that Usoland is their legendary hero, because he will be able to save them, free the toys working in the Trading Port and the Dwarf slaves in the Smiles Factory. Thanks to his bravery, he was able to thwart Sugar\u0027s curse and free half the inhabitants of Dressrosa, who had been turned into toys because of her. But Leo\u0027s words have no effect on Trebol, who tells them that the Dwarves have been fooled and that Usoland is a liar! For his part, Usopp hears the words of the Doflamingo Family officer and continues to flee. But Leo doesn\u0027t believe Trebol\u0027s lies and shouts at him to shut up immediately, telling him that Usoland has never lied.\nLeo\u0027s cries stop Usopp in his tracks for a moment, but the sniper, with tears in his eyes, continues to run instead of retracing his steps to save his friends. Tired of his whining, Trebol silences him by crushing the Dwarf leader with his foot in front of his comrades. This incident causes Usopp great sadness, and he can\u0027t stop running. Trebol takes advantage of the situation to trample more Tontattas, who continue to shout that Usoland is their hero and will come to save them.\nTired of hearing his friends\u0027 cries of pain, Usopp decides to return to the ruins of the Executive Tower to tell his friends the whole truth. He\u0027s not a legendary hero, he\u0027s just a pirate. This confession upsets Leo and his men, who had all believed in Usopp\u0027s sincerity. Meanwhile, Sugar and Trebol catch sight of the Straw Hat Crew\u0027s sniper. To redeem himself, he uses his kabuto to send a projectile at Trebol, who is cut in three before his comrade\u0027s very eyes. This act of bravery sparks a new surge of hope among the Tontattas, who realize that they once again have a savior in Usopp...",

        "description": "Using one of his most effective fighting techniques, Usopp manages to slice Trebol into slices before attacking Sugar, forcing him to swallow Tatababasco\u0027s grain under the admiring eyes of Leo and his men. But Trebol proves to be a very tough opponent for the Straw Hat Crew snipper, as the Doflamingo Family officer comes back to life using the powers of his Demon Fruit. Trebol uses them again in an attempt to eliminate Usopp, who runs for his life to avoid being killed.\nAt the same time, in the ceremonial chamber on the second floor of the Royal Palace, Trafalgar Law and former King Riku are still Doflamingo\u0027s prisoners. Doflamingo receives reports from his soldiers about a man who looks strangely like him and is pretending to be him. For his part, Private Lightning Fury, in the company of Luffy and Viola, sees the state of his former king and is eager to become human again if Operation SOP is successful. Viola informs her companions that her father had taken part in the tournament held in the Coliseum Corrida, but was defeated. At the mention of this heroic act, the toy soldier remembers his past when he was still human.\nWhen the Lightning Fury Soldier was still called Kyros, he was just a common street urchin who committed various misdeeds here and there. The soldiers of Riku\u0027s royal guard had a hard time stopping him, such was the 15-year-old\u0027s fighting ability. Suddenly, the King of Dressrosa appeared and tried to reason with Kyros, but he knocked him down with his nail-studded staff. On the verge of being slaughtered by the soldiers, King Riku orders them to spare the boy\u0027s life. Kyros explains that he had to fight to avenge the death of his best friend, who was murdered for no reason whatsoever. King Riku forgives him and asks him to follow him. Overnight, Kyros left the slums of Dressrosa to become a gladiator in the Coliseum Corrida. Despite his young age, he managed to defeat opponents far more powerful than himself. King Riku promises to free him if Kyros wins a hundred victories. Four months later, the young boy defeated his hundredth adversary and won his freedom. But the public\u0027s fear of seeing such a murderer on the streets of their town again forced Kyros to remain a gladiator for life!\nAs the years went by, Kyros trained to become even stronger. He soon won his two-hundredth victory, then his three-hundredth without anyone being able to beat him. Soon, after four years, Kyros wins his thousandth victory and becomes the crowd favorite at the Colis\u00e9e Corrida. But then, five years later, a mysterious masked warrior named Ricky comes to challenge him as Kyros fights his three-thousandth bout in a row. The latter defeats his new adversary with ease before the eyes of his audience. However, Kyros made an emotional gesture to the vanquished, for he had recognized him: it was King Riku! The latter offers to change his life and forget his nine years of captivity as a gladiator at the Colosseum Corrida. Moved, Kyros accepted the king\u0027s offer and, at the age of 25, became commander of the royal army of Dressrosa.\nHowever, Kyros\u0027s life was turned upside down when he met Scarlett, who had been suspicious of him at first, but changed her mind completely after he rescued her from pirates who had sacked Dressrosa. Madly in love with her savior, Scarlett faked his death so that she could spend the rest of her life with the man she loved. Kyros and his companion had a daughter, whom they named Rebecca. But these happy moments were soon overshadowed when Doflamingo took over Riku\u0027s kingdom...",

But when he arrives at the palace, he comes face to face with four members of Don Quixote\u0027s crew: Doflamingo, Buffalo, Machvise, Jora and Gladius. Alongside these pirates, he spots his young sister-in-law, Viola, escorted by Mone disguised as a servant. The latter asks Kyros to follow her to be presented before the new King of Dressrosa. Perplexed, the former Colosseum Corrida champion follows her without question and arrives in the palace audience hall. As he enters the room, he spots Sugar giving the signal to three of Doflamingo\u0027s henchmen to attack him, chaining Kyros\u0027 left leg. Kyros doesn\u0027t understand what\u0027s happening to him and tries in vain to break his chains using his sword, but it\u0027s no use as his shackles had been forged from Sea Granite.\nKyros suddenly hears the sinister laughter of Doflamingo seated in majesty with a sword in the company of Sugar, Machvise, Buffalo, Jora and Gladius. At the pirate\u0027s feet, the valiant captain of the guard sees King Riku handcuffed and at the mercy of his adversaries. Mad with rage, Kyros tries in vain to break his shackles, much to the delight of Doflamingo, who continues to sneer.\nDoflamingo offers Kyros his loyalty, or else the dethroned king and all the members of the former royal family will die, including Scarlet and Rebecca. But the valiant gladiator refuses to accept this infamous bargain and sacrifices his shackled leg by cutting it with his sword to strike Doflamingo. But Sugar doesn\u0027t give him the chance and transforms him into a common tin soldier with his power, before the astonished eyes of former king Riku.\nDespite being transformed into a toy, Kyros manages to escape from the Royal Palace, taking Riku with him to safety. However, following Sugar\u0027s curse, the former ruler of Dressrosa no longer remembers his former captain of the royal guard! Kyros then tries to protect Scarlett, but the young woman is killed by Diamante as she tries to collect food for Rebecca.\nBack to the present. Viola warns Luffy and Soldier Lightning Fury that Doflamingo\u0027s soldiers led by Gladius are coming to capture them. As their enemies climb the stairs to reach them, the toy soldier hopes that Usoland and the Dwarves have succeeded in their mission without knowing that Operation SOP is a fiasco.\nAt the same time, at the Coliseum Corrida, Jesus Burgess\u0027s attacks on Lucy are considerably weakening the building\u0027s foundations, while Diamante, the better to defeat Rebecca who is sheltered by a barrier created by Bartolomeo, reveals to her that he is the man who murdered her mother. This news upsets the young gladiatrix, who is in a state of shock. She feels responsible for having asked her mother to buy food for her, an act that cost her her life.\nFor his part, Franky is defeated by the combined assault of the Navy soldiers and the members of the Doflamingo Family. He suddenly thinks of Usopp to save Dressrosa. At the same time, in the underground Trading Port, Leo and his men cheer their champion, as do all the toys who silently encourage Usopp to defeat Doflamingo\u0027s henchmen in the ruins of the Executive Tower. Unfortunately, he\u0027s no match for Trebol, who receives a snail phone call from Doflamingo inviting him to take Sugar to the Royal Palace. As a final farewell, Sugar puts Tatababasco\u0027s grain into the defeated Usopp\u0027s mouth and forces it down his throat. But this awakens Usopp, who cries out in pain with a horrible expression on his face that frightens Leo and his men, who had given up hope, and terrifies Sugar to the point where she loses consciousness before the astonished eyes of Trebol, who begins to panic...",

Rebecca remembers that she once had a father, much to the astonishment of Bartolomeo, who would like to continue his fight against the young gladiatrix. For his part, Sabo, still disguised as Lucy, takes advantage of the situation and decides to put an end to it once and for all by blowing up the ring, while Koala, his accomplice, asks Hack to go to the basement of the huge circus.\nAs confusion reigns over the destroyed arena, Sabo jumps on the Fighting Fish holding the precious box containing the Demon Fruit and grabs the Mera Mera no Mi to eat it under Gats\u0027 nose before using his new powers to escape, taking Rebecca with him. Before the horrified eyes of Diamante and Jesus Burgess, who know his true identity, Sabo uses Ace\u0027s ancient abilities to punch a hole in the foundations of the Coliseum Corrida to gain easier access to the Trading Port below.\nAt the same time, in the ruins of the Executive Tower, Trebol is furious and wants to pay back to the Tontattas and the Straw Hat Crew for their daring attack on Sugar. With Robin\u0027s support, the Dwarves flee, taking with them Usopp, still unconscious, while the young archaeologist takes care of Trebol personally.

        "description": "While holding Rebecca by one arm, Sabo uses his other arm to completely destroy the Coliseum Corrida ring in order to dig an access to the underground port beneath the building. The young gladiatrix is unaware of the exact identity of the tournament\u0027s winner when Koala arrives with Sabo\u0027s clothes and announces that she has managed to make contact with Hack, who is already in the building.\nAt the same time, in the Port of Commerce, the former gladiators freed from Sugar\u0027s curse acclaim Usopp as a god, while the Dwarves celebrate him as their hero. Usopp, still uplifted by Hajrudin, asks them to destroy the Smiles Factory and restore freedom to the slaves still imprisoned there.\nOn the surface, Rebecca, Sabo and Koala leave the Colis\u00e9e Corrida to head for Hack\u0027s rendezvous, while the former tournament participants and the Tontattas accept their \u0022god\u0027s\u0022 decision to destroy the Smiles Factory. They all set off, despite Trebol\u0027s powerlessness to stop them. But Trebol doesn\u0027t give up and, with Robin watching on, takes Sugar with him, still unconscious, to block the insurgents\u0027 path.\nJust as Usopp was about to ask Hajrudin to put him down, Robin spotted Koala and Sabo, who were still taking Rebecca with them, heading for the factory. For his part, Jesus Burgess, who has landed with the other competitors in the underground port, digs himself out of the rubble of the ring while raging in anger. He is soon joined by Diamante, who doesn\u0027t know how to tell her boss Doflamingo about the whole mess when she sees the former participants of the Colis\u00e9e Corrida storming the Smiles Factory. The Doflamingo Family officer, soon backed up by Trebol, decides to stop them.\nKoala and Sabo manage to find Hack, who is delighted to be reunited with his companions. Rebecca, who had accompanied them, is impressed by the place she is in, which she also didn\u0027t know existed. As Koala hands Sabo his clothes, he reveals to the young gladiatrix and Bartolomeo, who has joined them, that he is the second in command of the Revolutionary Army, along with his friends Koala and Hack, and that the \u0022first\u0022 Lucy was in fact a pirate named Luffy. Sabo then recalls his childhood days on Dawn Island with Luffy and Ace, and their shared dream of one day becoming pirates.\nAfter an emotional recollection of his past, Sabo confesses to Rebecca and Bartolomeo that the Revolutionary Army has come to Dressrosa to put an end to the arms trafficking taking place there, which is permanently aggravating wars around the world. For his part, Koala informs them that the Revolutionary Army has sent soldiers to Dressrosa in the past, but that they have been turned into toys by Sugar. However, Sabo and his companions, unaware that they are being spied on by two Doflamingo guards, realize that the weapons they want to dismantle are not manufactured here but elsewhere on Dressrosa. They set out to find and destroy this manufacturing site.\nAt the same time, in the capital of Dressrosa, chaos breaks out in the city streets as pirates seek revenge on Doflamingo for turning them into toys. The city\u0027s inhabitants are also fleeing terrifyingly ferocious beasts. At the entrance to the House of Toys, Se\u00f1or Pink, Machvise and Dellinger are unable to cope with the situation, as are the Navy soldiers led by Admiral Issho. Not far away, Franky, in a bad way, gets up despite his wounds. He neutralizes a guard to escape, while on the King\u0027s Plateau in front of the Tour des Remparts, Zoro, who had lost sight of Pica, contemplates the city, realizing that something serious has happened.\nOn the first floor, Kinemon, disguised as Doflamingo, asks some angry pirates to let him pass. But the pirates, believing they were dealing with the man responsible for all their misfortunes, fired at him. However, the samurai, still accompanied by Wicca, manages to evade them by climbing to the ceiling of the elevator to avoid being hit by their bullets. Kinemon doesn\u0027t understand what\u0027s happened to him. Wicca, on the other hand, guesses that Operation SOP has been a success and advises her friend to return to his normal appearance immediately, otherwise he won\u0027t be the target of Doflamingo\u0027s former victims. Kinemon obeys this advice and sets off in search of Kanjuro.\nIn the Trading Port, Robin is happy to find Koala, Sabo and Hack, whom she had met during her captivity at Tequila Wolf, and takes the opportunity to introduce them to Usopp. At the same time, at the Royal Palace, Kyros, still driven by his thirst for revenge, has defeated all Doflamingo\u0027s soldiers before attacking Buffalo, who suffers the same fate before Baby 5\u0027s eyes, while Luffy and Viola bring the key that opens Trafalgar Law\u0027s Sea Granite handcuffs. Just as Kyros is about to free the former King Riku, Gladius appears in the room and loses his temper at the sight of his master\u0027s decapitated body. Luffy takes advantage of this moment to try and unlock Law\u0027s handcuffs, who gravely announces that the Pirate Alliance is over and that they are enemies once again. But suddenly, a sinister laugh is heard. Soon, the Straw Hat and his friends see Pica emerge from the stone, while Doflamingo, whom everyone thought dead, begins to speak despite being decapitated. The Shichibukai, who knows what is causing the unrest in Dressrosa, tells them he intends to use the Birdcage to solve the problem, a plan that does not bode well for Trafalgar Law....",

But their attempt is halted by the two elite officers of the Doflamingo Family, who use their respective powers to stop the rebellion.\nElsewhere, in Dressrosa, chaos has reached the streets of the capital, while at the Royal Palace, Doflamingo, even decapitated, is enjoying his revenge. This is too much for Kyros, who is about to strike again at the King of Dressrosa when a second Doflamingo appears and prepares to decapitate the former Coliseum Corrida champion. However, the latter is narrowly saved by Luffy, who then fights with the great corsair for several long minutes. The fight quickly turns to Luffy\u0027s advantage, as he strikes the first blow with a treacherous blow from behind. Viola discovers to her horror that the \u0022Doflamingo\u0022 that Kyros had managed to decapitate was in fact a puppet son. Doflamingo takes advantage of this moment to force former King Riku to remember the tragic events of ten years ago in Dressrosa, while predicting a similar destiny that will soon unfold. Then, annoyed, Doflamingo asks Pica to eject the intruders from the palace while he uses the \u0022Birdcage\u0022 technique, using his clone\u0027s decapitated body to prevent anyone from leaving the island without his permission.\nWitnessing the scene, Trafalgar Law, who has been in this situation before, explains to his companions that one of Doflamingo\u0027s darkest designs is to kill all the inhabitants of Dressrosa to prevent the truth about the country from being revealed to the world. Trapped by this impenetrable barrier, the people of Dressrosa can do nothing, and neither can the Navy soldiers, who can\u0027t call for reinforcements at headquarters because their means of communication are jammed by this strange, demonic \u0022Birdcage\u0022. Suddenly, soldiers and pirates are struck by lightning and start slaughtering each other for no reason at all. Only Issho, who has managed not to get hit, understands what\u0027s going on. Tiny wires strike every inhabitant of the island, inciting them to kill each other to the delight of Doflamingo, who manipulates all his victims like common puppets.\nSuddenly, the island begins to shake and all the inhabitants watch in horror as the King\u0027s Plateau sinks before them. Luffy and his friends on the scene discover that this is the work of Pica. Using his power, Pica raises the palace into the air, causing panic throughout the island. Pica does the same to the Smiles Factory, which flies off along with The Field of Flowers, sucking in the rest of the city, with no one able to do anything about it.\nKnowing that he had now won on all counts, the real Doflamingo addresses all Dressrosa\u0027s citizens by giant skydiving machine, offering them to take part in a game where the first to die loses...",

        "description": "The citizens of Dressrosa and the soldiers of the Navy are doing everything they can to leave the island. But their efforts are doomed to failure, as Doflamingo\u0027s \u0022Birdcage\u0022 in which they are trapped is indestructible. Some people, manipulated by the master of the place, continue to kill indiscriminately without being able to do anything about it. Some try to contact the outside world, but communications are cut off by Doflamingo\u0027s diabolical trap, plunging Dressrosa further into chaos.\nAt the same time, in the underground Trading Port, the disappearance of the Smiles Factory allows the former gladiators of the Colis\u00e9e Corrida to come out into the open while blessing the name of their savior Usopp. For his part, Kinemon finds Robin chatting quietly with his friends Sabo, Koala and Hack. The samurai is suddenly disturbed by Rebecca\u0027s suggestive outfit, while Bartolomeo carefully examines Sniperking\u0027s wanted notice, comparing it with the still unconscious Usopp. He suddenly realizes that he\u0027s dealing with one of the most esteemed members of the Straw Hat Crew. Bartolomeo is excited to be in the company of such a celebrity. This exasperates Sabo, who asks his former tournament opponent to shut up, while Hack recalls that it was Bartolomeo who was the man who broke his arm. Far away from the tumult, Kinemon entrusts Leo\u0027s Tontattas warriors Rambo and Kabu, who have defended their commander to the best of their ability.\nOutside, the streets of Dressrosa\u0027s capital are in total chaos, with everyone remembering the tragic incidents that led former king Riku and his soldiers to massacre his people, and quickly realizing that they had been manipulated by Doflamingo. Doflamingo uses his powers to move his victims like puppets from the Royal Palace. King Riku implores him to stop this cruel game, and Doflamingo takes advantage of this moment to reveal to the entire population the list of bounties awarded to each member of the Straw Hats and their allies - a total of twelve people, classified by different categories, with a bounty of 100 million berries per head!\nFirst there\u0027s the one-star group, which includes Rebecca, the granddaughter of former King Riku, Robin, Kinemon, Viola and Franky. Next comes the two-star group, which includes Kyros, Rebecca\u0027s father, and Zoro. Then comes the three-star group featuring Sabo, second-in-command of the Revolutionary Army, Luffy, Trafalgar Law and Riku Doldo III, former ruler of Dressrosa. To make matters worse, Doflamingo reveals that Usopp is the one holding the biggest bounty, as he is responsible for all the misfortunes that have befallen the island!\nThe bounty of 500 million berries promised on Usopp\u0027s head attracts the greed of former gladiators who want to get their hands on him. Sabo advises his friends to escape to the surface, while Kinemon abandons them to rescue his friend Kanjuro, who is still a prisoner. Usopp, still in a bad way, is transported by the Tontattas, while his companions follow close behind. For his part, Kinemon sets off in search of his friend, but is spotted by a group of gladiators intent on taking his bounty. To escape, the samurai has no choice but to jump into a huge hole that connects with a dump below.\nAt the same time, Doflamingo\u0027s announcement electrifies the inhabitants of Dressrosa, who must submit to his wishes. However, some of them are reluctant to betray the former king Riku, who is one of the twelve wanted criminals, and feel it would be wiser to capture them rather than kill them.\nMeanwhile, at the east entrance to the House of Toys, Dellinger boasts that one of the wanted criminals is near him. He\u0027s thinking, of course, of Franky, who\u0027s knocked out. But the cyborg has disappeared under the noses of Machvise, Se\u00f1or Pink and Dellinger, who realize that all their soldiers guarding him have been knocked out. Franky, revitalized after a heavy dose of cola, sets out to destroy the Smiles Factory. Unfortunately, he is quickly spotted by a few locals who set off in pursuit of his bounty. Franky manages to stop them using his weapons, but other people, blinded by money, surround him to capture him. Caught in a trap, the cyborg must defend himself at the expense of the innocent victims who want to get their hands on him, before running off to fulfill his mission.\nAt the entrance to the factory, Diamante and Trebol, who are guarding the entrance, notice that the entire building has risen thanks to Pica\u0027s powers. They suddenly receive a snail-like call from Doflamingo, who orders them to return immediately to the Royal Palace. The two officers of the Doflamingo Family obey, while Robin and his friends make their way out of the Underground Port to the surface. Bartolomeo, still hot on the heels of their pursuers, takes charge of them, erecting an impenetrable barrier using his gifts. While still running, Robin receives a call from Zoro, who informs the young archaeologist that he and Luffy are on the King\u0027s Plateau. The Straw Hat suddenly takes the snail phone from his friend\u0027s hands to speak to Robin and ask if Rebecca is next to her. He tells her that the Lightning Fury Soldier is her father. Straw Hat comforts her as best he can, telling her to stay with her friends who will protect her no matter what, while solemnly promising to put an end to this cruel game and defeat Doflamingo once and for all...",

He is joined by Admiral Issho, who explains that no matter what Doflamingo has done, he has become untouchable and cannot be stopped.\nOn the King\u0027s Plateau, Viola, in the company of her father, takes charge of finding the key to Trafalgar Law\u0027s Sea Granite handcuffs, which had fallen off after Pica expelled them from the palace, while Luffy, without even asking his two companions\u0027 permission, takes Law and Zoro under his arms to jump into the void to find Doflamingo.\nIn the ruins of the Coliseum Corrida, the Marine soldiers on guard take fright when they see hundreds of people rising from the ground. Among them are soldiers, World Government officials and pirates rushing to escape from the underground port where they were imprisoned. While the freed Cavendish sets off in search of Luffy, Maynard reports to Bastille, who is astonished by his presence there. Bastille scolds him for taking part in the tournament and risking his own life. But Maynard admits to being aware of Doflamingo\u0027s misdeeds and advises his superior to take the pirate into custody.\nMeanwhile, in the underground Trading Port, where pirate ships are still moored, Koala boards one of them to search for weapons. She discovers weapons hidden in the ship\u0027s holds, which she inspects. She learns that the ship was originally from the Kingdom of Doerena, and that it had disguised itself as a pirate ship to better profit from the arms trade. Using a photographic snailophone to take pictures, the young woman is surprised by sailors who intend to set fire to their ship in order to erase all evidence. But Koala prevents this by taking them on one by one, using the Fishman Karate taught to her by Hack.\nOutside, Dressrosa is in total chaos. Fires are breaking out all over the capital, with the authorities unable to stop them. Maynard takes advantage of this moment to ask Issho why the Navy couldn\u0027t arrest Doflamingo, even knowing what he\u0027d done. Issho replies that the situation has become untenable since the World Government decided to rule everything its own way. This news took Maynard by surprise, leaving him speechless.\nAt the same time, Doflamingo\u0027s business seems to be moving forward. Doflamingo holds the only keys that can open the doors of the Smiles Factory, whose walls, made of Sea Granite, are indestructible. He destroys them in front of his entire crew. While watching Sugar, still unconscious, Lao G harshly judges Trebol for his incompetence. Trebol defends himself by confessing to his master that he couldn\u0027t understand how a man, tied hand and foot, had been able to stun Sugar. Diamante, for her part, provides the same kind of response, telling Doflamingo that he couldn\u0027t believe that the second-in-command of the Revolutionary Army could have taken part in the tournament and seized the Mera Mera no Mi. Their master forgives them, as it was all in the past, and prefers to concentrate on present events, telling his men that the Navy will not chase them, but that Fujitora will have to be eliminated anyway, as he intends to abolish the Shichibukai system altogether.\nIn the streets of Dressrosa\u0027s capital, Navy soldiers, having subdued a few of the madmen, set off in pursuit of the Straw Hats and Trafalgar Law to arrest them. They fail to notice the presence of Machvise, Se\u00f1or Pink and Dellinger, who remain unmolested by the police. As he sees the Marine troops running in all directions, Se\u00f1or Pink remembers Franky\u0027s last words and his intention to destroy the Smiles Factory. He wants to stop him at all costs, and decides with his acolytes to finish him off.\nFor his part, Franky has managed to lose the Navy agents and takes it upon himself to destroy the Smiles Factory as planned. Nearby, Luffy, Zoro and Law come across Machvise, Se\u00f1or Pink and Dellinger. Dellinger recognizes Law and tries to stop him. Luffy stops him but, as he tries to flee, Se\u00f1or Pink grabs him by the feet after rising from the ground with his power. Threatened with being crushed by Machvise\u0027s enormous weight, Luffy manages to extricate himself in extremis by stretching as far as he can. Unfortunately, he is threatened again by Dellinger, who is about to hit him. He is narrowly saved by Zoro, who deflects his adversary\u0027s attack and violently hits Machvise. The three fugitives are about to flee again when the citizens of Dressrosa, baited by the bounty promised on their heads, block their path. Luffy, Zoro and Law owe their lives to the unexpected appearance of Issho and his men, who intend to arrest the three pirates. The surprised pirates recognize him...",

        "description": "Luffy, Zoro and Trafalgar Law face Issho and his men. The Straw Hat asks Issho to let him pass, as he has a score to settle with Doflamingo, but the Navy Admiral refuses to obey him and blocks the way to the Royal Palace, where his enemy is. Luffy has no choice but to confront him using his Haki. But his attack is stopped by Issho\u0027s skill: even a blind man can fight a young pirate as impetuous as Luffy.\nAt the same time, at the Royal Palace, one of Doflamingo\u0027s soldiers warns him that Luffy and his companions are fighting against Fujitora and the Navy forces. This situation delights the master of Dressrosa, who doesn\u0027t want to intervene. However, Pica, with her delicate voice that takes Doflamingo\u0027s guards by surprise, disagrees with her boss and decides to take care of them personally to finish them off. But Doflamingo calms his ardor by explaining that the game he has set up will determine which family is the most worthy to rule Dressrosa: either the Riku Family or the Doflamingo Family. Pica, however, is determined to settle the matter himself, and his high-pitched voice makes one of the soldiers laugh, which immediately incurs the wrath of Doflamingo\u0027s lieutenant, who can\u0027t bear anyone making fun of his voice. But Baby 5 stops him by doing the dirty work herself. Metamorphosing her right leg into a machine gun, she kills the guard who had mocked Pica before the delighted eyes of Doflamingo and his acolytes. The other guards are frightened and terrified by the scene.\nAfter the body of the unfortunate guard is thrown out of the Royal Palace so that his family can bury his remains, Doflamingo reveals to his men that he lost his mother when he was 8 and murdered his father when he was 10. His men, who have received the rank of officers in his crew, form his family, and he warns anyone who comes into contact with him that he will not allow anyone to mock one of his family members with such impunity, at the risk of incurring his wrath.\nNot far away, in the ruins of the Coliseum Corrida, men-at-arms track down Usopp. Knowing he was worth five stars, they set out to kill him and pocket the reward promised on his head. Usopp, along with Robin, Rebecca, Hack, Bartolomeo and Leo\u0027s Dwarves, who are carrying him on their backs, try to outrun their pursuers. As she runs, Robin tells Rebecca of her plan: to access the King\u0027s Plateau via one of the Colosseum\u0027s outer walls to join the rest of her companions, who are already there.\nSeeing the number of their pursuers increasing, Hack stops running and decides to confront them, using Fishman Karate to give his friends more time to escape. His tactics work, but other men, baited by money, appear to pounce on Robin and Rebecca. The two young women owe their salvation to Bartolomeo who, thanks to a barrier of his own design, prevents them from being captured. Robin thanks her savior, who is deeply moved. Bartolomeo invites her to continue her race while he holds off their pursuers for as long as possible.\nAt the same time, Luffy stands up to Issho, who refuses to yield an inch to the young pirate. Using his powers, he pushes the Straw Hat back in front of Zoro, who can\u0027t accept this. Zoro immediately launches into the attack, confronting the Admiral with saber blows. But he\u0027s no match for Issho\u0027s fencing skills, and the Admiral counters all his parries. Machvise and Dellinger, witnesses to the scene, stand back from the fight in front of them before noticing the absence of Se\u00f1or Pink, who had set off in search of Franky. The latter arrives at the Smiles Factory with the aim of destroying it and freeing the Dwarf slaves still trapped inside.\nAt the same time, in the Coliseum Corrida, Robin and his group have reached the outer wall adjoining the Royal Palace. The Dwarves are distraught, as they won\u0027t be able to scale such a height on their own. The young archaeologist reassures them and, using her gifts, creates a giant mesh to scale the immense wall. Enthralled by this prodigy, Rebecca calls Hack and Bartolomeo to join them as soon as possible. The former competitor in the Colis\u00e9e Corrida tournament is delighted to have received the invitation, as he\u0027ll be able to see his idol Luffy again!\nMeanwhile, on the King\u0027s Plateau, Viola is in the company of former king Riku. She is actively searching for the key that will free Law from his Sea Granite handcuffs. She manages to find it using her abilities, but also to detect her niece, who is in a very bad way. Rebecca, who is at the foot of the rampart, is attacked by three armed men. She is saved in extremis by Tank, who immediately kneels before her and swears to serve her to the end. Riku, who has recognized his voice, calls out to him at the top of the wall. Tank is delighted to see the former ruler of Dressrosa again, as is Rebecca, who can\u0027t hide her joy at the sight of her beloved grandfather.\nA long way from this reunion, in the streets of the city, Kyros continues his race, still determined to bring the Riku Family back to power, while Kinemon finds himself at the bottom of a rubbish dump after his vertiginous fall. Around him, he notices men asking him if he\u0027s all right. The samurai thanks them for their concern before asking if they knew a man called Kanjuro. Suddenly, however, an immense rumbling is heard, shaking the whole island of Dressrosa and causing panic among the population. This incident puts an end to the duel between Zoro and Issho. The Swordsman of the Straw Hat Crew, the Navy soldiers, Trafalgar Law and Luffy witness the appearance of Pica, who has taken on the appearance of a giant stone Golem. He tells them that he intends to destroy all those who dare stand in the way of the Donquichote Family. Upon hearing these words, Luffy can\u0027t help but laugh at the giant\u0027s high-pitched voice, provoking his anger.\nExasperated by the Straw Hat\u0027s incessant laughter, Pica is about to unleash a tremendous punch, the mere sight of which sends his own companions, Machvise and Dellinger, and his soldiers fleeing, as they decide to make for the Royal Palace to avoid being killed. As he flees with Trafalgar Law, Luffy is stopped in his tracks by his friend\u0027s Sea Granite chain. They are about to be pulverized by Pica\u0027s punch, before the helpless eyes of Zoro, who can do nothing to stop the giant who is destroying everything in his path...",

All the inhabitants are frightened by the sight of the huge stone hand still embedded in the streets of their city. All fear a second outburst from the giant. For his part, Zoro is unharmed and manages to free himself from the rubble that was in his way with his sword. He immediately sets off in search of Luffy and Law. He soon finds them, suspended in mid-air, after realizing that the Straw Hat and his ally were unharmed by Pica\u0027s lightning attack. Law reprimands Luffy for daring to mock the giant\u0027s high-pitched voice. Such an act would be tantamount to dying at Pica\u0027s hands!\nWhile wondering where they are, Luffy and his friends come across Cavendish, who is determined to repay their debt to Usopp by beheading Doflamingo himself, which Luffy strongly objects to, as he wishes to deal with his enemy personally.\nNot far away, the soldiers of the current ruler of Dressrosa actively search for the lifeless body of the Straw Hat under Pica\u0027s undaunted gaze, but without the slightest success. They realize that he must have been ejected with the rest of his companions to another part of the city. However, the stone giant doesn\u0027t want to call off the search, as he hasn\u0027t forgotten the mockery Luffy inflicted on him in connection with his high-pitched voice.\nAt the same time, Luffy, carrying Law on his back, and Zoro are running together. They are stopped by men-at-arms who covet the bounty promised on their heads. Instead of fleeing, Luffy and Zoro attack them head-on and get rid of them easily. But more men appear, and the pirates, outnumbered, can\u0027t bring themselves to fight them all. Just as they are about to flee, a new group of men appears and Luffy recognizes Don Chinjao, Xai and Boo, with whom he had fought at the Coliseum Corrida tournament. But instead of attacking them, these three men want to offer their help to the Straw Hat and his friends.\nAfter confessing that he no longer holds a grudge against his family and that Usopp saved them, Don Chinjao and his grandsons are ready to help Luffy and his companions in their fight against Doflamingo. But the Straw Hat is not happy about this prospect, and still wants to take care of his enemy himself. Don Chinjao gets angry and is about to fight Luffy when Hajrudin, the powerful warrior from Elbaf, appears. After asking him to forget what happened at the Coliseum Corrida, Hajrudin also offers his help, along with King Elizabello II and his military advisor Dagama, to pay off his debt to King Riku. So do the bounty hunter duo Jeet and Abdullah, in memory of Usopp\u0027s help in freeing them from Sugar\u0027s yoke, and Orlombus, accompanied by Ideo, Suleyman and Blue Gilly. They all want Doflamingo\u0027s head, including Cavendish.\nLuffy tries to reason with them, but to no avail. However, the Straw Hat and his friends are soon found by men-at-arms who still want the rewards promised on their heads. They are prevented from doing so by the tournament\u0027s former participants. Luffy and Zoro take advantage of this moment to flee, but just as they are about to leave, the Straw Hat sees Ucy, the fighting bull who had helped him at the Colosseum, appear before him. The animal also recognized him. The young pirate has an idea that could work in his favor. Climbing onto Ucy\u0027s back with Zoro and Law still handcuffed, Luffy set off to attack Doflamingo\u0027s guards as they searched in vain for him in the rubble. The two members of the Straw Hat Crew are soon joined by former tournament participants, who lend a hand against Luffy\u0027s wishes. This situation once again fuels Pica\u0027s anger. He rises to his feet and prepares to strike again at the capital of Dressrosa, after announcing his intention to arrest them in a small voice. All the former champions of the Colis\u00e9e Corrida can\u0027t help but laugh at his high-pitched voice, which irritates Pica more and more. Pica is now ready to strike again. Don Chinjao and Elizabello II notice his gesture and together destroy his enormous destructive arm before the astonished eyes of Pica and his men. This heroic act cheers up all the men accompanying the Straw Hat, who still want to kill Doflamingo against Luffy\u0027s advice...",

However, the huge Golem is not so easily defeated. As he regenerates, he uses his remaining arm to rout the attackers who had noticed that Luffy was no longer with them on the battlefield. They see him, still riding Ucy, climbing up the immense Golem\u0027s other stone arm, but the latter eventually catches sight of him.\nAfter Pica has finished regenerating the stone arm shattered by Chinjao and Elizabello, he prepares to use it to smash the Straw Hat. But Luffy doesn\u0027t let up, smashing the giant\u0027s head with a Grizzly Magnum.\nMeanwhile, on a devastated street in the capital of Dressrosa, a naval soldier reports to Admiral Fujitora that former gladiators from the Coliseum Corrida are heading with Luffy for the Royal Palace, where Doflamingo is staying. This news does not surprise Issho, who immediately sends a snail-mail call to Vice-Admiral Bastille to inform him of the situation. Fujitora asks all his men scattered around the city by Pica to assemble at the foot of the Royal Palace to launch the counter-attack.\nFor his part, Kyros continues to advance through the city, ignoring the citizens of Dressrosa who want to award the promised bounty on his head. Suddenly, he sees innocent civilians being manipulated by the demonic power of Doflamingo. This vision brings back painful memories of the time when the head of the Doflamingo Family took over the island using the same ruse. Determined to restore Dressrosa\u0027s reputation, Kyros vows to overthrow Doflamingo in the name of King Riku.\nNot far away, on the King\u0027s Plateau, Robin and his friends continue to climb one of the outer walls of the Royal Palace next to the Coliseum Corrida. However, they are pursued by a group of armed men who want to seize the bounty promised for the capture of Rebecca, Robin and Usopp - a total of 700 million berries. But the archaeologist of the Straw Hat Crew doesn\u0027t want to let them get away with it, and forces his comrades to climb the wall faster, much to the delight of Bartolomeo, who lives this great moment alongside his idols. When everyone has managed to set foot on the Plateau, Robin magically makes the net they used to climb the immense wall disappear, and sees their pursuers fall into the void below her.\nAt the same time, the body of the gigantic decapitated Golem threatens to topple over the city, but it\u0027s strong enough for Luffy and his group, still on Ucy\u0027s back, to reach the Royal Palace safely. Suddenly, Zoro notices that Pica\u0027s body is empty! He has a hunch that their adversary is very close to them. His warrior\u0027s intuition is justified as Pica appears in person, without his stone armor, and threatens the insurgents with his great sword. However, Zoro steps in and, mocking his soprano voice, begins a duel to the death with Doflamingo\u0027s terrifying subordinate, while Luffy heads for the Royal Palace to settle Doflamingo\u0027s score once and for all...",

        "description": "The former gladiators of the Colis\u00e9e Corrida find that the colossal stone body of Pica that Luffy had managed to decapitate is no longer moving. They take advantage of the situation to continue on their way to the Royal Palace in the hope of defeating Doflamingo once and for all. On the way, they sweep aside their adversary\u0027s guards with a wave of their hands, as various members of the Doflamingo family look on in admiration. Lao G informs his comrades that Navy soldiers, led by Admiral Fujitora, are gathering at the foot of the Royal Palace. The blind admiral is on the front line and knows that half his men are already there.\nFor his part, Baby 5 tells his colleagues that four groups have formed. First of all, the former participants in the Colis\u00e9e Corrida, who are on their way to the palace; then Kyros, the legendary champion of Dressrosa, who is motivated only by his desire for revenge; then Zoro, who is about to face Pica alone; and finally Luffy, riding his faithful Ucy with Law and the inseparable Jeet and Abdullah, who are on board. The latter face the wrath of the Straw Hat, who wants to personally settle the score with Doflamingo.\nBaby 5 suddenly notices Se\u00f1or Pink\u0027s absence. Machvise explains that their friend has gone in search of Franky in order to fight him. Indeed, the cyborg from the Straw Hat Crew is running breathlessly towards the Smiles Factory with the aim of destroying it. But his plan is blocked by Se\u00f1or Pink.\nAt the same time, Kyros emerges from his hiding place to face the armed men who are looking for him, not to pocket the bounty promised on his head, but to put an end to this terrible game set up by Doflamingo. But instead of surrendering, the former Colis\u00e9e Corrida champion flees and continues his vengeful struggle. For their part, the group led by Luffy continue their advance to the Royal Palace. Jeet and Abdullah are worried about Zoro, who has stayed behind to fight Pica. The Straw Hat reassures them that his friend won\u0027t lose. Indeed, Zoro fights fiercely against his adversary. The latter can do nothing against him, as all his attacks are countered by Zoro\u0027s fencing skills. Zoro continues to mock the high-pitched voice of his opponent, who tries everything in his power to kill him, without the slightest success.\nAs they make their way towards the Palais Royal, Law, who had been keeping to himself, reveals to Luffy that the real aim of his strategy was to kill Doflamingo and that, although he had been beaten in their first encounter, it would be different next time. He ends his confession by adding that the \u0022Young Master\u0022 had taken away his benefactor 13 years ago, Corazon, former commander-in-chief of the Donquichotte Family and Doflamingo\u0027s own brother!\nNot far away, Robin and his group have safely reached the King\u0027s Plateau. While Bartolomeo desperately searches for his idol Luffy, everyone takes a well-deserved rest. Leo is horrified to discover that the Royal Palace has been moved and is now in a place inaccessible to him and his companions. Suddenly, Viola brings them a glimmer of hope, telling them that she has managed to find the key to Trafalgar Law\u0027s Sea Granite handcuffs. Rebecca, for her part, is thrilled to see her aunt back in good health, as are the Dwarves of the Tontattas tribe, who are delighted to see their ally again. The latter explains to her father, former King Riku, that the Straw Hats are their last hope of restoring freedom to Dressrosa, and that neither the Navy nor the World Government can be counted on to bring peace to their country. This hope should come through the outright elimination of Doflamingo, who has caused the kingdom so much harm over the last ten years. Leo agrees with the princess and proves it by introducing the former king to Riku Ussop, who has become their hero after breaking Sugar\u0027s curse that has turned so many people into toys. And even though Luffy\u0027s companions are pirates, lawless beings, Leo assures Riku that they will always have their trust until the end.\nRebecca, who witnesses the scene, asks her aunt\u0027s permission to hand over the key to Luffy. Viola is astonished by this request and finally agrees, even though she knows that her niece is wanted all over the island. At the same time, Bartolomeo insists on accompanying the young gladiatrix on her venture, as he is desperate to see Luffy again. Leo and his companions are also on board, advising their allies to use the rooftops to get to the palace. Inhel, one of the dwarves, informs them that Fraland is fighting Se\u00f1or Pink at the entrance to the Smiles Factory. The Dwarves will take advantage of this fight to free Princess Mansherry and their comrades, who are still imprisoned in the building.\nMeanwhile, Luffy and his companions eventually reach the first level, where numerous soldiers are waiting to confront them. The latter fire at them, but their bullets are stopped by Straw Hat\u0027s elastic body, which sends them flying back. Thrilled by this victory, Luffy is more eager than ever to defeat Doflamingo once and for all...",

At the same time, Ideo and his friends climb the outer wall of the palace to reach the top, where some members of the Doflamingo family are standing. Dellinger, who witnesses the scene, takes fright, but his companions, Lao G, Machvise, Gladius and Baby 5, remain impassive. Suddenly, they hear from the guards on the first level that Luffy is already there, clearing a path to quickly reach Doflamingo\u0027s location, much to the delight of Jeet and Abdullah, who are still accompanying the Straw Hat on Ucy\u0027s back.\nNot far away, the Navy soldiers and Fujitora face Sabo, ready to do battle with them. Unafraid of fear, Luffy\u0027s brother uses his new gifts to defeat his opponents. The latter discover that this eminent member of the Revolutionary Army is invulnerable to their assaults, and that he is gifted with incredible strength, enabling him to break blades with his bare hands and easily bend the barrels of rifles!\nVice-Admiral Bastille sees that his men are in dire straits, and decides to fight Sabo by demonstrating his sword, the \u0022Shark Slicer\u0022. Unfortunately, he is no match for him and is quickly defeated. Just as Sabo is about to defeat his opponent, he sees Admiral Fujitora use his powers to conjure up a huge meteorite. The meteorite heads for Dressrosa, but is held back by the bars of Doflamingo\u0027s Birdcage, which cut it in two. The pieces break through the barrier and fall on the island, creating even more chaos. Issho tries to apologize for his blunder, while Sabo reveals that he is Luffy\u0027s brother, just as he was with Ace with the Burning Fists. At this news, the Navy troops lose their composure as Sabo explains to Fujitora that he will always be there to lend Luffy a hand when he asks.\nAfter this new revelation, Issho has no choice but to fight Sabo. As he is about to face his opponent, he reminisces about his childhood with Luffy and Ace as children.

Opposite them, Doflamingo\u0027s guards try to bring down the fighting bull on which the Straw Hat is standing, but the latter won\u0027t let them. Knocking at every opportunity, the young pirate managed to clear a path and eventually approached the mountain on top of which lies Doflamingo\u0027s new Royal Palace. On his way, he crosses paths with Cavendish, who is determined to eliminate Doflamingo personally. He is soon followed by Hajrudin, Ideo, Orlumbus, Blue Gilly and Xai, who also want to kill the master of Dressrosa. As for Luffy, he has to face Doflamingo\u0027s guards again, who try to shoot Ucy. Ucy easily dodges their shots, and the Straw Hat\u0027s companions attack their assailants.\nThey are soon supported by the Funk Brothers, who reveal that they have discovered a secret passage leading directly to the Field of Flowers in front of the Palace. As they follow their new ally, Trafalgar Law tells Luffy of his desire to be freed from his Sea Granite handcuffs, but his friend refuses to return to the King\u0027s Plateau to search for the key, preferring to continue on their way.\nLuffy and his group enter the tunnel after thanking Kelly Funk warmly, but in their haste, Jeet and Abdullah lose their balance and fall off Ucy. Now just the two of them on the fighting bull\u0027s back, Luffy and Law make rapid progress through the secret passage. As they make their way towards the Sunflower Field, Luffy receives a snail phone call from Robin, who informs him that Leo, Bartolomeo, Rebecca and herself will soon be joining him to give him the key to unlock Trafalgar Law\u0027s handcuffs.\nAs the savvy leader of the Tontattas\u0027 army, Leo knows how to transport Robin and his friends quickly to the Sunflower Fields while Kelly Funk, who wants to kill the Straw Hat, intends to set a trap for Luffy. At the same time, on the former royal plateau, Bartolomeo, Robin and Rebecca use an unorthodox method to get to the Sunflower Field by flying over the city\u0027s rooftops with the help of beetles kindly provided by Leo and Kabu.\nNot far away, in front of the Smile Factory, the dwarves led by Inhel join forces with Franky to open the building\u0027s doors, but the carpenter from the Straw Hat Crew has his work cut out with Se\u00f1or Pink still blocking his way. For his part, Zoro is still battling Pica, who is using his stone man powers against him.\nMeanwhile, at the entrance to the tunnel leading to the Sunflower Field, Kelly Funk and her men are assaulted by a mysterious force, while Luffy and Law realize that the shortcut provided by the Funk Brothers turns out to be a water-filled dead end, and that Doflamingo himself is coming up behind them...",

After realizing that the two pirates had once again joined forces to fight him, the ruler of Dressrosa uses his powers to shoot down Ucy and plunge Luffy and his friend into the vulnerable water. With them at his mercy, Doflamingo\u0027s ambush of Luffy and Law is short-lived. The King of Dressrosa is violently skewered by Abdullah and Jeet, who are stunned to discover that they were dealing with a common clone!\nAt the same time, Kyros continues his advance through the city streets. All around him is chaos. As he howls his hatred of Doflamingo once again, a pirate who covets his promised bounty on his head prepares to shoot the former Coliseum Corrida champion. But his shot is deflected by an old man who doesn\u0027t want Kyros killed. Exasperated, the man who wanted to kill Kyros points his gun at the old man and decides to shoot him. However, Kyros stops him and quickly overcomes his killer. The old man takes advantage of the situation to grab the gun and point it at Kyros in order to capture him. But the former captain of the royal guard cannot do this and explains to the old man that the people of Dressrosa are peaceful. After this incident, he takes leave of the old man and continues on his way.\nIn the tunnel, Luffy thanks Jeet and Abdullah for pulling him out of the water. His two saviors tell him that Kerry Funk, who had betrayed them, was himself betrayed in return by Doflamingo! Luffy decides to create his own shortcut to the Sunflower Field.\nAt the same time, Kyros arrives on level 1, where the Royal Palace used to be, and hears the voice of the Straw Hat, who is about to create his own shortcut. Meanwhile, on level 2, where the Palais Royal now stands, Dellinger notices that the former gladiators of the Coliseum Corrida are making mincemeat of any Doflamingo guards who dare oppose them. Lao G and his companions decide to take them on one by one.\nCavendish\u0027s horse, Farle, takes fright. He witnesses a prodigy: Luffy\u0027s enormous fist, soaked in fluid, pierces right through the ground where his master and his allies are standing. In fact, the Straw Hat has decided to use the Elephant Gun technique to cut his way through the open air. Don Chinjao and his friends are stunned by this maneuver, as is Kyros, who arrives at the tunnel. Taking advantage of the confusion on the King\u0027s Plateau, Luffy takes Trafalgar Law with him, leaving his faithful and ailing Ucy in the care of Jeet and Abdullah. Reaching the second level, Luffy and Law find themselves surrounded by Doflamingo\u0027s men, but this situation doesn\u0027t stop the young pirate. He\u0027s determined to reach the ruler of Dressrosa and put him out of his misery.\nMeanwhile, on the other side of town, the battle between Fujitora and Sabo continues to rage. The Admiral of the Navy and the second-in-command of the Revolutionary Army are of equal strength, despite the power of their respective Demon Fruits.\nNot far away, in front of the Smiles Factory, the dwarves led by Inhel call Franky to inform him that they have found a way to unlock the building\u0027s heavy door. The carpenter of the Straw Hat Crew is happy to hear this, but he has a lot on his plate with Se\u00f1or Pink. The latter attacks him once again, and the cyborg has no choice but to fight him off, while in town, residents spot Robin, Bartolomeo and Rebecca in the sky, being transported by the Tontatta tribe\u0027s squadron of beetles. They shoot the three escapees in the hope of pocketing the bounty promised on their heads. They are prevented from doing so by Bartolomeo, who has decided to pull down his pants and urinate on them as he had done during the Coliseum Corrida tournament. On seeing this, their assailants take fright and flee.\nAt the same time, on level 4, Bellamy reaches the top of the Royal Palace and crosses the immense Sunflower Field. He demands an answer from Doflamingo regarding the orders to assassinate him. Doflamingo, amused by throwing into the air one of the keys that opens the Sea Granite doors of the Smiles Factory, is interrupted by Trebol, who asks if he has recently sent one of his clones to the lower town. The master of Dressrosa replies that he has. Then, in the company of his senior officers, Diamante and Trebol, he recalls his first meeting with Trafalgar Law, when the latter was still a child, a child who wanted to join his crew and who was driven only by a destructive rage, wanting to wipe out men, women and children who dared to stand in his way because, as a native of Flevance, the White City, he no longer had anything to live for...",

        "description": "Bellamy goes to the Palais Royal where Doflamingo is sitting. He demands an answer from Doflamingo concerning Dellinger, who was ordered to kill him in the basement of the Coliseum Corrida. The King of Dressrosa laughs at him and explains that their goals are different: while Bellamy wants to become a full-fledged pirate, Doflamingo wants to destroy the world. Meanwhile, in front of the piles of rocks that have accumulated below the Palace, Luffy carries Law on his shoulder and makes his way up to the King\u0027s Plateau, while the main agents of the Don Quixote Family move to halt the advance of the Colosseum army: Dellinger defeats Suleyman by digging his horns into his torso, Gladius prevents Don Chinjao from climbing up by shattering the stones he uses for support with explosive charges, Machvise attacks Boo by crushing him with all his weight, Lao G takes down Orlombus despite his great age and Baby 5 confronts Dagama by machine-gunning him on sight.\nAt the same time, in the small town of Sevio, some inhabitants, manipulated by Doflamingo\u0027s power, go mad and try to murder their own families. But armed men are on hand to prevent the worst from happening, quickly overpowering the madmen.\nNot far away, on the King\u0027s Plateau, Usopp has fully recovered from his wounds and is once again alert. He supports Riku in the face of Doflamingo\u0027s attempts to create chaos among the people of Dressrosa, and assures him that Luffy will do everything in his power to prevent this. Suddenly, however, a group of citizens track down Usopp and King Riku. They decide to capture them alive and use them as bargaining chips to lure the other fugitives and put an end to Doflamingo\u0027s deadly game.\nMeanwhile, in the rubbish dump beneath the King\u0027s Plateau, Kinemon is desperately searching for his friend Kanjuro, oblivious to the people with him. The samurai suddenly hears a dull, inhuman growl that terrifies all his companions in misfortune, while at the Smiles Factory, the captured dwarves are going through hell. An overseer punishes them for the slightest misdeed, forcing them to produce more fruit and making them believe they are needed to heal Princess Mansherry, who is extremely ill. But the intervention of the Pink Bee Squadron, led by Bee Anne, changes all that. With the help of her winged friends, Inhel and Wicca, she delivers a message. She wants the captive dwarves to open the factory gates and revolt against their captors. The latter enthusiastically comply, after discovering that they had been fooled about Princess Manshelly\u0027s supposed illness.\nAt the same time, on level 2, the members of the Colosseum army are being decimated one by one by the various officers of the Doflamingo Family. It\u0027s at this point that Luffy arrives and continues to run towards the Royal Palace, still carrying his friend Law on his back. He is soon helped by Cavendish, who invites him to climb on his faithful horse Farle to get to the third level more quickly. The Straw Hat doesn\u0027t hesitate, and climbs onto the animal without even thanking his savior. As they ride towards the lair of their common enemy, they realize that Kyros is also present on the horse. He solemnly announces that he intends to kill Diamante, who is in the Royal Palace. He also asserts that he can\u0027t lose with his real body, and as they make their way to the palace, the gladiators form a barrage against Doflamingo\u0027s guards to clear the way for Luffy and his companions under Dagama\u0027s orders...",

        "description": "Just as Cavendish, Kyros, Law and Luffy are about to reach the third level, they are stopped in their tracks by Gladius. Gladius orders Doflamingo\u0027s guards to attack them, but they are stopped by Elizabello II and Blue Gilly, who neutralize them instantly. Hajrudin also lends a hand, using his enormous club to send a few of Gladius\u0027 men to the other end of the island. When all danger has passed, Dagama orders Cavendish to take the Straw Hat to the Royal Palace on his horse. The Magnificent Pirate Captain carries out this order without a hint of bitterness. However, the opposing troops reorganize under the combined leadership of the various officers of the Doflamingo Family. This turn of events does not frighten Cavendish, who asks Farle to go ahead no matter what. Gladius tries to stop them, but is prevented by Xai, who gets into a fierce fight with him. At the same time, Ideo also joins in the fight, but he comes up against Lao G, who supports his colleague Gladius. For her part, Baby 5 is not idle. Using her power, she attacks Don Chinjao and Orlombus. Xai\u0027s grandfather doesn\u0027t give in and rushes with all his strength at the young woman, who manages to dodge his attack. Not far away, Elizabello II confronts young Dellinger, who can\u0027t help but mock the King of Prodence, whom he deems too slow for his taste. But, just as happened to Suleyman, Elizabello bites the dust. Just as he is about to be finished off by Dellinger, Hajrudin comes to his rescue and scares off this dangerous adversary. Grumbling at having missed, the powerful Elbaf warrior becomes the unwilling target of Machvise, who crushes him with all his weight before Elizabello\u0027s helpless eyes.\nWhile their allies battle the guards to cover their escape, Luffy, Kyros, Law and Cavendish continue their advance to the Royal Palace. Doflamingo\u0027s guards try to stop them, but to no avail. For their part, Dagama and the former gladiators of the Colis\u00e9e Corrida join Cavendish\u0027s group to lend them a hand. But Dellinger doesn\u0027t want that to happen and runs towards Dagama to plant his horns in his chest. The attack is devastating, but the King of Prodence\u0027s military advisor escapes unscathed and orders Luffy and his friends to continue on their way to the top of the Royal Palace. Obeying his wish, the Straw Hat and his comrades make their way to Doflamingo\u0027s lair despite heavy fire from their opponents. Cavendish is forced to draw Durandal from its scabbard to cut a path through the ramparts, while Luffy uses his gifts to cut down their pursuers.\nFar from the hustle and bustle, in the rubbish dump below the Executive Tower, Kinemon is intrigued by bulging noises that terrify his companions in misfortune around him. Eager to get to the bottom of this, the samurai goes to the source of the mysterious noises and finds his friend Kanjuro hiding behind a wall. The two samurai have an emotional reunion. Kanjuro remembers the last time he saw Kinemon, when Momonosuke was kidnapped by Caesar Clown\u0027s henchmen and taken by force to Punk Hazard. His companion had set off in pursuit of his son, leaving him in Dressrosa in the hands of Doflamingo\u0027s men. After recalling these painful memories, Kanjuro decides to get out of the dump and begins to draw a sparrow on a wall of their prison with the huge brush he has on his back, before the incredulous eyes of his companions. Soon his drawing comes to life after the samurai uses his powers to amaze everyone. Riding this strange animal, Kanjuro invites Kinemon to join him in getting out of the dump. The former toys, mostly soldiers from King Riku\u0027s royal guard and a few civilians, ask them to leave with them. The samurai complies and helps them escape from their prison by climbing ladders he had drawn with his own hands.\nNot far away, on the outskirts of the Royal Palace, Cavendish and Luffy continue to confront Doflamingo\u0027s guards, who try at all costs to stop them by shooting at them. However, they are supported by the Colosseum army, led by Blue Gilly, who eliminate the last remaining resistance one by one. But the latter has to face Dellinger, who violently punches him in the throat before Luffy\u0027s astonished eyes. Luffy can\u0027t come to his aid, as he absolutely must reach the top of the Royal Palace to fight Doflamingo. Cavendish reminds Luffy of the importance of this crucial mission, remembering the Dressrosa ruler\u0027s speech before his terrible game began. His ally reveals that the Birdcage their enemy had created was a deception, as it prevents any information from leaving Dressrosa. Cavendish also explains that the revelation of the island\u0027s arms trade and the secret of the toys have condemned all Dressrosa\u0027s inhabitants to death! Thanks to this prison of wires, the island is isolated and cut off from the world. The only way to change this situation is to kill Doflamingo. As he spoke, Dellinger, having defeated Blue Gilly, challenged Ideo while Machvise crushed Boo and challenged Hajrudin to a duel, while Baby 5 challenged Xai. While continuing to ride, Cavendish confesses to Luffy that it will be he who slays Doflamingo. This admission angers the Straw Hat, but also Kyros and Law, who are also after the life of the current ruler of Dressrosa. As they bicker and bicker, the four fighters soon reach the third level, where through a thick fog they see huge, strange puppets blocking their way...",

        "description": "Luffy, Cavendish, Kyros and Law have to contend with grimacing nutcrackers blocking their way to the Royal Palace, where Doflamingo is staying. The latter begin to advance in their direction. Cavendish orders his horse, Farle, to run through them to escape. The animal obeys his master when suddenly one of the puppets falls face down. Believing himself to be dealing with huge, clumsy toys, the nutcracker rears his grinning head and quickly crawls towards Farle, who rears back in terror as he sees the terrifying metal monster approaching. The nutcracker lunges at Luffy to tear his head off, but the Straw Hat is faster than he is and manages to dodge his attack. Cavendish orders his companions to be vigilant, as he has noticed that other nutcrackers are beginning to stroll dangerously in their direction, as if intent on attacking them.\nNot far away, on the Stone Golem, Zoro and Pica continue to fight fiercely, and soon the Straw Hat Crew swordsman has the advantage over his opponent. The Pirate Hunter suddenly notices Bartolomeo, Robin and Rebecca flying through the air. Pica sees them too and tries to attack, but Zoro understands the extent of his power. He uses one of his most powerful attack techniques, which slices the huge Golem\u0027s massive body in two. Having done this, Zoro explains to Pica, offended at having been defeated, that he will be the man who will one day become the world\u0027s greatest swordsman, as Bartolomeo looks on with tears in his eyes.\nMeanwhile, in the Smiles factory, the oppressed dwarves revolt against their former jailers who are powerless to stop them, while one of them, Mouji, believes she has finally found Princess Mansherry. Unfortunately, she is not in the factory. Meanwhile, one of the guards warns Shuuin, the factory manager, that the dwarves have just revolted. Armed with a huge vacuum cleaner, Shuuin leaves her office to put down the rebellion. As she makes her way towards the insurgents, they inflict heavy casualties on the factory guards, who fire on them. The guards are outnumbered, and can do nothing against the agility and speed of their smaller opponents.\nAfter preventing the guards from calling for reinforcements by snail phone, the dwarves, led by their leader, attempt to unlock the Smiles factory\u0027s front door, while Mouji learns that Princess Mansherry was not ill. He immediately sets off in search of her, taking some twenty of his co-religionists with him in his suite. The dwarves, led by Mouji, overpower the guards and soon arrive in a room to which they are forbidden access and which bears the name of their princess. After breaking down the door, they sadly realize that Mansherry is not inside, and bitterly realize that they have been fooled.\nAt the same time, the other dwarves are about to open the doors of the Smiles factory. In front of them, Franky battles with Se\u00f1or Pink, who seems invulnerable. However, the cyborg manages to fool him into believing that an old woman needs him. For their part, the dwarves are still trying to open the factory gates when Shuuin arrives armed with her vacuum cleaner. She uses it to capture the dwarves who try to flee at the sight of her, but to no avail. One by one, Mouji\u0027s friends are sucked into Shuuin\u0027s immense machine, and she laughs with delight at seeing her enemies reduced to her mercy. Just when all seems lost, the doors suddenly open and the dwarves are relieved to see Franky enter the building and flash a big, mocking smile at the Smiles factory manager, who can\u0027t believe her eyes...",

        "description": "Far from her friends, who are looking for her everywhere, Princess Mansherry is locked up in a dungeon, crying her eyes out for someone to free her. At the same time, Franky has managed to open the doors of the Smiles Factory, much to the amazement of Shuuin, the factory manager, who was busy capturing the dwarves with her huge vacuum cleaner. The dwarves are thrilled to see the cyborg, who hadn\u0027t come alone. He was accompanied by other dwarves, who were delighted to find their captive friends. This tender reunion moves Franky, who also cries with joy. Bomba suddenly asks Mouji if he has found Mansherry. The latter, sheepishly, tells him that he had looked all over the factory for her, at the risk of being captured by the guards, but unfortunately the dwarf princess was nowhere to be found.\nAs Franky asks his friends who Princess Mansherry was, Shuuin, who hates being ignored, reminds them. She tries to catch dwarfs again with her vacuum cleaner, but Franky stops her. Having recognized the carpenter from the Straw Hat Crew, she asks him where Se\u00f1or Pink has been. Franky explains that he has managed to fool one of the most esteemed officers of the Doflamingo Family into believing that an old grandmother needs his help. Irritated by this deception, Shuuin tries to hit Franky with her vacuum cleaner, but the cyborg stops his gesture by taking the factory manager in his arms, much to the Dwarves\u0027 surprise.\nNot far away, on level 3, where the Palais Royal stands, Cavendish, Luffy and Kyros are stopped in their tracks by head-busting dolls. Seeing that the only way through is to defeat these grimacing lead soldiers, the three men step forward to confront them. The fight is not long in coming, as a nutcracker is already attacking them. The three fighters defend themselves and manage to defeat several of their opponents. But there are so many of them that they put up violent resistance.\nAt the same time, in the Smile Factory, Shuuin tries to break Franky\u0027s grip, but to no avail. For his part, Se\u00f1or Pink has realized the deception and retraces his steps back to the factory. Speeding towards the cyborg, who at the same time knocks the factory manager to the ground, Franky manages to knock the two members of the Don Quixote family into each other, causing them to faint at the same time, much to the astonishment of the dwarves. But Shuuin isn\u0027t completely knocked out, and gets up angrily with a large bump on his head. With the firm intention of making him pay for this affront, the factory manager wishes Franky dead. But Franky doesn\u0027t let her get away with it, and calms her down with a passionate kiss on the mouth. Under the effect of this kiss, Shuuin falls madly in love with Franky, who couldn\u0027t care less about her. For his part, Se\u00f1or Pink comes to and quietly addresses his opponent. The two men, equally hard-bitten, agree that this woman disgusts them to the core, before embarking on a third round just as violent as the previous ones.\nNot far away, on level 3, Luffy, Cavendish and Kyros have emerged victorious from their battle with the nutcrackers, but the latter have not said their last word. At the same time, in front of the Plateau, at the site of the Pica statue, Zoro continues his duel with the Stone Man. Frustrated at not having been able to stop Rebecca and her friends, Pica fiercely attacks Zoro to make him pay for his insolence. However, the swordsman of the Straw Hat Crew is an excellent fencer and dodges every blow from his increasingly enraged opponent. The latter uses his powers to eliminate his enemy, but Zoro is the stronger in this little game. For his part, Bartolomeo, who always accompanies Rebecca and Robin, is thrilled to be able to witness this battle of the titans and savors his pleasure at seeing the prowess of his idol, Zoro. Robin tries to bring him back to reality as they soon approach the second level. Suddenly, L\u00e9o, who is sitting on Rebecca\u0027s shoulder, receives a snail phone call from Mouji informing him that he had been unable to find Princess Mansherry in the factory. This news saddens the dwarf leader.\nAt the same time, on the outskirts of the former King\u0027s Plateau, a group of armed citizens of Dressrosa are determined to capture King Riku and Usopp and stop the cruel game being played by Doflamingo. Meanwhile, Viola informs her father that the Tontattas have contacted him to warn him that they have been unable to find Mansherry. Riku, who believes that the missing princess is in Doflamingo\u0027s lair, asks his daughter to use her abilities to locate her. Viola obeys, while Ussop witnesses Kinemon\u0027s return in the company of his friend Kanjuro. Kanjuro confesses to Ussop that he had unwillingly helped their pursuers, who are now climbing the wall with the help of ropes drawn by Kinemon\u0027s friend, in order to pocket the bounty promised for the capture of Ussop and former king Riku. The latter informs them that Doflamingo will not kill Mansherry because he needs his power too much. For her part, thanks to her Clairvoyance, Viola manages to locate the princess, who is locked in a dark dungeon at the back of the chapel. Crying her eyes out, the princess is desperate to return to Green Bit and pleads with Leo to come and save her...",

Below them, they see the former gladiators of the Coliseum Corrida fighting against the officers of the Doflamingo Family. During their flight, Robin informs his comrades that they must join Luffy and the others who are waiting for them. At the mention of the Straw Hat\u0027s name, Bartolomeo dreams of meeting him and cries with joy when Luffy tells him he\u0027s his friend. Rebecca quickly brings him back to reality, while Leo receives a snail phone call from Viola, who tells him that she has succeeded in finding Princess Mansherry and that she is a prisoner in the Royal Palace, in a room behind the chapel. This is no stranger to the Tontatta army chief, as it was the place where little Viola was locked up as a child. As he reminisces about the past, Leo remembers with emotion the pleasant times he spent with Viola when she was getting into mischief, and also with Rebecca\u0027s mother Scarlett, who used to bring them food on the sly. Now that they knew where to look, Robin and his friends set off to rescue the Dwarf princess.\nAt the same time, on the King\u0027s Plateau, where the Royal Palace stands on the third level, Luffy, Kyros and Cavendish have succeeded in defeating the Headcracker Dolls. Just when they thought they\u0027d defeated them all, one of them bites Farle\u0027s head off, shattering his skull. Luffy avenges Cavendish\u0027s horse by shooting his murderer, who rises to his feet as if nothing had happened. Cavendish and his companions realize that the Nutcracker soldiers they are facing are invincible, and keep getting up in front of them!\nFor his part, Usopp reprimands Kanjuro for his clumsiness. The samurai, at the height of his humiliation, tries to make amends, while Viola, who is with them, warns them that Sugar has woken up. This news panics the Straw Hat Crew sniper, who still remembers how he managed to make Sugar faint. King Riku\u0027s youngest daughter worries about Luffy and his friends, who are in grave danger because they know nothing of the power of this high-ranking officer of the Doflamingo Family. Although she has recovered, Sugar is still traumatized by her recent experience, and screams in terror as soon as she spots a long, pointed nose that reminds her of Usopp\u0027s. She takes revenge by transforming her body into a new one. She takes her revenge by turning her closest associates into Head-Breaker Dolls and sending them off to fight the Straw Hats, whom she blames for Doflamingo\u0027s setbacks. King Riku is extremely worried about this situation, fearing that the people and soldiers of Dressrosa will once again be turned into toys. Usopp himself harbors the same fear, having forgotten Robin\u0027s existence after she was shot by Sugar. Determined not to let this happen to Luffy, he grabs his black kabuto and decides to shoot Sugar from a distance. Viola helps him with her Clairvoyance.\nMeanwhile, Orlombus wreaks havoc on Doflamingo\u0027s guards, who are no match for his whip and Herculean strength. As for Xai, he has to face Baby 5, who proves to be a tough opponent. Not far away, Don Chinjao is forced to fight Lao G who, despite his advanced age, is determined to defend Doflamingo\u0027s interests. Their struggle frightens the guards, who flee in all directions to avoid being killed. Meanwhile, Gladius looks up and notices Robin, Rebecca and Bartolomeo. He decides to shoot them out of the sky as they fly over the third level. Gladius\u0027 first victim is Bartolomeo, and the force of the blast sends Robin tumbling to the ground. She asks Rebecca to reach the fourth level to give Trafalgar Law the key that will free him from his Sea Granite handcuffs.\nWhile his friends are in dire straits, Luffy continues to battle the Headache Dolls, using a highly effective fighting technique to defeat them. But this prowess is no match for the diabolical toys, who all come back to life! Now surrounded, the Straw Hat and his friends soon see no way out. Thinking their fate settled, they suddenly see one of the tin soldiers collapse under the weight of Bartolomeo, who has fallen from the sky! Robin joins him, using the \u0022Cien Fleur: Wing\u0022 technique, which enables him to fly through the air, using his power to grow a hundred arms on his back in the shape of two angel wings. After the reunion, the young archaeologist asks Luffy, Law and Kyros to go to the fourth level, where Rebecca is waiting for them with the keys to Law\u0027s handcuffs. But Gladius, who has fallen at the same time as Bartolomeo, interferes and orders the Headache Dolls to attack them. Despite this threat, Robin decides to stay and face her new enemies, while she orders the Straw Hat to go to the Field of Flowers so that Law can be freed from his chains...",

        "description": "In the company of Kabu and Leo, Rebecca makes it safely to the Flower Field on the fourth level, only to see her friends the Dwarves leave to rescue Princess Manshelly. Once alone, the young woman takes advantage of this moment of respite to plunge back into her memories, recalling her youth with Soldier Lightning Fury. But suddenly she freezes in horror when she sees Diamante, none other than her mother\u0027s killer, advancing before her.\nFor his part, Luffy is attacked by Gladius, who sends him explosive cannonballs, but the projectiles are blocked by Bartolomeo, who creates a protective barrier. Annoyed, Gladius orders two Headcracker Dolls to get rid of this troublemaker, but the Straw Hat doesn\u0027t let him and eliminates these two dangerous threats. To make his idol look good, Bartolomeo comes up with the idea of using the barrier he\u0027s just created as a long staircase leading up to level 4. Luffy begins to climb it, with Trafalgar Law still handcuffed on his back, but the two pirates are attacked by a Headache Doll.\nNot far away, in the lower town, the battle between Sabo and Fujitora continues. The Navy Admiral creates a horizontal force of gravity that pushes Sabo back. The revolutionary wonders if Issho isn\u0027t hiding something important as he continues to fight him, causing immense carnage on the island.\nAt the same time, on the Field of Flowers, Rebecca is terrified by Diamante and, paralyzed by fear, is unable to flee. Her adversary takes advantage of the situation and wounds her with his big sword, while Luffy and Law are still battling with the Headache Dolls. They owe their salvation to Kyros who, after slicing through one of the huge dolls, is the first to climb the stairs. Luffy and Law follow close behind, while Cavendish protects their rear. Cavendish is determined to avenge his horse Farle, who has been mortally wounded by the infamous dolls. Gladius sees the Straw Hat running for the summit and attacks again. But Bartolomeo intervenes and blocks the bombs with his body, risking his own life because he can only use one barrier at a time and all his power is monopolized by the immense one he has just created. Robin thanks him for his gesture and takes over, fighting Gladius\u0027s puppets. While fighting, the young archaeologist informs Cavendish and Bartolomeo that Luffy is still the trump card that will lead them to victory. Meanwhile, the Straw Hat races breathlessly to level 4 to settle Doflamingo\u0027s score once and for all...",

        "description": "Thanks to the staircase created by Bartolomeo, Luffy, still carrying Law on his shoulder, races breathlessly up to the fourth level. He\u0027s determined to catch up with Kyros if he wants to get to the Flower Field first. He really wants to settle the score with Doflamingo and none other than himself. But as he climbs the stairs, Law warns Luffy of the Headache Dolls who are always out to get them. The Straw Hat manages to dodge their attack thanks to his agility. However, instead of continuing to fight them, Trafalgar Law advises his friend to get to the Field of Flowers as quickly as possible, where Rebecca is waiting. Rebecca has to contend with Diamante, who is proving to be an excellent fencer. Despite her long experience with weapons, the young gladiatrix is no match for such a fighter and suddenly loses the key that opens Law\u0027s Sea Granite handcuffs. She quickly finds it, but must face her mother\u0027s killer. Determined to exact her revenge, Rebecca defies Diamante, who has been waiting for this. But at the last second, she gives up and runs off, having retrieved the key to the handcuffs. Her adversary, who doesn\u0027t understand her attitude, pursues her and wounds her after transforming the blade of his sword into a long, sharp strip.\nNow at her mercy, Diamante is about to give her the coup de gr\u00e2ce when he pulls out a pistol, the same weapon that killed the young woman\u0027s mother Scarlett. As he takes aim at her, Rebecca cries out for help. She is saved by the swift intervention of Kyros, who stops Diamante\u0027s move by striking him with his sword. Disconcerted, he hears his adversary cry out angrily that he will not let him take away another member of his family. Rebecca, seeing that the person who had just saved her was missing a leg, deduces that Kyros and the Lightning Fury Soldier are the same person, i.e. not only her protector but also her father. He tells her that she no longer needs to fight. Diamante witnesses these words and, mad with rage, attacks Kyros, who confronts him without faltering. Rebecca watches helplessly as they duel, when she suddenly hears Luffy shout his name. She sees the Straw Hat, carrying Law, coming up the stairs and asks him to give her the key to her friend\u0027s handcuffs. Rebecca complies, but she sees the two pirates being attacked by a Headache Doll who wants to eliminate them. Luffy manages to retrieve the key and free Law\u0027s wrists just in time. Indeed, the Straw Hat and his friend had just been swallowed by the huge puppet before Rebecca\u0027s horrified eyes. Using his powers, Law manages to slice up their assailant, the pieces of which fall on the lower town.\nFor her part, Diamante notices the presence of Luffy and Law, increasing her anger at Kyros. Kyros asks his comrades to take care of Doflamingo for him. The Straw Hat and his ally accept his proposal. On their way to the Royal Palace, Luffy spots Rebecca. He thanks the young gladiator for helping them by handing over the key, and notices that Rebecca is very happy to have found her father at last. Still calling her \u0022Lucy\u0022, Luffy reveals his true identity and his ambition to one day become King of the Pirates. This exasperates Diamante, who wants to kill the two intruders with her own hands. But he is prevented from doing so by Kyros, who has a score to settle with him. This doesn\u0027t stop Diamante from attacking Luffy and Law. The latter saves his friend by teleporting them both inside the palace, much to Diamante\u0027s anger and Rebecca\u0027s relief, who sees her two friends going into battle against a terrible adversary who has oppressed her country for so many years.\nOnce in the Palace garden, Law himself extracts the three lead bullets that Doflamingo had fired at him at point-blank range, using his abilities, while Luffy is ready to settle the score with Doflamingo. The Shichibukai asks the Straw Hat to calm down or he\u0027ll never be able to defeat their opponent. A guard witnesses their conversation and warns Sugar, by snail phone, of the presence of these two intruders on the outskirts of the palace. Sugar takes it upon herself to stop them, as she has every intention of taking revenge on the Straw Hats, and in particular on Usopp for all the evil they had inflicted on her...",

They are determined to capture the fugitives with a price on their heads and deliver them to Doflamingo. Meanwhile, Kinemon\u0027s friend has completed a strange drawing of Usopp. Usopp puts the finishing touches to his plan to kill Sugar for good. Seeking Viola\u0027s help, he asks her to let him know every move their enemy makes, using her Clairvoyance.\nThe youngest daughter of former King Riku uses her Clairvoyance and sees Sugar leaving the Palace to turn Luffy and Law, who were in the courtyard, into toys. Knowing the importance of Usopp\u0027s project, Riku, Tank and Hack do everything in their power to buy him time by slowing down the advance of the Dressrosa citizens who have come to capture them, while doing them no harm. While Viola warns Usopp that Sugar is seeing his two friends, armed men invade the King\u0027s Plateau to stop the fugitives, who are fiercely resisted by Riku, Tank, Hack, Kanjuro and Kinemon.\nAt the same time, Sugar appears in the gardens of the Palais Royal, determined to take revenge for the affront perpetrated by the Straw Hats against her. Knowing that Luffy and Law are unaware of her true power, Sugar pretends to be a helpless little girl and tries to soften them up with her tears. As Usopp tries to target Sugar with his Kabuto Noir, citizens of Dressrosa attempt to break through the security cordon formed by the Straw Hat Crew sniper\u0027s companions to capture him. Outnumbered, Riku and his companions risk losing control at any moment, while Ussop continues to aim. While gathering valuable information from Viola, the sniper, sweating profusely, adjusts the accuracy of his shot as much as possible, while Sugar heads for Luffy and Law to give them her grapes. This is a serious moment. Thanks to Viola\u0027s powers, and Usopp\u0027s fluid, which enables him to sense the aura of his captain as well as those of Law and Sugar, the sniper manages to send his projectile just in time before men-at-arms catch him and tie him up like his other companions. His precise shot hits Sugar directly. When she realizes that the figure sent is Usopp\u0027s, she faints again.\nAs she regains consciousness, Sugar\u0027s curse magically disappears and the Puzzle Dolls attacking Robin, Cavendish and Bartolomeo fall to pieces one after the other. While the palace guards try to revive Sugar, Luffy takes advantage of the situation and takes Law with him to the top floor, where Trebol and Doflamingo await, both ready for the ultimate battle...",

The palace guards try to revive her, but to no avail. At the same time, Gladius finds himself up against Bartolomeo, Robin and Cavendish, who are determined to finish him off, but it\u0027s going to be a tough battle as they come up against one of the toughest officers in the Doflamingo family.\nMeanwhile, on the top floor of the Palais Royal, Luffy spots Bellamy lying unconscious on the floor. As the latter regains consciousness, Doflamingo is surprised by his adversary\u0027s attitude to worry about Bellamy\u0027s state of health, as he was once his enemy in Mock Town. The Straw Hat asserts that this is all in the past. The King of Dressrosa takes advantage of this moment to molest his former right-hand man, while disclosing to Luffy and Law Bellamy\u0027s plan to become one of his crew members. Angered, Luffy tries to hit Doflamingo, but his kick collides with Bellamy\u0027s bloodied face, which Doflamingo had used as a shield. Seeing the situation worsen, Trafalgar Law advises his ally not to get angry, as Doflamingo loves to provoke his enemies. Doflamingo tells them that their alliance had ruined all his plans at Punk Hazard, led to the deaths of Vergo and Mone, the kidnapping of Caesar Clown and the release of Dressrosa\u0027s toys from Sugar\u0027s curse. These misadventures bring back painful memories of 13 years ago, when Law spoiled his plans.\nAfter recalling his past fiascos, Doflamingo sends one of his clones to attack Law, who defends himself as best he can, while Luffy is forced to fight Bellamy, who has been manipulated by his former master. On the second level, the former gladiators of the Colis\u00e9e Corrida continue to fight against Doflamingo\u0027s guards. Don Chinjao has to contend with Lao G, who proves to be a tough opponent even if he has to wear glasses during the fight. For his part, Ideo has a run-in with Dellinger, who hits him with all his might with his feet. Not far away, Hajrudin battles Machvise, who despite his enormous weight, is faster than the giant from Elbaf. At the other end of the level, Sai takes on the beautiful Baby 5, a skilled fighter who uses all her powers to bring down her opponent.\nAt the same time, on level 3, Robin, Bartolomeo and Cavendish are making mincemeat of their opponents, but still have to contend with Gladius, while at the Smiles Factory, the battle between Franky and Se\u00f1or Pink continues to the cheers of their respective fans. The same fierce battle is being waged on the Flower Field, where Kyros duels fiercely with Diamante before Rebecca\u0027s terrified eyes, while Luffy and Law face off against their opponents. Seeing that the only way to finish off Doflamingo is to attack him head-on, Luffy rushes to Law\u0027s aid, who creates a bubble with his power that completely envelops the Doflamingo clone and switches places with the real Doflamingo. The Straw Hat takes advantage of this ruse to deliver a lightning blow to the ruler of Dressrosa in the stomach, leaving Trebol speechless. Law neutralizes him by cutting him to pieces with his sword, while Luffy hits Doflamingo with all his might, having learned from the Corsair Captain that they are both the worst pirates of their generation...",

For his part, Trebol worries about his fate but is held in check by Law, while Bellamy, who has been watching the whole scene, is blown away by the Straw Hat\u0027s performance. However, Doflamingo has not said his last word and is plotting his revenge. Drunk with anger, he creates a new clone that attacks Luffy. Luffy dodges and activates his Haki to prepare for battle. The Straw Hat\u0027s fight against the fake Doflamingo is fierce, but Luffy wants to fight the real one, who activates his clone like a common puppet.\nMeanwhile, on a street in the capital of Dressrosa, Sabo recalls Fujitora\u0027s words after his battle with the Admiral. He is quickly brought back to reality by Koala, who reprimands him by telling him that he shouldn\u0027t fight a naval officer so as not to draw attention to the Revolutionary Army. Not far away, on the King\u0027s Plateau, Usopp, King Riku and his friends are captured by the citizens of Dressrosa. Just when they thought they had everything under control, a group of pirates burst in to kill Usopp and pocket the bounty promised on his head. But the citizens of Dresrosa stop them, as they want to use their prisoners as hostages to stop Doflamingo\u0027s deadly game. Noticing that the pirates are refusing to cooperate and are beating up innocent people, Riku steps in and beats up the pirate leader. Riku calls for reinforcements, while the former ruler of Dressrosa cuts Hack and Tank loose to help him fight the pirates. Having defeated their opponents by binding them tightly, Riku finds that his former subjects are begging him to help them overthrow Doflamingo. The former ruler of Dressrosa advises them to trust Luffy, who is the only one capable of defeating Doflamingo. To everyone\u0027s surprise, Admiral Fujitora, who had joined them, also declares his confidence in the Straw Hat.\nMeanwhile, on top of the Royal Palace, Luffy battles Doflamingo and his clone using all his most powerful fighting techniques. Unfortunately, the Straw Hat is no match for them, while Law attacks Trebol. Seeing that this lawless pirate was attacking a member of his family, Doflamingo paralyzes him and inflicts small holes in Law\u0027s shoulder. For his part, Luffy tries to rescue his friend, but Doflamingo quickly subdues his new adversary by binding his hands with wires and manipulating Bellamy into hitting Luffy with his swords. Once this danger has been averted, the Shichibukai takes the opportunity to tell them about his childhood, when he was still a Celestial Dragon before his father gave up his Tenryuubito privileges to lead the simple life of a human being, a situation unbearable for the young Doflamingo who, at the age of ten, killed his father with his own hands! From that day on, Doflamingo had a fierce hatred for the whole world, and vowed to destroy it for all the evil the Celestial Dragons had inflicted on his family...",

Suffering cruelly from the absence of Admiral Fujitora, Vice-Admiral Maynard\u0027s men have to contend alone, with tranquilizer rounds, with furious animals rampaging through the streets, associated with citizens manipulated by Doflamingo, and pirates pillaging at every turn.\nAt the same time, at the top of the Royal Palace, Luffy, his hands tied behind his back, must fight both a Doflamingo clone and Bellamy, who is still controlled by the island\u0027s master, while Trafalgar Law questions the latter\u0027s ability to manipulate CP0 and the World Government. Doflamingo explains to his opponent that he knows the nature of a national treasure hidden on the Holy Land of Marie-Joie that the Celestial Dragons don\u0027t want to reveal to the whole world, and uses it to blackmail them while granting him their power. Doflamingo is thus aware of the full potential of the Surgeon\u0027s Fruit held by Law, as this very special Demon Fruit can grant eternal life in exchange for an operation, called the \u0022Surgery of Perpetual Youth\u0022, which sacrifices the life of its user. However, Law is not inclined to use his power on himself, and confesses that it is thanks to Corazon that he has the chance of one day defeating Doflamingo as he fights fiercely against him.\nAs he battles Doflamingo, Trafalgar Law recalls his past, when 16 years ago he discovered he had only three years to live. This short life expectancy had motivated his desire for destruction. A native of the White City, young Law, who was only 10 at the time, was one of the rookies who had recently joined Doflamingo\u0027s crew, which was stationed at Spider Miles, a port town in North Blue, under the command of Corazon, a clumsy but talented officer and Doflamingo\u0027s own brother. Law learned that his superior hated children and, one day, he was thrown out of a window in front of young Baby 5 and Buffalo. Law managed to get up from the fall, his face bloodied, and swore to kill Corazon, who had dared to mistreat him while the latter had caught fire after lighting a cigarette...",

During a banquet, his new companions discover that Law is the sole survivor of Flevance, a once prosperous country that no longer exists.\nAs the pirates in Doflamingo\u0027s pay continued their murderous raids on Rakesh, an island that had betrayed their trust by allying itself with groups other than them, Baby 5, who had accompanied them, asks Gladius to explain Law\u0027s origins in detail as they quietly strip corpses for their money. He revealed that their new companion had come from the \u0022White City\u0022. This place was so called because of a special lead, called \u0022Saturn\u0027s White\u0022 or ceruse, which was the source of wealth for all the island\u0027s inhabitants. But a century ago, the World Government discovered that this substance was toxic and decided to keep this information secret because of the immense wealth that Saturn White could bring.\nHiding the truth for decades, this extraordinary material began to wreak havoc on the population of the Kingdom of Flevance, causing shortened life spans and painful deaths. The neighboring kingdoms, fearing that the contagion would reach them, decided to quarantine Flevance by closing their borders with it. The country\u0027s royal rulers were the first to be evacuated, while ordinary citizens were mercilessly slaughtered by squads of soldiers sent to exterminate them, despite their efforts to resist. Law was at this time in the company of his younger sister Lamy and her parents. Law\u0027s father, who was a doctor like his wife, tried to find a cure for the disease that affected all his friends and his beloved, martyred daughter. But tragedy struck Trafalgar Law\u0027s parents when Navy soldiers, dressed in protective suits, invaded the hospital where they were working. The young boy saw that they had been murdered to prevent the spread of lead poisoning. But he was soon discovered by soldiers who tried to kill him by shooting him on sight. Law miraculously escaped his pursuers by hiding under a bridge. Alone and distraught, wandering among hundreds of corpses in the burning city, Law discovered that he was the sole survivor of Flevance.\nAfter Gladius has completed his tale, Baby 5 is shocked to learn of Trafalgar Law\u0027s painful story. She understands why the young boy, filled with anger, had a grudge against the whole world. In Spider Miles, who was not part of the punitive expedition to Rakesh, notices that Corazon, who was supposed to be watching him, was quietly reading a newspaper. Law takes advantage of the situation to attack him from behind, stabbing him through the heart. Unfortunately for him, Buffalo witnessed the scene and reported everything to Doflamingo, who had decreed a rule, \u0022the law of blood\u0022, according to which anyone who dared to touch a single hair on his brother\u0027s head would be impaled by his hand on the spot...",

All the inhabitants of the island where they had taken refuge wanted to pay for the Tenry\u00fbbito\u0027s crimes through them. Covered in sweat, the head of the Doflamingo Family wakes up with a start to the sound of a snail\u0027s buzzer, informing him of the assassination attempt on his brother Corazon.

However, Doflamingo declares that he will become an official member of his crew. He goes on to say that if Law himself finds a Demon Fruit capable of curing him of his illness, he will arrange for him to become his right-hand man in the very near future. Law then witnesses a scene in which Corazon lies to Doflamingo about his injury in order to protect him.\nThe next two years were devoted to Law\u0027s apprenticeship, as he accompanied Doflamingo\u0027s crew in all their acts of piracy in order to train himself.

Meanwhile, the wounded Trafalgar Law continues his duel with the real Doflamingo. During the battle, the privateer captain recalls his childhood days. He remembers that he and Corazon were contacted by snail phone by Doflamingo, who asked them to return to him after a six-month absence. He intended to steal the Ope Ope no Mi from under the noses of the World Government and the Navy and give it to his brother, unaware that the latter had already eaten a Demon Fruit. After hanging up, Corazon is overjoyed by this news and informs Law that the Ope Ope no Mi is the ultimate remedy for his young friend\u0027s ailment. Corazon also confesses that he intends to give this Demon Fruit to Law by stealing it before Doflamingo does, as the latter has the necessary medical knowledge to use it properly. In fact, Doflamingo suspects his own brother of being a traitor to his own family and working undercover for the Navy.\nCorazon then makes a snail phone call to Sengoku, who is in the company of Vice-Admiral Garp, informing him that his brother\u0027s crew is on Swallow Island, so that Navy soldiers can arrest them all.

        "description": "While Vice-Admiral Tsuru, stationed with her female troops on Rubeck Island, off Swallow Island where the exchange is to take place, orders Navy soldiers to continue guarding the Diez Barrels pirate base on Minion Island unseen, Don Quixote Rossinante, Doflamingo\u0027s brother, has managed to retrieve the Ope Ope no Mi but has been seriously wounded during a scuffle with Barrels\u0027 men. Finding Law unconscious, he takes him in his arms to escape as far as Ghost Town, the pirates\u0027 hideout, which is engulfed in flames. Once out of danger from their pursuers, Corazon gives Law the Ope Ope no Mi, forcing him to swallow it by force so that the young boy can be cured of the disease that is eating away at him. In doing so, Trafalgar Law becomes an unwilling user of Demon Fruit.\nSuddenly, Corazon collapses bleeding at his friend\u0027s feet. Law tries to heal him using his new powers, but to no avail. Before Corazon loses consciousness, he hands Law a letter he must give to a Navy officer, containing important information that could lead to the arrest of Don Quixote\u0027s crew, Doflamingo. But fate is once again against Law, for the first officer he meets on his way is none other than Vergo, his protector\u0027s sworn enemy. Begging him to save the dying Corazon, Vergo is guided by Law to his friend. Corazon catches sight of Vergo and is paralyzed with fear. Vergo bluntly punches Corazon in the face, ignoring his condition as Law looks on helplessly. Having reduced Law to impotence, Vergo beats Corazon to a pulp, risking his life by using the powers of his haki. For his part, Law can do nothing to save his friend, who is being martyred by this cruel man. Law begged him to stop, but he suffered the same fate even though he was still a child. When Law had finished his task, Doflamingo contacted him by snail phone to inform him that Corazon was a spy working for the Navy and that he was currently on Minion Island. Doflamingo immediately sets off with his entire crew, while Corazon and Law manage to vanish under Vergo\u0027s nose using the boy\u0027s new powers.\nDoflamingo and his group arrive on the island. Corazon\u0027s evil brother uses his gifts to create a cage of hard, sharp wires to capture the two fugitives and retrieve the Demon Fruit they had the audacity to steal from him. Corazon witnesses this prodigy and, knowing that his days are numbered, will do everything in his power to save Law from his brother\u0027s clutches, even if it means dying with a smile on his face...",

        "description": "Chaos reigns on Minion Island, and Navy soldiers have noticed that a huge cage has covered the entire island. Inside this impenetrable dome, the pirates trapped there are fighting each other as if driven by an all-powerful force. Doflamingo tracks down Diez Barrels and kills him to take back the Ope Ope no Mi. But he discovers that the Demon Fruit has disappeared. The head of the Don Quixote Family orders his crew to search the island and recover Diez Barrels\u0027 pirate treasure.\nWhile his men desperately search for Corazon, Doflamingo delves into his past and remembers the death of his father, whom he executed before the eyes of his brother, who begged him to stop. He then awakens from his torpor when he hears gunshots and when Pica tells him that they have found Rossinante\u0027s trail, who is now being hunted down like game. The latter, trying to lose his pursuers, manages to hide young Trafalgar Law in a chest full of treasures. But Doflamingo\u0027s younger brother is quickly captured by his former comrades, who intend to pay the price for his betrayal by inflicting the worst possible suffering on him. Suddenly, Doflamingo appears. Knowing he had nothing left to lose, Rossinante pulls a pistol on his brother and confesses that he is a Navy soldier whose mission was to infiltrate the Don Quixote family and stop them in their tracks. From his hiding place, Law overheard his friend\u0027s confession, who also told Doflamingo that he had made his young disciple eat the Ope Ope no Mi so that he would finally be cured of his illness.\nMad with rage, Doflamingo coldly kills his brother by shooting him several times with his pistol before leaving with the rest of his crew, taking all the Diez Barrels chests with them. While Don Quixote\u0027s crew Doflamingo loads the treasure onto the ship, Law emerges from his hiding place and runs as fast as he can away from his former companions. The sound of his footsteps and shouts are camouflaged by Corazon\u0027s power. But Corazon is about to die. Before breathing his last, he declares his love for Law. The death of his mentor plunges Law into a profound sadness that even his cries of pain cannot dispel...",

        "description": "In memory of Corazon, Law continues his battle against Doflamingo, who seems invulnerable to all his attacks. Meanwhile, the exhausted Luffy must contend with both Bellamy and a Doflamingo clone. Just as the Straw Hat wants to strike the latter, Bellamy steps in to attack him. Luffy has to stop fighting to avoid hurting his friend, who is being manipulated by the head of the Donquichotte Family. Above them, Law continues his duel with Doflamingo and tells him that Luffy is a D, and that it is perhaps by the will of fate that he has been sent here, because of Doflamingo\u0027s hatred of the Ds, the sworn enemies of the Gods. Law then reveals to Doflamingo that he\u0027s a D too. And so, angering and provoking him with this confession, Doflamingo loses his temper and causes extensive damage to the roof of the Royal Palace.\nNot far away, Viola, through her Clairvoyance, witnesses these events and tells her father, former King Riku, what she has seen. She tells him that there are three great battlefields spread across Dressrosa and that ten officers of the Donquichotte Family, including Doflamingo, are fighting against their allies. Thanks to her power, the young woman can see all the battles from wherever she is: Franky faces Se\u00f1or Pink in the Smiles Factory, while Zoro confronts Pica on the statue of the decapitated Golem. Meanwhile, Luffy continues his battle against the scythe Doflamingo, who takes great pleasure in using Bellamy as a human shield to prevent the Straw Hat from hitting him. At the same time, on the Field of Flowers, Kyros continues to fight Diamante under the helpless eyes of his daughter Rebecca. The latter shakes the ground, which ripples like a flag, so that his two adversaries can no longer stand.\nOn the lower level, Bartolomeo and Robin fight side by side against Doflamingo\u0027s soldiers, keeping them at bay with their respective powers. However, the young archaeologist is worried about Rebecca, and her companion, who has guessed her fears, lets her go up to Level 4 to help her friend, while he alone keeps Doflamingo\u0027s soldiers at bay. For his part, Cavendish stands up to Gladius and his troops. Meanwhile, on Level 2, Dellinger battles Ideo and dodges his attack, while Hajrudin tries in vain to crush the imposing Machvise. Not far away, Xai fights Baby 5, swearing he\u0027ll pierce his heart, while Don Chinjao battles with Lao G, who hits his opponent with a masterful kick, knocking him to the ground.\nMeanwhile, inside the Royal Palace, Leo and Kabu are on the trail of Princess Mansherry, eliminating all the guards blocking their way. Meanwhile, Zoro continues his sword duel with Pica, while Sabo, using the powers of Mera Mera no Mi, saves the lives of the people of Dressrosa, unaware that her friend Koala is looking for her. On the King\u0027s Plateau, Viola realizes that the fighting will soon be over. She tells her father that if Doflamingo is not defeated, they will all be trapped in the Birdcage forever. Their only hope of escape is to let all those pirates who have allied themselves against Doflamingo fight for them.\nFurious that Law is a D, Doflamingo rises to attack him. Trebol tells him that if he gets angry, he\u0027ll get into his opponent\u0027s game, but it\u0027s too late, Law uses an \u0022Injection Shot\u0022 on him, and drills him through the abdomen. After hitting him, Law tells him he\u0027ll do what Corazon couldn\u0027t do when he hesitated to shoot Doflamingo...",

Baby 5, for her part, believes that Xai wants to marry her, but Don Chinjao, who had turned away from his fight against Lao G, is opposed to the union because Sai is to marry Uhorisia, the daughter of the Nihou Navy chief, as part of a marriage of interests to form the Juppou Navy.\nSuddenly, Lao G makes his spirit leave his body by pretending to die, but immediately recovers when he hears Baby 5 begging him not to leave. The young woman is still convinced that Xai needs her. The latter mockingly tells her: \u0022It\u0027s totally absurd, but so be it! Then die!\u0022. Baby 5, so happy to be of use to someone at last, uses her powers and turns her left forearm into a pistol, which she points directly at his temple. On the verge of death, Baby 5 recalls her past, when her mother abandoned her in the mountains because her family didn\u0027t want to feed an extra mouth and made her believe that useless people like her were not wanted by anyone!\nXai wants to stop Baby 5 from committing the irreparable, but Chinjao attacks the young woman with a headbutt capable of breaking a continent of ice in two! Xai, in a fit of rage, uses a new technique called \u0022Bujaogen\u0022 (military kick) and twists his grandfather\u0027s pointed head before immediately removing the weapon from Baby 5\u0027s temple before she can pull the trigger.\nChinjao collapses to the ground crying, but eventually gets to his feet, tenderly telling his grandson that he has now mastered Hasshoken, their family\u0027s ancestral fighting technique. Lao G, full of energy, takes advantage of this moment of inattention on the part of his opponent to shoot Don Chinjao. This odious act increases Xai\u0027s anger, and after confessing his decision to marry Baby 5 if he beats his opponent, he avenges his beloved grandfather by defeating Lao G using a new fighting technique, the \u0022Kiryu Kirikugi\u0022, while telling him to call him \u0022Don Xai\u0022 from now on...",

        "description": "Zoro has witnessed the defeat of Lao G and is ecstatic at the power of Xai, who has managed to defeat one of the toughest officers in the Doflamingo Family. The latter, in the company of Baby 5, who has become his bride, worries about his grandfather\u0027s state of health, while Baby 5, in love with him, is already ready for the wedding! However, the swordsman of the Straw Hat Crew still has to deal with Pica, who hasn\u0027t said his last word and continues to mock him with his high-pitched voice. The huge golem is still trying to crush him, but Zoro is too quick to fall victim to its attacks. Zoro continues his fierce battle against Pica when King Elizabello II arrives, an old friend of Riku\u0027s, the former ruler of Dressrosa. King Elizabello II offers to help him defeat the huge stone giant, but Zoro politely refuses, while Pica prepares to counterattack.\nOn the Field of Flowers, Kyros is still battling Diamante, who takes great pleasure in tormenting him by reminding him that he had failed to protect the woman he loved. These words infuriate the former captain of Dressrosa\u0027s royal guard, who attacks his adversary with determination. But Kyros can do nothing against Diamante\u0027s extraordinary powers, which have targeted Rebecca. Kyros saves his beloved daughter\u0027s life three times over, while Doflamingo\u0027s right-hand man is determined to see Rebecca die, just as he had done before with Scarlet, the girl\u0027s mother. Faced with this inextricable situation, the former toy soldier swears to atone for his wife\u0027s death and orders Rebecca never to wield a sword again, as he has now become strong enough to protect her.\nAt the same time, in the fire-ravaged lower town, Sabo saves the lives of many Dressrosa citizens when a gladiator asks him to free his comrades who are still trapped in the ruined Coliseum Corrida. Not far away, in the basement of the Royal Palace, Bellamy continues to attack Luffy using the powers of his Demon Fruit. Rushing from wall to wall, he wants to fight the Straw Hat, but the latter refuses to fight because he doesn\u0027t want to see his friend die. However, Bellamy, with tears in his eyes, begs him to face him to restore his lost honor. With Luffy still hesitating, Bellamy has no choice but to attack him, punching him directly in the stomach.\nAbove them, Doflamingo and Trebol attack Law, who has been in agony ever since the master of Dressrosa cut off his right arm. Disregarding his condition, they torture him to their heart\u0027s content, promising him a very slow death. But the former Shichibukai hasn\u0027t lost his determination and continues to taunt Doflamingo, who is annoyed by this spirit of revenge on the part of his former subordinate. Law, with all his energy, attacks him and uses his last remaining strength to bring him down. But Doflamingo is the stronger. Taking advantage of his superiority, Doflamingo promises Law that he will soon join Corazon in death. For his part, Luffy endures Bellamy\u0027s attack without faltering, and once again begs him to stop fighting him. But Doflamingo\u0027s former minion has his way and continues his duel with the Straw Hat, who can\u0027t bring him to his senses. As for Law, he is attacked by Trebol, who is astonished that his victim is still alive. He asks him to give up the game, while Doflamingo advises him to rest, as he doesn\u0027t want to see his enemy already dead.\nNot far away, on the third level, Cavendish and Bartolomeo continue their fight against Gladius and his men, but the two warriors are unable to get along with each other to the point of bickering to the delight of their enemies. Indeed, Bartolomeo, using his powers, has created an impenetrable barrier to protect Robin and the rest of his companions. Cavendish also wants to take advantage of the situation to save his own life, but the die-hard Luffy fan refuses to let him in just as Gladius blows up the floor with his gifts...",

        "description": "The shockwave from the explosion caused by Gladius sweeps away everything in its path. Gladius thinks Cavendish has perished in the blast, but the pirate with the rose has managed to take cover behind Bartolomeo\u0027s protective barrier. The two allies can\u0027t help but bicker, to the point where Cavendish asks his acolyte to raise his shield and let him go to continue his fight against Gladius.\nSuddenly Bartolomeo spots Robin running to help Rebecca on the third level, but she is attacked by Gladius. She is saved in extremis by Bartolomeo, who protects her by extending an invisible barrier over her, which greatly irritates her adversary. Happy to have helped the pretty archaeologist from the Chapeau de Paille crew, who had winked at him in thanks for his services, Bartolomeo begins to mow down all the soldiers of the Donquichotte family, including Cavendish, who is in his camp. Cavendish, enraged, manages to rejoin Gladius, but they must both flee to avoid being crushed by the steamroller created by Bartolomeo, who has become uncontrollable.\nAt the same time, on the second level, Dellinger sees Gladius and Cavendish escaping, but he still has to deal with Ideo who, even if seriously wounded, wants to defeat this insufferable kid. However, the valiant fighter of the Long-Armed tribe is no match for Dellinger, who easily defeats him with his kicks while revealing his true nature: he is a descendant of the Fighting Fish!\nAfter defeating Ideo, Dellinger sets off in search of Gladius and reaches the third level. Before he can help him, the youngest member of the Donquichotte Family is beaten by Hakuba, Cavendish\u0027s diabolical alter ego, without his college having the time to stop him! Gladius, powerless, sees Dellinger collapse in front of him after suffering Hakuba\u0027s dazzling attack. Bartolomeo, well protected behind his barrier, witnesses the carnage and remembers the end of the Battle of Block D, where all the competitors had fainted except Rebecca. Suddenly, he notices that the dreaded attacker of the descendant of the Fighting Fish has now targeted him and realizes that it is Cavendish after recognizing his clothes. The latter, seeing that he could do nothing against Bartolomeo\u0027s barrier, sets his sights on Robin, who is running along the King\u0027s Plateau to join Rebecca.\nQuickly realizing the danger she was in, the young archaeologist immediately stops her assailant by immobilizing him with her powers, much to the relief of Bartolomeo, who thought the young woman\u0027s time had come. The latter, buoyed by her success, asks Cavendish, who has not yet become himself, what he expects of her...",

        "description": "As Robin joins Rebecca in the Field of Flowers, she is targeted by Hakuba. The young archaeologist easily stops her using her powers, before the astonished eyes of Bartolomeo, who witnesses the scene. He is so impressed that he idolizes Robin. For his part, Cavendish struggles to regain full control of his body, but Hakuba resists and orders Cavendish to go back to sleep.\nNot far away, Gladius, to prevent Robin from reaching the 4th level, blows up the wall on which the young archaeologist and Cavendish are standing. Bartolomeo tries to prevent his plan from being carried out, but is wounded in the leg by poisoned needles that turn out to be Gladius\u0027s hair. The latter suddenly begins to swell dangerously in front of his adversary and threatens to do the same to his two friends on the cliff. If Bartolomeo can\u0027t defeat Gladius, he won\u0027t be able to stop him from blowing up the wall where Robin and Cavendish are standing. However, he quickly finds the solution and sacrifices himself by enveloping himself and Gladius\u0027 swollen body in a huge spherical barrier. Stabbing his opponent, he causes the latter to explode. But the power of the blast is stopped by the barrier he has created, preventing Gladius from blowing up the wall on which Robin and Cavendish are standing.\nIn his attempt to stop Gladius, Bartolomeo receives thousands of poisoned needles that paralyze him completely, without releasing his pressure on Gladius, who is still imprisoned in the spherical barrier. But Gladius does not admit defeat. Even with a wounded shoulder and a bald head from all his poison needles, he\u0027s still capable of shattering the wall containing Bartolomeo\u0027s two friends. For his part, Cavendish has had to sacrifice half his body to Hakuba, and both beg Robin to release them in exchange for Hakuba using his speed to take the young archaeologist to the Field of Sunflowers where Rebecca is. Feeling bent, Robin accepts Hakuba and Cavendish\u0027s proposal just as Gladius blows up the cliff without Bartolomeo being able to stop him. The Doflamingo Family officer watches in amazement as his two prey escape before his very eyes.\nAs Cavendish and Robin reach the top of the King\u0027s Plateau, the pirate with the rose suddenly falls asleep and Robin again uses his powers to prevent them both from crashing to the ground. For his part, Bartolomeo blames himself for not having saved Robin and remembers the first time he saw Luffy in Loguetown, when the latter was about to be executed by Baggy on the very spot where Gol D. had died twenty years earlier. Roger had died twenty years earlier. Since that incident, Bartolomeo has developed a boundless passion for the Straw Hats, to the point of copying the fighting techniques of his idol, who had emerged victorious from the Coliseum Corrida arena, defeating one after the other of his opponents. Wanting to make himself worthy of the latter, Bartolomeo rises to his feet and, despite his wounds, finishes Gladius off with a punch imitating Luffy\u0027s \u0022Gomu Gomu no Pistol\u0022.\nOn the Sunflower Field, Diamante continues to wave the ground where Kyros and Rebecca are standing like a flag. He attacks Rebecca by waving the blade of his sword, but is prevented from doing so by Robin, who has decided to protect the young gladiator from him at all costs...",

        "description": "Using his powers, Robin takes on the task of protecting Rebecca instead of Kyros, as the former Coliseum Corrida champion prepares to unleash his wrath on Diamante, who is exasperated at seeing the Straw Hat archaeologist meddling in his affairs. At the same time, on the third level, Bartolomeo notices that two soldiers are carrying Gladius on a stretcher and lets them go after learning that his enemy will be unconscious for several days.\nOn their side, soldiers take Dellinger, who is in a bad way after his encounter with Hakuba, for treatment on the second floor of the Royal Palace, behind the chapel. There, they are greeted by Jora, who orders them to take good care of the Doflamingo Family executives. She suddenly learns from a guard that Gladius has also been defeated. She decides to carry out her plan, while Viola discovers, thanks to her Clairvoyance, where Princess Mansherry has been imprisoned. The youngest daughter of former King Riku then receives a snail call from the Smile Factory, where the fight between Se\u00f1or Pink and Franky continues to rage to the cheers of their respective fans. The dwarves there are worried about Mansherry. Viola rushes to reassure them by trying to contact Leo and Kabu, who are on the trail of the princess. She succeeds and informs the Tontatta army captain that Mansherry is being held by Jora and forced to use her power against her will. Knowing what would happen to their sovereign\u0027s daughter, the two dwarves climb the staircase to the chapel in a flash, beating off the soldiers guarding the entrance with ease.\nAs they make their way to rescue Mansherry, the latter, still captive, must face Jora, who orders her to use her ability to heal Machvise, Sugar, Dellinger and Lao G, who have been defeated. Unfortunately, the young princess is unable to do what she asks, as she cannot heal bad people against her will, and implores Leo to come to her aid. L\u00e9o is on his way, but Kabu has been hit and can no longer follow him. Now alone to deliver the princess, L\u00e9o defeats his enemies one by one to reach Mansherry. Mansherry is mistreated by Jora, who forces her to change her mind by torturing her into obeying him. Soon, a tear escapes from Mansherry\u0027s eyes and she stumbles upon a wounded guard. The latter is intensely healed. Jora then understands that the princess\u0027s power lies in her tears and tries to use them to bring her defeated companions back to life.\nHowever, Mansherry is not as docile as she would like and Jora has to use the hard way to get her to shed tears. Striking her on the fly, the young princess soon lets out a tear, much to the fear of Viola, who warns Leo to rescue Mansherry as quickly as possible. In view of the seriousness of the situation, the beautiful gypsy shares her concern with her father and her companions who are close by. Viola tells Usopp about Mansherry\u0027s power, which is a serious asset for their enemies. Indeed, using his gifts, they can heal defeated Doflamingo family members as many times as they like, making this a never-ending battle!\nEncouraged by the Tontattas, Usopp, Kinemon and Kanjuro, Leo manages to quickly find the place where Mansherry was imprisoned and continues to be mistreated by Jora. But the princess lets out several strings of tears, much to Jora\u0027s delight. Just as the healing tears were about to reach the Doflamingo Family\u0027s defeated cadres, Kabu suddenly appears and jostles Machvise, Sugar, Dellinger and Lao G before they are healed by the tears crashing to the ground. Leo takes advantage of his friend\u0027s maneuver to violently attack Jora and uses the full power of his Demon Fruit to defeat his adversary, sewing her and all her companions together and saving King Gancho\u0027s daughter, who is delighted to be reunited with her family at last, while confessing her love for Leo. Viola witnesses the victory of the captain of the Tontata army and reports it to her friends, who are pleased by this amazing outcome, while at the Royal Palace, Bellamy continues to violently attack Luffy to make him fight him. But the Straw Hat refuses the confrontation, worrying instead about the disastrous state of health of his opponent, who couldn\u0027t care less. Indeed, Bellamy wants to beat Luffy so that Doflamingo will have something to remember him by, which infuriates the Straw Hat...",

        "description": "Despite the rain of stinging iron bullets raining down on him, Kyros fiercely attacks Diamante, who defends herself as best she can under the eyes of Rebecca and Robin, who are still sheltered under the plant umbrella created by the young archaeologist. Determined to avenge his wife\u0027s death, the former Coliseum Corrida champion fights like hell, ignoring the multiple wounds inflicted by the rain of iron pounding his body. Keenly aware of the pain, Kyros continues to fight Diamante, who, despite her fencing skills combined with the powers of her Demon Fruit, soon finds herself in a very bad position.\nAt the same time, on the former King\u0027s Plateau, Viola uses her Clairvoyance to witness the intense battle taking place on the Flower Field and warns her companions that Rebecca is all right, while feeling Kyros\u0027s pain and anger as he fights like a lion. For her part, Diamante is impatient not to see her adversary already dead and continues to fight Kyros, who soon reaches the limit of his strength. The senior officer of the Doflamingo family takes advantage of this moment to deliver the coup de gr\u00e2ce to his opponent. The scene is observed by Viola, who describes everything she sees to her father and friends. After his daughter hears the name of her missing sister, Riku recalls with emotion the moment when he learned of Diamante\u0027s murder of Scarlett. Diamante had bragged to Viola about his deed, when the young girl was working for Don Quixote Doflamingo at the Palais Royal and wanted to take revenge on her sister\u0027s murderer.\nJust as Diamante was about to deliver the coup de gr\u00e2ce to her adversary, Kyros rose to his feet and attacked his wife\u0027s murderer with even more vengeance. The rain of stinging iron bullets had finished falling and, despite his wounds, the legendary hero of the Colis\u00e9e Corrida used the \u0022Trueno Bastardo\u0022, one of his most powerful fighting techniques, to defeat Diamante, who collapsed on Scarlett\u0027s grave in the middle of the Field of Flowers. Exhausted, the former Colis\u00e9e Corrida champion catches his breath. He is soon joined by Rebecca, while Robin, with a smile on her face, falls to the ground, losing a lot of blood after being wounded in the back during the shower of stinging iron bullets!\nWorried about her father\u0027s state of health, which requires urgent attention, Rebecca meditates beside him on her mother\u0027s grave, while Viola, thanks to her powers, learns of Kyros\u0027s victory over Diamante and shares the news with her companions gathered on the former King\u0027s Plateau. However, Viola warns her companions that the game is not yet won, as the four remaining members of the Doflamingo Family - Bellamy, Pica, Trebol and the current ruler of Dressrosa, the infamous Don Quixote Doflamingo - still have to be defeated. For his part, Riku, whose life is no longer in danger, decides to protect the citizens of his kingdom from this threat, while Ussop, deep in conversation with Kinemon and Kanjuro, notices Issho\u0027s disappearance. Issho has gone down to the lower town to find out whether the Navy soldiers have succeeded in restoring order by subduing the out-of-control citizens. When he learns that all was in order, Admiral Fujitora orders his men to gather all civilians in one place and set up a defensive perimeter around them to protect them.\nMeanwhile, Zoro continues his duel with Pica, who is proving to be a tough opponent. Suddenly, the latter abandons the fight to attack Kyros and Rebecca in the Flower Field before Robin\u0027s helpless eyes. Pica sees Diamante\u0027s defeat and laughs at him, while Kyros rises to his feet and once again draws his sword from its scabbard to face an enemy even more powerful than the one he had just defeated, while protecting his beloved daughter, who is frightened by the impressive stone Golem...",

        "description": "In the Palais Royal, Bellamy continues to leap from wall to wall, risking his own life to provoke Luffy. Luffy keeps trying to talk sense into his friend, but to no avail. However, Bellamy doesn\u0027t care about his recommendations and hits the Straw Hat hard. He takes the blows without flinching.\nOutside the palace, on the Field of Flowers, Kyros and Rebecca are threatened by Pica, who has appeared in front of them. Pica asks the former Colis\u00e9e Corrida champion what Riku means to him. Kyros replies that the former king of Dressrosa, who is also his father-in-law, was an irreproachable sovereign who was loved by his subjects before the arrival of Doflamingo, who brought discord to the island. People, even the poor, lived happily under his reign, and it\u0027s to recapture this past happiness that Kyros fights to free Dressrosa from tyranny and return the kingdom to its rightful owner, King Riku. Pica understands the situation and disappears before the stunned eyes of Kyros and Rebecca, who can\u0027t understand why their adversary refuses to confront them. The situation also puzzles Robin.\nThe young archaeologist, who has been following the whole scene, notes with horror that Pica is making her way to the 3rd floor to attack the surviving gladiators of the Colosseum Corrida. Zoro, who has not digested his opponent\u0027s abandonment, follows him to bring him down. Meanwhile, Pica reaches the third level and discovers the betrayal of Baby 5, who has fallen madly in love with Xai. The stone giant decides to punish her by crushing her. But the young woman\u0027s life is saved by Don Chinjao\u0027s grandson, who has pushed his future wife aside to prevent her being killed, but finds himself a prisoner. Don Chinjao tries to help Xai, but is attacked by Pica. Mad with anger, Xai breaks free from his stone prison and decides to fight the Doflamingo Family\u0027s top officer.\nJust as Xai is about to confront him, Zoro, exasperated by Pica\u0027s cowardly attack on the defenseless wounded, intervenes and decides to take up his duel with the Stone Golem where he left off, even if it costs him his own life. Suddenly, Pica revives his former stone body, which the Straw Hat Crew swordsman had decapitated, and uses it to terrorize the people of Dressrosa, as well as the Navy soldiers who can do nothing to stop him. Pica, seizing his advantage, decrees that this kingdom is the exclusive property of Don Quixote Doflamingo, who is the sole and worthy king of Dressrosa.\nWith these words, the colossal statue of Pica moves towards the King\u0027s Plateau to take Riku\u0027s life and then defeat all the enemies on the Plateau, including Usopp and the two samurai from the Land of Wa. For his part, Zoro follows him at a distance, determined to stop him at all costs. Pica provokes panic among the island\u0027s population, who run for cover to avoid being crushed by the imposing stone statue. Marine forces try to stop her by firing cannonballs at her, but the projectiles ricochet off her immense torso. Pica continues to advance towards the Plateau, watched by Kyros, Rebecca, Robin and Bartolomeo, who wants to fight Pica.\nFar behind him, Zoro has all the trouble in the world to catch up with his adversary and devises various plans of attack to put him out of action. His first plan was to make a long-distance cut with his swords, but he quickly abandoned this idea as he noticed that the distance was too great and that his sword strike would lose too much power. The second option open to him was to jump and climb above Pica, but again, this plan was doomed to failure as he couldn\u0027t move through the air over such a long distance. The third idea that crossed his mind was to shout to warn Usopp and the others of the danger threatening them, but his voice wasn\u0027t loud enough for his friend to hear it too. Zoro came up with a fourth plan, which involved calling Usopp with a snail phone and ordering him to leave the Old King\u0027s Plateau as soon as possible. But this too would not work, as he had no communication device. Zoro is left with a fifth and final plan, while Pica prepares to strike the Plateau with his huge stone fist. The pirate hunter rushes to implement it with the help of Elizabello II, who reserves himself for his King Punch, Orombus, Xai, Baby 5 and Don Chinjao, planning to fly through the air and cut the immense Golem\u0027s stone body to pieces before defeating Pica once and for all, whose body made of blood and flesh lies inside the immense stone structure. Implementing his latest plan, Zoro is about to launch his final assault on Pica...",

Meanwhile, Navy soldiers try to stop Pica by firing cannons at him. But this only serves to increase the stone giant\u0027s anger, and he routs his tiny attackers. Riku, fed up with the carnage, orders Pica to stop. In doing so, the former ruler of Dressrosa exposes himself to danger. Knowing he was risking his own life, Riku asks Tank to evacuate everyone from the former King\u0027s Plateau, as he has a score to settle with Pica. Ordering his companions to flee, he stays put. This attitude surprises his former subjects, who decide to stay with him. For his part, Zoro is about to put his plan into action.\nMeanwhile, Pica stretches out his huge stone arm to crush Riku, but has to stop when he notices the citizens of Dressrosa lending a helping hand to their former king by gathering around him. This slight setback doesn\u0027t thwart his plan, and Pica resumes his momentum to annihilate all his enemies. Usopp could only let out a long scream of horror as he saw the enormous hand of stone descend upon him. Suddenly, when all was lost, Orlumbus uses all his power to launch Zoro into the air. The Swordsman of the Straw Hat Crew is propelled through the sky at lightning speed, quickly reaching his target. Using the Weapon Fluid to coat the blades of his sabers to render them unbreakable, Zoro experiments with a new fighting technique that involves cutting the stone body of the immense Golem into pieces in order to extract Pica from inside, before the stunned eyes of all Dressrosa\u0027s inhabitants. When Zoro finally managed to pull his enemy out of his stone gangue, the latter covered his entire body in Haki to prevent the fencer from cutting him. Relying on the power of his own Fluid, the latter remembers his first encounter with Mihawk and vows to surpass him to become the world\u0027s greatest swordsman. Wishing to honor this promise, Zoro manages to strike down his dangerous adversary, but heaps of stone threaten to fall on those still on the plateau. That\u0027s when Elizabello II comes to their rescue, using his King Punch to pulverize what\u0027s left of Pica\u0027s former body to prevent any innocent people from being hurt by the rubble falling from the sky...",

        "description": "After Pica\u0027s defeat, Zoro recalls episodes from his training with Mihawk on the island of Kuraigana, who advised him to coat his sword blades with Fluid to prevent them from breaking. Realizing that his weapons had nothing, he hears Usopp\u0027s cries for him to come urgently to the King\u0027s Plateau. The swordsman of the Chapeau de Paille crew is quick to respond, and easily climbs the huge rampart separating him from his friend. At the same time, in the lower town, near the rubble of the ancient stone giant, naval soldiers gather around Issho to thank him for saving them. Indeed, after Elizaberro II had launched his famous King Punch, the pieces of the immense golem had been pulverized and had narrowly avoided the former King\u0027s Plateau, but were now threatening the inhabitants of the lower town. Admiral Fujitora intervened and, using his telekinetic powers, managed to levitate the huge debris above the city so that civilians and soldiers could evacuate to a safer place without anyone being hurt.\nThe news of Pica\u0027s defeat spreads rapidly throughout Dressrosa, and Xai is astonished that Zoro didn\u0027t take part in the Coliseum Corrida tournament, where he would surely have won without the slightest difficulty. Suddenly, a terrible explosion is heard. It comes from the Smiles Factory, which the Dwarves had managed to blow up by destroying all the SAD stocks in a huge brewery that consumes the entire interior of the enormous building. From the top of the Royal Palace, Trebol witnesses the scene but is not the least bit worried. He\u0027s convinced that Mansherry is still at their service and that she can revive all the Doflamingo Family\u0027s defeated officers. For her part, the Dwarf princess, transported by her faithful Leo and escorted by Kabu, arrives at the Flower Field and meets Kyros, Rebecca and Robin, who are very surprised by this visit. When the leader of the Tontatta army approaches Kyros, he can\u0027t help but draw a comparison with the enormous statue of the legendary hero at the Colosseum Corrida, which resembles him exactly. But Leo is delighted to see his commander-in-chief back in human form. Suddenly Mansherry sees that Kyros is seriously injured and rushes to treat him using his powers. But Rebecca\u0027s father refuses to let the Dwarf princess use her gifts, and asks her to heal all the islanders who are more in need of care than he is.\nAstonished by this decision, Princess Mansherry sees the extent of the disaster ravaging Dressrosa and understands the situation. At the insistence of Kyros, who believes that the island\u0027s destiny lies in the hands of valiant, justice-loving pirates, Leo, Kabu, Mansherry, Robin, Rebecca and himself cast their eyes in the direction of the Royal Palace, where the final battle between Luffy and Law and the infamous Doflamingo is being played out.\nAt the same time, inside the Palais Royal, as an unknown enemy neutralizes the guards, Koala tries to contact Sabo by snail phone to ask for his help, but the latter is too busy helping prisoners escape from the ruins of the Colis\u00e9e Corrida. But when his friend tells him that Luffy could be hurt, the Revolutionary Army\u0027s No.2 changes his mind and decides to join her.\nAt the same time, Zoro arrives at the top of the old King\u0027s Plateau to the applause of the people of Dressrosa, who thank him for having brought down such a fierce enemy. As for Ussop, he can\u0027t help weeping with joy at seeing his friend safe and sound. But Zoro quickly brings them to their senses, pointing out that the Birdcage encircling the island had not yet fallen. This meant that Doflamingo still had to be defeated for joy to return to Dressrosa. Riku and his daughter Viola agreed with him, and kept a close eye on the Royal Palace, where the battle between Bellamy and Luffy was not yet over.\nThe former captain of the New Age Crew continues to give the Straw Hat a hard time, still believing that his friend had been fooled by the master of Dressrosa and was going to die for nothing. Seeing that Luffy stubbornly refused to fight, Bellamy decided to kill him. Launching himself at him at full speed, he was struck down by a violent punch impregnated with Fluid that pinned him to the spot. Exhausted, Luffy gets to his feet after reluctantly defeating his friend and shouts Doflamingo\u0027s name, determined to make him pay the ultimate price. Doflamingo hears him and, in the company of Trebol, waits with bated breath beside Law\u0027s lifeless body...",

        "description": "On the King\u0027s Plateau, Viola announces to everyone that Luffy has defeated Bellamy and that only two formidable foes remain, namely Trebol and Doflamingo, and coldly tells them that they have just lost one of their own. This was Trafalgar Law, whose lifeless body lay on the ground under Doflamingo\u0027s lustful gaze, eager to see how Luffy would react to the loss of such a dear ally.\nA few minutes before this incident, Doflamingo was in the Royal Palace with Trebol, fighting against Trafalgar Law, already in bad shape after the loss of his arm. The fight was unequal and soon the former disciple of Corazon found himself at the mercy of his two attackers. Before giving him the final blow, Doflamingo asks his victim to practice his immortality technique on him, so that the master of Dressrosa can enjoy eternal youth in exchange for granting him any wish. Law accepts his proposal and asks Doflamingo to bring Corazon back to life. Trebol and Doflamingo are astonished by this wish. Law takes advantage of this moment to mock the ruler of Dressrosa, telling him that he can never defeat the Straw Hat Crew and take back Caesar Clown, who is their prisoner. These remarks provoke Doflamingo\u0027s anger, and he shoots Law repeatedly at point-blank range until his magazine is empty.\nBack to the present: Viola has told her companions of Trafalgar Law\u0027s death, and all remain silent in the face of this terrible news. After listening to his daughter, Riku decides to descend into the lower town to save as many people as possible from certain death, and is soon followed by many citizens, all too happy to serve their former sovereign once again. Meanwhile, Doflamingo watches Law bleed to death and struggles to calm his anger. Trebol manages to cheer him up, and Doflamingo relishes the idea of soon getting the Ope Ope no Mi back. As he prepares to reduce the perimeter of the \u0022Birdcage\u0022 enveloping the island, Luffy appears, determined to settle the score. Doflamingo looks at him and tells him he\u0027s too late to save his friend, having learned that Luffy has defeated Bellamy, who refused to flee. Mad with rage, the Straw Hat uses his \u0022Elephant Gun\u0022 to hit his enemy, but the latter stops his attack by using his powers. Undaunted, Luffy begins a duel to the death with Doflamingo, using his most powerful fighting techniques. Suddenly, he notices Law lying bleeding on the ground. He tries to revive him, but to no avail. He realizes that his friend is dead, a situation that satisfies Doflamingo, who continues to taunt the Straw Hat. Exasperated by his taunts, the Straw Hat counterattacks, even using Bellamy\u0027s technique to strike down Doflamingo and Trebol. But the master of Dressrosa stops his attacks again with a wave of his hand.\nFor his part, Riku arrives at the foot of the Old King\u0027s Plateau and watches carefully as his companions join him. Along with the navy soldiers and panicked citizens, he suddenly noticed the \u0022Birdcage\u0022 enveloping Dressrosa beginning to shrink dangerously, destroying everything in its path. Just as everything was about to be over, Law, whom everyone thought dead, regains consciousness to confide his last words to Luffy...",

Navy soldiers are powerless to stop the carnage. Meanwhile, in the Royal Palace, Doflamingo taunts Luffy\u0027s inability to save everyone and says his diabolical trap will kill everyone on the island in an hour. For their part, the Navy forces try to help the weakest escape from the danger zones to the city center. Panic even grips Usopp, who has taken refuge on the King\u0027s Plateau with Zoro, Kinemon, Kanjuro and Viola, as well as the rest of the island.\nSeeing that the only way to stop this infernal machine is to kill Doflamingo, Luffy rushes in to strike him, and another fierce battle ensues. As the Straw Hat desperately rushes into battle, his attack is anticipated by Law, who everyone thought was dead. Stunned by such a turn of events, Doflamingo and Trebol are too slow to react, and Law\u0027s attack tears the internal organs of the ruler of Dressrosa. The Straw Hat\u0027s former ally reveals that he had prepared a huge operating room around the palace using his power, and that it was thanks to this that he managed to escape the bullets that Doflamingo had fired at him by swapping his body with another nearby.\nIn the meantime, Doflamingo was now at the mercy of Trafalgar Law and Luffy, who was beating the crap out of him. Just as Luffy is about to give him the final blow, Law tells his friend to stop, dragging himself along the ground, and takes advantage of the situation, after reminiscing about his past, to tell him that Doflamingo should have died instead of Corazon...",

But he is stopped in his tracks by Luffy, who wants his friend to avenge the memory of his former master. The latter hadn\u0027t forgotten that Corazon had been murdered by his own brother while trying to stop him. Doflamingo, who knew how to strike a chord with his opponent, criticized his dead brother, calling him incompetent and right to have eliminated him. This was too much for Law, who launched a final attack that electrified Doflamingo\u0027s entire body, inflicting great pain.\nHaving delivered this final blow before Trebol\u0027s helpless eyes, Trafalgar Law collapsed from exhaustion at his enemy\u0027s feet. Luffy runs to him, begging him not to die and to stay with him. But, to their great misfortune, Doflamingo survives his attack by using his powers to repair his punctured organs with ropes. Luffy tries to intervene, but is overpowered by Trebol, who traps him with his mucus and sends him to the other end of the Palais Royal terrace. Once the Chapeau de Paille was out of harm\u0027s way, the head of the Doflamingo Family rose above his unfortunate adversary and aimed at Law\u0027s head to strike him with his right foot, but his gesture was stopped in extremis by Luffy, who hadn\u0027t said his last word. Luffy then gave his enemy a look full of hatred, letting him know that a merciless battle was about to begin between them.\nLuffy and Doflamingo fight each other using the Haki of Kings, but the power of the two adversaries, perceptible throughout Dressrosa, is equal. Trebol follows their confrontation with his eyes, remembering with nostalgia how he and Vergo had encouraged young Doflamingo to become King of the Pirates and to eliminate all those who would dare oppose him, after learning how the young boy had escaped popular vindictiveness by using the Haki of Kings for the first time in his life. As a token of his appreciation, Trebol gave him a pistol and a rather special Demon Fruit that would give him power and might: the Ito Ito no Mi. As for the pistol, Doflamingo used it to kill his father, who had stripped him and his brother Rosinante of their Celestial Dragon dignity.\nThe fact that Doflamingo is the King appointed by the heavens fills Luffy with anger, and he fights his opponent with all his might. The power of his attacks is so great that soon the Straw Hat has the upper hand over Doflamingo. But Doflamingo regains the upper hand, relying on his demonic charisma to temporarily knock Luffy down...",

Knowing that Luffy could no longer move, Trebol invites his boss to settle Trafalgar Law\u0027s account once and for all. Doflamingo doesn\u0027t hesitate, and heads for his unfortunate adversary to deliver the final blow. Luffy was not happy about the situation, and struggled like hell to get out of Trebol\u0027s grasp. Seeing that he had no chance of getting away, Law provoked Trebol by calling him papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9. This insulting remark sets him off. Offended, Trebol pushes Dofflamingo aside and threatens to kill Law, unaware that he was playing into his enemy\u0027s hands.\nTaking advantage of this moment, Trebol recalls the time when young Doflamingo had used the Haki of Kings to make all his family\u0027s enemies faint. With this act, Trebol, Pica, Diamante and Vergo designated him as the chosen one of the gods, and they immediately rallied to his cause. After Doflamingo had taken the head of his murdered father back to Marie-Joie, he returned to his new family, who welcomed him with open arms and designated him their rightful leader. After this episode, the Doflamingo family\u0027s influence grew, to the detriment of other organizations that overshadowed them. Eliminating them one by one, Doflamingo and his men acquired an unprecedented aura that threatened the future of the world while causing chaos and desolation wherever they went. As time went by, the Doflamingo family commanded respect, and no one dared contradict them on pain of losing their lives. Trebol, who knew his leader\u0027s powers, constantly reminded him to behave like a king, and that one day he would become the new King of the Pirates.\nBack to the present: Law is at the mercy of Trebol, who threatens to set fire to his flammable mucus. Knowing he had nothing left to lose, Trafalgar Law confesses to Trebol that Doflamingo couldn\u0027t care less about his deputies - they\u0027re nothing to him, not even members of his own family, but mere puppets. This new remark increases Trebol\u0027s anger and, despite Doflamingo\u0027s warning, he finds himself trapped by Law. As he threatens to kill him with his stick, despite Luffy\u0027s protests that he is still trapped in his mucus, Law uses his powers to attack Trebol, using his arm that Doflamingo had cut off. With disconcerting ease, Trafalgar Law\u0027s sword slices through Trebol\u0027s torso, causing him to scream in terror. These screams are heard throughout Dressrosa, including in the Field of Flowers, where Kyros and his companions remain.\nMeanwhile, the dwarves who had freed their brothers from the Smile Factory are worried about the turn of events. For his part, Franky invites his friends to stray from the confines of the \u0022Birdcage\u0022, which threatens to slice them to pieces if they don\u0027t leave. At the same time, Luffy manages to extricate himself from Trebol\u0027s mucus and notices that Law\u0027s sword stroke had removed all the mucus covering his opponent\u0027s body. Exposed, he looks sad to see, but he hasn\u0027t said his last word. Lighting a lighter above Law, Trebol set fire to the mucus still on his body, causing a huge explosion that engulfed the Royal Palace and shook the rest of the island.\nUsing her Clairvoyance, Viola informs her friends that Trebol has just been defeated and discovers that Luffy and Doflamingo had managed to escape the explosion at the Palais Royal. Law\u0027s life is also saved, as he was carried away from the deadly blast by the Straw Hat. The latter entrusts his ailing friend to Robin, who had caught him using her gifts and noticed that Law\u0027s right arm had been severed. As she tries to come to his aid, Doflamingo approaches her, informing her that his enemy is still alive and that he is about to deliver the coup de gr\u00e2ce. Luffy tries to intervene, but he\u0027s not quick enough to stop Doflamingo\u0027s projectiles, which threaten to injure Robin and Law...",

        "description": "After Robin recovers Trafalgar Law, she is attacked by Doflamingo, who has come to finish off her enemy. But his projectiles are stopped in extremis by Cavendish\u0027s fencing skills. Cavendish looks for Luffy, but he\u0027s too busy fighting Doflamingo, who\u0027s dying to take him on at the top of the burning Royal Palace. The Straw Hat orders Cavendish to take everyone and get off the plateau. The pirate with the rose reluctantly obeys, while Kyros, Rebecca, Leo and Princess Mansherry worry about Law\u0027s injury.\nNot far away, Bartolomeo contemplates the immense stone body of Pica sliced by Zoro. He marvels at the feat, forgetting for a moment the dangers that lie ahead. Suddenly, he is called by Cavendish, who asks him to use his power to create stairs so that Robin and his friends can escape from the plateau. At the mention of the name of the beautiful archaeologist from the Crew of the Straw Hat, Bartolomeo is quick to comply.\nAt the same time, in the lower town, the \u0022Birdcage\u0022 continues to retract, threatening the lives of all Dressrosa\u0027s inhabitants. The latter flee at full speed towards the town center, abandoning their homes which are destroyed by Doflamingo\u0027s diabolical trap. Doflamingo is ready for the final confrontation. He glares at Luffy, telling him he can\u0027t wait to finish Law off. The Straw Hat retorts that he won\u0027t give him the pleasure. Knowing he could never bend him with words, Doflamingo attacks Luffy first. A fierce battle in the Palais Royal begins. Against all the odds, Doflamingo proves to be a tough opponent, and all Luffy\u0027s fighting techniques are no match for him. Their duel is so fierce that it cracks the ramparts of the Royal Palace, which collapses before Robin\u0027s horrified eyes. For his part, Cavendish carries Law in his arms as he flees the set, but the Shichibukai asks him to leave him behind. Cavendish doesn\u0027t understand Trafalgar Law\u0027s attitude. Trafalgar Law explains that he had to wait almost 13 years for his revenge, and now the fate of Dressrosa rests entirely on Luffy\u0027s shoulders. He hopes his friend will emerge victorious from his battle with Doflamingo, and it\u0027s for this reason that he asks Cavendish to leave him there. He wants to witness the Straw Hat\u0027s triumph.\nThe battle between Luffy and Doflamingo is intense. The two pirates are of equal strength, and neither knows who will triumph over the other. Not far away, Trafalgar Law continues to plead with Cavendish to leave him behind. Knowing he\u0027d never be able to change his mind, Cavendish complied, inviting Robin to go ahead while he stayed with Law throughout Luffy\u0027s fight. At the bottom of the plateau, Bartolomeo creates stairs with his gifts and asks Robin to join him as soon as possible. But Robin is reluctant to abandon her companions. She finally leaves after Cavendish covers her shoulders with his coat. The young woman is about to descend the stairs to join Rebecca and Kyros, who are already downstairs, when she stops in front of Kabu, Leo and Mansherry, who don\u0027t want to leave Law to his fate if he\u0027s injured. Robin accepts their decision.\nMeanwhile, on the former King\u0027s Plateau, Zoro and his companions contemplate the progress of the \u0022Birdcage\u0022, which threatens to destroy everything on Dressrosa. This situation greatly displeases Usopp, who can\u0027t help but panic. For his part, Zoro decides to act and asks his friends to follow him. Kanjuro thinks that the Straw Hat Crew swordsman has an ulterior motive and invites Kinemon to accompany him. At the same time, Luffy continues his duel with Doflamingo with just as much zeal. Using Gear Second and Gear Third in succession to defeat his adversary, Luffy fails to bring him down. Worse still, the Straw Hat dropped his guard and Doflamingo took advantage to knock him down. Now at his mercy, the King of Dressrosa predicts that within the hour his \u0022Birdcage\u0022 will be completely sealed off, condemning all the island\u0027s inhabitants to certain death. Doflamingo also takes advantage of this moment to enumerate all the havoc his diabolical trap could well cause. For his part, Luffy has not lost his pride. He gets angry and, while promising to rid Dressrosa of such a monster, ends up activating the Gear Fourth...",

Navy soldiers lend a hand to ensure that no inhabitant is left behind. At the same time, on the King\u0027s Plateau, on the former site of the Royal Palace, the former participants in the Colis\u00e9e Corrida and Baby 5 watch helplessly as the terrifying spectacle unfolds. However, Xai doesn\u0027t want to stand idly by and decides to take matters into his own hands, asking his companions to revive their fallen comrades who had fallen fighting the various officers of the Doflamingo Family. This attitude makes his grandfather proud, as well as his future wife\u0027s boundless admiration. Meanwhile, Viola and Hack descend from the King\u0027s Plateau via the ladder Kanjuro had designed. The young woman is anxious to find her father, who is already down below. Fishman carries Usopp on his shoulders, as the latter is in no condition to stand. Suddenly, Viola notices that the center of the \u0022Birdcage\u0022 is moving (not a good sign).\nAt the same time, in the lower town, as the inhabitants flee at full speed, Zoro remains unperturbed despite the chaotic situation around him and reveals, with Kanjuro and Kinemon accompanying him, that he intends to take a shortcut through the \u0022Birdcage\u0022 which still encircles the island. Meanwhile, Cavendish remains at the bedside of Trafalgar Law, who lies in the Field of Sunflowers. He still wishes to witness Luffy\u0027s triumph over Doflamingo. While awaiting the final assault, the pirate with the rose is pleasantly surprised to discover that there are dwarves on Dressrosa, and that their princess possesses extraordinary healing powers. Indeed, after Leo has mended Law\u0027s torn arm, Mansherry rushes in to administer first aid, dulling the pain with her power. Cavendish recalls his time in the Underground Port, where he had noticed a large quantity of weapons amassed, and realizes that even if they beat Doflamingo, the war would not be over just yet.\nNot far away, at the top of the Royal Palace, Luffy activated the Gear Fourth, swelling his entire body before continuing his duel with Doflamingo. Doflamingo, initially impressed by this new fighting technique, is quickly overwhelmed by his opponent, who sends him violently out of the Palace and into the lower town, to the astonishment of all the inhabitants. Viola and her companions also witness this prodigy. However, the Shichibukai has not said his last word. He begins an aerial duel, attacking Luffy once again, but is unable to dodge the Straw Hat\u0027s lightning punches as he uses the full power of his Gear Fourth to strike down his foe...",

He tells her that when this latest threat disappears, so will the \u0022Birdcage\u0022 that encircles their island. Meanwhile, Zoro wanders the city streets, seemingly lost. He is caught by the two samurai from the Land of Wa, who have joined him by flying on the back of the bird drawn by Kanjuro. He and Kinemon invite him to come with them to quickly reach Franky\u0027s whereabouts.\nAs the three of them fly over Dressrosa\u0027s capital, the Birdcage continues to shrink, threatening the lives of its inhabitants. At the same time, Franky arrives in sight of the Smiles Factory and orders the Tontattas still trapped inside to leave immediately. The dwarves are astonished to see that the factory has not been sliced up like the other buildings. The cyborg understands the situation and explains that the walls of the Smile Factory are made of Sea Granite, a material invulnerable to Doflamingo\u0027s powers. Suddenly, Zoro joins Franky, who informs him that he intends to stop the wires to buy time for Luffy to emerge victorious from his battle with the island\u0027s master.\nDowntown, the duel between the Straw Hat and Doflamingo is far from over. The latter, having recovered from Luffy\u0027s powerful attack, changes his plan by switching his Demon Fruit to awakening mode! This action turns Dressrosa\u0027s buildings into wires, much to Luffy\u0027s astonishment.

Suddenly, Luffy is trapped, but his rage at Doflamingo is unstoppable and he frees himself from his bonds with ease. But the current ruler of Dressrosa has not said his last word. Preventing his adversary from approaching him, he launches new attacks with the Ito Ito no Mi with the aim of tiring out Luffy by turning the whole town into sons.

The head of the Doflamingo Family spots Luffy in the lower town, a shadow of his former self after the effects of the Gear Fourth have worn off. He smiles at the sight before placing his hand on his belly to use his power to heal his internal organs, which have been badly damaged by the Straw Hat\u0027s latest attack. The latter is desperately trying to regain his original form, but his strength is failing him.\nAs the island\u0027s entire population flees, Luffy is left to die a certain death. Then Gats appears, who had previously tried to capture the Straw Hat with the help of former gladiators from the Coliseum Corrida. He promises to protect him. The Straw Hat thanks him for his concern and declares that he needs only ten minutes to recover his Haki and reactivate the Gear Fourth to definitively slaughter Doflamingo in a single blow. Gats accepts his decision on condition that Luffy succeeds in removing the \u0022Birdcage\u0022 that still threatens to destroy Dressrosa. He promises to do so. Roused by this news, Gats puts Luffy on his shoulders to take him to safety with half the gladiators he had with him, while the other half takes charge of holding Doflamingo for as long as it takes for the young pirate to recover all his strength.\nAs the Coliseum Corrida gladiators attack Doflamingo, Jesus Burgess emerges from the shadows, dagger in hand, and pounces on Luffy with the aim of killing him and taking over his Gomu Gomu no Mi! But Sabo steps in and saves Luffy from certain death with a powerful kick that sends Burgess tumbling to the ground. After Sabo has managed to take down Jesus Burgess, he reveals his true identity to Gats and the former Colis\u00e9e Corrida competitors, declaring that Luffy is under his protection as his little brother. At the same time, he explains his relationship with Luffy and Ace. He also explains that Ace\u0027s death was the path he had chosen, and that he had no desire for revenge. The only thing he wants to do now is cover Luffy\u0027s back. He then shows him that he owns the Mera Mera no Mi, a detail that infuriates Burgess. Sabo asks Gats to take Luffy to safety, explaining that he was the rightful heir to Ace\u0027s powers and that no one else but him could get hold of the Mera Mera no Mi.\nAs Gats and the other gladiators continue on their way, carrying Luffy with them, Jesus Burgess violently attacks Sabo to steal his power, but the latter seems invulnerable thanks to his Demon Fruit. The second-in-command of the Revolutionary Army uses his gifts to fight his adversary so that he can no longer take Luffy\u0027s life. The latter, still carried on Gats\u0027 shoulders, explains that it was Sabo who had replaced him during the finals at the Colis\u00e9e Corrida and won the tournament prize in his place. Although this is against the rules, Gats is delighted to learn that Sabo has managed to recover his missing brother\u0027s power. Suddenly, the official commentator of the Coliseum Corrida sees the army of gladiators he had sent against Doflamingo being decimated by the latter in the distance. The survivors are no match for the Shichibukai, who demands Luffy\u0027s head to finish him off once and for all...",

        "description": "In the streets of Dressrosa\u0027s capital, panic-stricken islanders try to save their lives by reaching the center of the island, where the King\u0027s Plateau is located, under the helpless eyes of former sovereign Riku. For their part, the former gladiators of the Colis\u00e9e Corrida are at the bedside of their fallen comrades, having defeated the various officers of the Doflamingo family, such as Hajrudin. The proud warrior of Elbaf is no longer a shadow of his former self, but suddenly a miracle occurs: flakes of light fall from the sky and revive the giant before the astonished eyes of his companions.\nAt the same time, Zoro arrives near the edge of the \u0022Birdcage\u0022 and uses his protective Haki to cover the blades of his swords, using them to slow the advance of Doflamingo\u0027s diabolical trap. Behind him, Kanjuro and Kinemon observe the scene. The Swordsman of the Straw Hat Crew calls for their help, as he will not be able to stop the \u0022Birdcage\u0022 on his own. After a brief moment\u0027s hesitation, the two samurai lend Zoro a hand, imitating him by enveloping their weapons in Fluid, as do Franky and the Tontattas, who join forces by moving the Smile Factory, whose walls are made of Sea Granite, to slow down the shrinking Birdcage.\nNot far away, on the King\u0027s Plateau, on the site of the Royal Palace, Robin, accompanied by Bartolomeo, communicates by snail phone with Viola, who tells her that Zoro and Franky are trying to slow down the \u0022Birdcage\u0022 with the strength of their arms alone. The king\u0027s daughter doubts the success of this venture, but the young archaeologist believes her friends will succeed. At the same time, on the southern side of the King\u0027s Plateau, the people of Dressrosa are revolting against the last remaining soldiers in Doflamingo\u0027s pay. They are shooting at defenseless civilians without the slightest scruple, under the pretext that this, the safest place on the island, is reserved exclusively for officers of the Doflamingo family. Suddenly, Bartolomeo, Kyros and their companions intervene and neutralize the last of Doflamingo\u0027s allies, so that the people of Dressrosa can survive by scaling the New King\u0027s Plateau, which has become the new center of the \u0022Birdcage\u0022.\nIn the center of town, Doflamingo, tired of chasing Luffy, decides to make the Straw Hat come to him by accelerating the narrowing of the \u0022Birdcage\u0022, causing general panic throughout Dressrosa. For his part, Sabo continues his battle against Jesus Burgess, who is determined to kill him in order to appropriate his power. But the commander of the first fleet of Blackbeard\u0027s fleet is no match for the second-in-command of the Revolutionary Army, who takes him down with ease. Suddenly, Sabo notices that the \u0022Birdcage\u0022 is shrinking rapidly, as is Viola, who is horrified to see the impending destruction of her kingdom.\nAt the far end of the \u0022Birdcage\u0022, Zoro, Kinemon and Kanjuro try to halt its advance with their swords, but to no avail. Meanwhile, on the Field of Flowers, Trafalgar Law lies on the ground, his arm cut off by Doflamingo now sewn to the rest of his body. He watches in horror as the compression of the \u0022Birdcage\u0022 accelerates, while Franky and the Dwarves do their utmost to stop the advance of the \u0022Birdcage\u0022 by pushing the walls of the Smile Factory, made of Sea Granite, with all their might. But nothing worked. The citizens of Dressrosa have only three minutes to live, while Luffy still needs four minutes to become himself again!\nSeeing that the only way to save Dressrosa from total annihilation is to gain time, the former gladiators of the Coliseum Corrida attack Doflamingo again, but he manages to beat them easily using his powers. For their part, the other gladiators who had fought against the officers of the Doflamingo Family, together with Leo, Kyros and Robin, try to stop the \u0022Birdcage\u0022 with the help of a Bartolomeo barrier. Leo explains to the young archaeologist how Hajrudin and the others could be healed so quickly. It\u0027s thanks to the healing powers of Princess Mansherry, who temporarily cured all the inhabitants of Dressrosa, including the gladiators, using Chiyupopo lint similar to that of dandelions. But this treatment is short-lived, and those treated by the Dwarf princess will return to their previous state within minutes! So it\u0027s a matter of life and death for everyone in Dressrosa. Meanwhile, Gats, worried that Luffy won\u0027t recover in time, meets Law and entrusts him with the Straw Hat, while the Birdcage continues to shrink inexorably...",

At the same time, Princess Mansherry\u0027s Chiyupopo plush toys are at work, instantly healing injured people by simple touch, but only for a short time. Meanwhile, with Hack carrying him on his back, Ussop tries to convince the able-bodied citizens to go and help his friends stop the Birdcage.\nNot far away, Doflamingo has finished with the former Coliseum Corrida gladiators who dared to challenge him, and orders Luffy to come out of hiding to confront him. This scene, glimpsed thanks to her Clairvoyance, terrifies Viola to the point of wanting to assassinate the master of Dressrosa. For her part, Rebecca orders the islanders to head for the Royal Palace on the plateau, which is still the safest place on Dressrosa, having received the order from her father, who was far too busy pushing the \u0022Birdcage\u0022 with all his might, along with Zoro and all their allies. Suddenly, a crazy idea crossed Rebecca\u0027s mind and she grabbed a sword, determined to fight Doflamingo. But she\u0027s beaten to the punch by her aunt, who had the same idea. Viola orders her niece to turn back, as she doesn\u0027t want Rebecca\u0027s death on her conscience. With that, she pulls a dagger from her hair, which she immediately uses to stab Doflomaingo. But Doflomaingo doesn\u0027t give in and, despite all her skill and flexibility, she can\u0027t touch him. Soon she finds herself at Doflamingo\u0027s mercy, and Rebecca can do nothing about it.\nNot far away, Franky and the Dwarves are still pushing the Smile Factory with their bare hands to halt the advance of the Birdcage, while Zoro, Kanjuro and Kinemon, who are still pushing, receive providential help from Admiral Fujitora and his Haki-savvy men to slow down the Birdcage. The rest of the Navy troops lend a hand, pushing through Bartolomeo\u0027s barrier and helping Franky and the Dwarves on the outskirts of the Smiles Factory. They are soon joined by civilians determined to save their country at all costs, and thanks to their combined efforts, they all manage to stop the Birdcage. But this is only a short respite, as Doflamingo\u0027s diabolical trap is set in motion again, much to everyone\u0027s disappointment! However, all this does not dampen their spirits, and they all start pushing again to save Dressrosa from destruction.\nWanting to gain more time, Viola attacks Doflamingo head-on, but he intercepts her blows. Mad with rage, the daughter of former King Riku tries again to drive her dagger into her opponent\u0027s neck, but Doflamingo does his best not to be hurt and soon stops Viola\u0027s arm, squeezing it with all his might before bringing her down. Viola tries to attack him again, but she\u0027s no match for him. Doflamingo soon uses his powers to manipulate Viola and Rebecca like puppets, forcing Kyros\u0027s daughter to use her sword to kill her aunt.\nNot far away, at the Smiles Factory, the \u0022Birdcage\u0022 continues to compress and attacks the flanks of the King\u0027s Plateau, much to the fear of Dressrosa\u0027s inhabitants. The situation is grave, and there\u0027s only a minute left before Luffy has to come to his senses...",

Some of them, like Gats, climb the walls of the King\u0027s Plateau to save their lives, while Zoro, along with Kinemon, Kanjuro, Issho and the Navy troops, work hard to slow the advance of Doflamingo\u0027s diabolical trap. The same efforts are made at the Smile Factory, where the Dwarves, with Franky\u0027s encouragement, try to stop the Birdcage once again. The same scene is repeated with the former gladiators of the Coliseum Corrida, who join forces to try and stop the Birdcage. Above them, Princess Mansherry continues to rain down Chiyupopo fluff to temporarily heal citizens injured by simple contact, while Gats, accompanied by her two collaborators, reaches a small escarpment overlooking the whole of Dressrosa.\nAt the same time, Viola and Rebecca are still in the grip of the island\u0027s master. Doflamingo uses his powers to force Kyros\u0027s daughter to burnish her sword to kill her aunt. The latter, captive, begs her niece to fight to the bitter end, but to no avail. Rebecca, manipulated like a puppet, moves inexorably towards Viola to strike her with her sword.\nFor his part, Gats speaks to the islanders by snail phone, explaining that Lucy, the young hero who had made his name at the Coliseum Corrida, much to the dismay of Cavendish, who was hoping for his 15 minutes of fame at the time, was none other than Luffy, come to defeat Doflamingo and free Dressrosa from his tyranny. Gats promises that the Straw Hat will defeat the pirate leader in a single blow. This announcement lifts the spirits of all the island\u0027s inhabitants, including the former participants in the Colis\u00e9e Corrida tournament who had not given up hope of seeing Doflamingo fall one day. To the cheers of the people of Dressrosa, Gats also announces, over the loudspeakers, that it\u0027s almost time for Doflamingo\u0027s execution. However, the effects of Mansherry\u0027s Chiyupopo lint lose their power and soon Hajrudin and the other gladiators cared for by the Dwarf princess lose consciousness! But Kabu, who is carrying her on his back, comforts her as best he can, telling her that she has brought a miracle to Dressrosa, saving the lives of many of the wounded inhabitants. Thanks to this prodigy, everyone was able to buy time for Luffy\u0027s speedy recovery. On this subject, Gats once again cheers Lucy\u0027s name, a situation that exasperates Doflamingo. The annoyed Doflamingo silences Gats by impaling him, then prepares to finish off the fight between Rebecca and Viola with a fatal blow to the latter.\nBefore this can happen, Trafalgar Law, who has been watching over the Straw Hat until he fully recovers, teleports Luffy to the scene of the fight and takes Viola\u0027s place, automatically joining the corsair. With this action, the Straw Hat manages to save the young woman\u0027s life and break the blade of Rebecca\u0027s sword with his Haki-covered forehead. Having finally recovered all his strength, Luffy prepares to end his duel with Doflamingo to the cheers of the people of Dressrosa, who continue to cheer his name...",

        "description": "Luffy manages to stop Rebecca\u0027s sword strike by swapping places with Viola thanks to Law\u0027s powers. The Straw Hat is ready for the final battle, much to the relief of Gats, who warns the people of Dressrosa of their hero\u0027s return. This situation displeases Doflamingo, who wants to settle the score once and for all. However, cheered on by all the island\u0027s citizens, Luffy proudly stands up to his enemy, who had noticed that the young pirate had only managed to recover his Haki, but that he could hardly stand on his legs.\nDoflamingo takes advantage of the situation to attack Luffy before Rebecca\u0027s helpless eyes. Rebecca soon becomes the Dressrosa master\u0027s new target, but is saved in extremis by Law, who teleports her to him after swapping places with a rock that is instantly pulverized by Doflamingo\u0027s attack. Doflamingo, annoyed at seeing his victim lose, understands what\u0027s going on when he spots Trafalgar Law at the top of the Royal Palace wall. He tells him that he will witness the Straw Hat\u0027s defeat at first hand and, with that, Doflamingo launches a new attack on Luffy, changing the location of their duel into a son.\nThe Straw Hat finds himself completely immobilized, at the mercy of his adversary. The latter sends him thousands of sharp threads to perforate the armor of his Haki, which Luffy finally succumbs to before the panic-stricken eyes of Gats and all the inhabitants of Dressrosa. Doflamingo continued to torment Luffy until he died, finally sending him crashing into a wall of the King\u0027s Plateau. Seeing his adversary seriously wounded, Doflamingo inflicts the final blow with another salvo of sharp wires, all of which hit their target. Witnessing the scene, Gats can\u0027t believe that Luffy managed to escape such an attack alive, yet the Straw Hat is still with us. He is even under the influence of Doflamingo, who uses his demonic powers to manipulate him like a puppet. The master of Dressrosa relishes the moment. As Luffy strides towards his enemy, he recalls Rayleigh\u0027s sage advice about the \u0022Kong Gun\u0022 when he was on Rusukaina Island. Luffy had noticed that this formidable attack had no effect on Doflamingo. Doflamingo continued to provoke him, claiming that it was only natural for him, holder of a very special Demon Fruit, to subjugate all his subjects to his will, who for him were nothing more than common humans to be manipulated for the rest of their lives. This revelation exasperates Luffy, who tries with all his might to rebel against Doflamingo.\nMeanwhile, the Birdcage continues its advance, ravaging all that remains of Dressrosa. The King\u0027s Plateau is half-destroyed, and the former gladiators of the Coliseum Corrida, along with Zoro, Robin, Franky and the Dwarves, continue to hold back Doflamingo\u0027s diabolical trap with their bare hands. Robin keeps Leo\u0027s spirits up, telling him to have faith in Luffy as their last hope. Indeed, even though the Straw Hat is at the mercy of his adversary, he covers his arms with his Haki and reactivates the Gear Fourth to free himself from his bonds under Doflamingo\u0027s astonished eyes. Having regained his \u0022Bound-Man\u0022 form, Luffy is ready to finish off his enemy once and for all.\nTo do so, the Straw Hat flies as high as he can to execute his final attack. For his part, Doflamingo laughs at his adversary and chases him through the air before the astonished eyes of all Dressrosa\u0027s inhabitants, who don\u0027t miss a moment of the aerial combat that is about to take place between these two terrible pirates. Luffy is determined to put an end to Doflamingo\u0027s reign of tyranny, which has lasted for so many years, but Doflamingo has no intention of doing so. As Luffy prepares to attack, Doflamingo erects a spider\u0027s web to protect him from his adversary\u0027s attack. As he bands his arm with all his might, Luffy remembers Rayleigh\u0027s recommendations and adds Gear Third to his other fighting technique. Seeing what he\u0027s about to do, Doflamingo once again throws sharp threads that are stopped dead in their tracks by Luffy\u0027s huge fist. An immense shockwave sweeps through Dressrosa, frightening all its inhabitants. However, they continue to cheer on the Straw Hat, engaged in a veritable battle of the titans. Doflamingo doesn\u0027t give in and continues to attack Luffy, who holds back as best he can. Cheered on by all his friends and allies, the young pirate uses his \u0022Kong Gun\u0022 to send a powerful blast that pulverizes Doflamingo\u0027s ropes and himself in the process, causing the complete destruction of the lower town below the King\u0027s Plateau and further panic among the throngs of citizens who have flocked there. In the company of Rebecca and Viola, now safe, Trafalgar Law silently witnessed this prodigy and fondly recalled the words of his friend Corazon, who had once told him that powerful men feared the Family of the D because it was considered the sworn enemy of the gods. This truth was confirmed when Doflamingo was defeated by Luffy, an important member of the D-Family...",

        "description": "Doflamingo\u0027s defeat is complete. However, the people of Dressrosa must flee as quickly as possible to avoid being crushed by the rubble of the lower town, which was wiped out after Luffy\u0027s incredible punch. The rubble creates a huge hole all the way to the Trading Port, where Doflamingo falls. For his part, the Straw Hat savors his masterstroke: the island of Dressrosa is finally free of tyranny. Tears well up in her eyes as she witnesses this historic event, Rebecca can\u0027t take her eyes off the Straw Hat as it continues to fly overhead. Kyros\u0027s daughter can\u0027t help but recall her first meeting with Luffy, when he was still called Lucy. She clearly remembers the young pirate\u0027s admiration at the sight of the huge statue of the champion in the Coliseum Corrida. And now, Luffy has succeeded in freeing Dressrosa from Doflamingo\u0027s yoke and the young woman is very proud of this. For her part, Viola is also very grateful to the Straw Hat for having saved her kingdom, having been under the thumb of the sinister Doflamingo and his crew since childhood, and for having trusted him and his men when they decided to revolt against this former Celestial Dragon. As for Trafalgar Law, he watches attentively as the Straw Hat, exhausted, falls like a stone. He uses the power of his Demon Fruit to save him, swapping Luffy for a piece of debris to bring him back to the side of Rebecca and Viola, who are only too happy to find their rescuer alive.\nIn the gutted ruins of the Trading Port, Doflamingo is a shadow of his former self. He lost consciousness after being punched by Luffy. On the surface, the survivors of Dressrosa can breathe again and enjoy the new-found peace of their island. Young and old alike look up to see the \u0022Birdcage\u0022 beginning to disappear little by little. They want answers and beg Gats to explain what\u0027s going on. Supported by his two hostesses, the Colis\u00e9e Corrida\u0027s star presenter announces the Straw Hat\u0027s victory to the citizens of Dressrosa. They remember with sadness the ten long years of tyranny imposed by the Doflamingo Family on the country, and all weep with happiness at finally being freed from the cruel domination of the Shichibukai. For their part, the former gladiators, Dwarves and members of the Straw Hat Crew also see the Birdcage gradually disintegrating before their very eyes. All are delighted by this happy ending, as is Ussop, still clinging to Hack\u0027s shoulder, who is only too happy to see the sky again.\nPerched atop his promontory, Gats sees the devastation of the \u0022Birdcage\u0022 on Dressrosa and tells his fellow citizens about it. He reminds them of the exploits of the heroes of the Colis\u00e9e Corrida against Doflamingo\u0027s pirates, and of the final confrontation between the Shichibukai and Luffy. For his part, Riku remembers the dark hours that plunged Dressrosa and rejoices at the peace finally restored. The same joy spreads throughout the island, overwhelming the bravest warriors and the Tontattas tribe, who are overjoyed to have finally subdued their enemies. For her part, Rebecca, with her aunt\u0027s blessing, watches over Luffy, who is still unconscious. Not far away, Kinemon and Kanjuro can\u0027t hide their joy under Zoro\u0027s amused eye, while the Dwarves thank Franky appropriately. Even Kyros, who had never shown his feelings before, is overcome with emotion as he looks forward to a happy future for himself and his beloved daughter.\nWhile everyone applauds Luffy\u0027s courage, he has not yet regained consciousness...",

        "description": "Shouts of joy are heard all over Dressrosa, as the inhabitants are overjoyed to have finally regained their freedom and express their joy at the defeat of Doflamingo and all his officers.\nFor his part, Sabo inflicts heavy wounds on Jesus Burgess. He then receives a snail phone call from Koala, but doesn\u0027t pick up. Indeed, the Revolutionary Army\u0027s second-in-command is too focused on the words of his adversary, who continues to argue with him, trying to make him lose his temper while reporting Ace\u0027s last words to him before the latter is handed over to the Navy forces. Blackbeard\u0027s man still wants to get his hands on the Mera Mera no Mi and partially succeeds in his plan by pushing Sabo to the limit, but fails to slit his throat with his knife as his opponent was faster than him and knocks him out for good using his new gifts.\nAfter getting rid of Burgess, Sabo takes over the call and suffers the wrath of his colleague, who, in the company of Hack and a few men, doesn\u0027t appreciate the fact that her superior can ignore her. At the same time, navy troops are in action all over Dressrosa to apprehend the Doflamingo Family officers and their leader, who are still unconscious. The soldiers took precautions to subdue the pirates, using Sea Granite chains to annihilate the powers of their Demon Fruits. Baby 5, a member of Don Quixote Doflamingo\u0027s crew, watches from a distance as her former master\u0027s henchmen are sent to prison, before snuggling up to her fianc\u00e9, who is not quite used to her presence yet.\nAfter Navy soldiers chain Doflamingo with Sea Granite to put him out of action, some are astonished that Issho hasn\u0027t yet reported to Navy HQ. This suspicious detail even embarrasses Vice-Admiral Maynard, who decides to take matters into his own hands by making an initial report, while soldiers try to catch up with Fujitora so that he too can report to the Navy.\nAt the same time, in the neighboring country of Applenine and on two other islands, the inhabitants are worried because Doflamingo is about to speak, but instead of the King of Dressrosa, they see Maynard appear before their eyes to inform them of the defeat of the Shichibukai who had wanted to raze the island to the ground. As for the former king, Riku, the people put pressure on him to resume his duties as sovereign, under the amused gaze of Elizabello II, who happily comments on the situation after having telephoned the kings of the various neighboring countries to announce Riku\u0027s return to the throne of Dressrosa. The initiative of the King of Prodence is welcomed by the island\u0027s inhabitants, who are overjoyed to have finally found their authentic sovereign. Then Issho and his men appear and perform a rare act: they all kneel before Riku and his subjects and apologize, on behalf of the World Government, for the ordeal endured by the kingdom of Dressrossa during Doflamingo\u0027s ten-year tyranny.\nThroughout the world, this act was relayed by skimmers, along with the official announcement of the Alliance between the Straw Hats and the Heart Crew, who had together succeeded in defeating the most fearsome and dangerous Celestial Demon on the planet...",

        "description": "Riku is stunned to see a Navy Admiral and his men kneel before him and his people to make amends for Doflamingo\u0027s sins. The scene is broadcast by skirmishers around the world. The former ruler of Dressrosa asks Fujitora to stand up, but Fujitora refuses, retorting that this kingdom had been saved by incomparable pirates and warriors, while the Navy and the World Government didn\u0027t even lift a finger in the face of Doflamingo\u0027s actions. Meanwhile, Luffy and Law enjoy a well-deserved rest on the terrace of the Palais Royal, watched over by Viola and Rebecca, who are grateful to them for having restored freedom to their country. The calm is broken by Usopp, who is desperate to find out if the Straw Hat is still alive. He is accompanied by Zoro, Franky, Kinemon, Kanjuro and Robin, who are also searching for the young pirate.\nIn the lower town, Kyros savors the happiness of a new-found peace with the Dwarves of the Tontatta tribe, whom he considers to be valiant warriors. All are overwhelmed by emotion when Kyros announces the disbanding of the small army that had so faithfully served King Riku. However, the hero of the Coliseum Corrida promises that the people of Leo will still be useful in rebuilding Dressrosa and restoring their island to its former splendor. And everyone enthusiastically congratulates Kyros. As the people of Dressrosa tend to the wounded soldiers and citizens, Issho is informed by one of his men that the video broadcast to neighboring islands of their forgiveness of Riku and his people has been a success. For his part, Riku asks Tank, his most trusted man, to bring the pirates and warriors who had fought for them to the Royal Palace, along with the homeless, for treatment.\nMeanwhile, on the Holy Land of Marie-Joie, the Council of 5 Stars and Sakazuki are furious to learn of both Law and Luffy\u0027s defeat of Doflamingo and Admiral Issho\u0027s behavior in bowing to Riku and his people for his years of neglect. A swarm of Martins Factors travels the world to relay the news of Doflamingo\u0027s defeat, which stuns the whole world but is far from a happy event. Indeed, the warring kingdoms, pirates and other men who had made agreements with Doflamingo pitied their misfortune, as the latter, defeated, could no longer honor his commitments. At the same time, in the rest of the world, every member of the Worst Generation hears the news about Dressrosa, and Kaidou is informed by X. Drake of the defeat of his Smiles supplier. He then understands that smuggling with the latter is definitely over.\nBack in Dressrosa: Fujitora receives a snail phone call from Sakazuki, who sternly lectures him on his attitude. While somewhere in the New World, Smoker, still convalescing on a Navy ship transporting the children of Punk Hazard Island to Dr. Vegapunk\u0027s lair for treatment, learns of Fujitora\u0027s actions from the newspapers and is surprised, as is his faithful Tashigi. Their superior, Sakazuki, orders Fujitora to immediately capture Law and Luffy and then to report back to him, an order Issho has been eagerly awaiting...",

        "description": "On the heights of Carta, north of the island of Dressrosa, the Straw Hats, Law, Bellamy, Kinemon and Kanjuro take a rest in the house of Kyros, who had offered them hospitality. Sabo arrives shortly afterwards to see Luffy, and all his friends are shocked to learn that he is Luffy\u0027s brother, except Robin, who already knew. Sabo then reveals that CP-AIGIS0 is in Dressrosa and must leave the island as soon as possible. The second-in-command of the Revolutionary Army advises the Straw Hats to do the same, to avoid capture by the World Government.\nThe members of the Straw Hat Crew are still astonished to learn that Ace and Luffy had another brother whom they both believed to be dead. And it\u0027s with this confession that Sabo begins to recount his past. He, Ace and Luffy had been inseparable friends since childhood. They dreamed of becoming pirates. But the day Sabo left his island, he had the misfortune to cross paths with a Celestial Dragon, who fired on his ship to sink it for flying a pirate flag. Sabo did what he could to contain the fire that was ravaging his boat, when Saint Jalmack fired a second salvo from his carbine, blowing the boat apart. Sabo wasn\u0027t dead on the spot, however, and just as he was about to drown, he was saved in extremis by Monkey D. Dragon, Luffy\u0027s own father! He took his young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to his ship for treatment, and Sabo met the rest of his crew and Emporio Ivankov, who was astonished to meet such a sickly child. Dragon gave Sabo first aid, and he woke up after his rescuer\u0027s ship had left his island and ventured out to sea. With his body covered in bandages, the young boy learned that he had been rescued by the Revolutionary Army, but had completely lost his memory. Dragon tries to jog his memory, telling him that his first name is Sabo and that he met him one night on a street corner at the time of the Grey Terminal fire. Luffy\u0027s father thinks he\u0027s a nobleman and that it would be a good idea to bring him back to his family. But Sabo, who still hasn\u0027t recovered his memory, refuses and begs Dragon to stay with him.\nAs Sabo recounts his past to the Straw Hats, the people of Dressrosa enthusiastically set about repairing the Royal Palace, while the fighters of the Coliseum Corrida take a well-deserved rest. But Bartolomeo is worried about Cavendish\u0027s presence here. He fears that the pirate with the rose will turn into Hakuba in his sleep, so he decides to chain Cavendish against his will.\nBack to the Kyros house. Sabo continues his story, explaining to Luffy\u0027s friends that he had completely lost his memory when he joined the Revolutionary Army and never wanted to return to his father, Outlook III. He accompanied Dragon and his men to their headquarters in Baltigo, to perfect his training as a revolutionary fighter. Under Hack\u0027s guidance, young Sabo practiced the art of combat, although he had retained the ability to move his body brilliantly despite the loss of his memory. Despite his lack of academic talent, Sabo learned everything he needed to know if he was ever to become a leading member of the Revolutionary Army, even taking on the formidable Bartholomew Kuma. Meanwhile, on the island of Dawn, Ace and Luffy, who still believe that their friend Sabo is no longer of this world, solemnly contemplate waiting until they\u0027re 17 to set sail and become pirates. As the years go by, Sabo befriends the young Koala, who is not pleased to see the young boy raiding the crew\u0027s food supplies. Despite these outbursts, Sabo continues his training, taking on the immense Kuma without batting an eyelid, who gives him a humiliating beating. It was at this time that he adopted his weapon: a long pipe that can be doubled for those who know how to handle it well, but Sabo was no match for Dragon and Kuma at this little game.\nOn the other side of East Blue, 17-year-old Ace set sail to become a pirate, as he had sworn. Luffy watched him set sail with a heart full of enthusiasm, unaware that Sabo, whom they thought had disappeared, was risking his life on a battlefield in an unknown land. But he was a real dead man\u0027s fool, and despite the machine-gun fire whistling in his ears, he succeeded with disconcerting ease in opening the gates of a stronghold thanks to his mastery of the Fluid. Thanks to this gift, the young boy took control of the situation, overpowering his enemies one by one with the sheer force of his arms. Meanwhile, his friend Koala was busy evacuating the citizens trapped in the fortress. After Sabo had shown everyone his new abilities, the fortress was completely pulverized. Thanks to this feat, the 17-year-old was able to lead the entire Revolutionary Army, until he learned of the promising future of a young pirate named Portgas D. Ace, a name that strangely brought back his memories. Two years later, Luffy left his native island to pursue his own adventures.\nBack to the present: Franky asks Sabo how he managed to recover his memories, and Sabo replies that it was Ace who had helped him awaken his memory...",

        "description": "Sabo returns to Baltigo after completing several crucial missions, and on the way he seems to dreamily see two figures from his past who call out to him before being interrupted by his friend Koala, who is delighted to be back at Revolutionary Army headquarters. Sabo is also anxious to get back there to provide Dragon with a full report on the operations he has carried out. When Sabo and Koala arrive in Baltigo, they notice quite a commotion. The cause of the commotion is the end of the war at the top in Marineford. When one of his subordinates calls out the names of the illustrious people who perished during the war, the name Portgas D. Ace catches Sabo\u0027s attention as if it were a name he knew well. He then examines a newspaper photo of the deceased, which brings back memories of his childhood. Tears begin to flow from his eyes and he can\u0027t contain them, much to the surprise of Koala, who doesn\u0027t understand what\u0027s happening. As soldiers from the Revolutionary Army explain how Ace was killed by Akainu, Sabo is overwhelmed by emotion and continues to weep uncontrollably over the article recounting the death of Luffy\u0027s brother. Suddenly, recalling the sake ceremony that allowed Luffy, Sabo and Ace to become brothers in their own right, the Revolutionary Army\u0027s second-in-command feels his memory returning and, staggering, he remembers that Ace with Burning Fists is his brother before fainting. When Sabo comes to, his friends are relieved to see him regain consciousness. Koala had been very worried about him and had feared for his life. However, Sabo had regained his memory and asked her to call Dragon to talk to him.\nBack to Dressrosa. In Kyros\u0027s house, everyone was fast asleep except Kinemon, Kanjuro, Zoro, Robin and Franky, who hadn\u0027t missed a beat of Sabo\u0027s story. Sabo went on to reveal that it was Ace\u0027s death that had restored his memory. He even visited Ace\u0027s grave and that of Whitebeard, who had died at the same time as Ace in Marineford. Sabo praised Ace\u0027s progress, saying that Luffy was well on the way to becoming King of the Pirates one day. Then he uncorks a bottle of sake and fills three bowls as he did when they were children. After collecting himself, he calls Koala by snail phone to ask a favor of the Revolutionary Army by helping them acquire the Mera Mera no Mi. In this way, Sabo took part in the tournament held at the Coliseum Corrida, taking Luffy\u0027s place when he was shocked to discover that his brother, whom he had thought dead, was still alive. Bartolomeo, who witnessed this touching reunion, didn\u0027t hide his emotions either. The Straw Hat granted Sabo permission to eat the Mera Mera no Mi in memory of Ace.\nHaving finished his tale, Sabo took leave of Luffy\u0027s friends and handed Zoro a Life Card after tearing off a piece to find himself. As the second-in-command of the Revolutionary Army leaves Kyros\u0027 house, Zoro can\u0027t help but think back to Ace\u0027s farewell to Alabasta. He was behaving in the same way as Sabo. Sabo received a snail phone call as he was leaving Kyros\u0027s house. It was his friend Hack, concerned about Luffy\u0027s state of health. His superior told him he was fine before hanging up. At the same time, Issho was with his men. The Navy Admiral is playing dice to find out Luffy\u0027s future. As Fujitora is blind, he asks one of his soldiers to tell him the value of the dice that came up. When the soldier told him it was one, Fujitora decreed that the Straw Hat was the winner and would not be stopped tonight. This kind of attitude greatly displeases Vice Admiral Maynard, who fears an affront to Admiral Sakazuki. But Issho puts his subordinate in his place by telling him that you can\u0027t fight fate.\nMeanwhile, at the Royal Palace, the fighters and citizens who survived Dressrosa want to thank Luffy for his bravery, but the Straw Hat is nowhere to be found. For her part, Rebecca runs to see her grandfather because she\u0027s worried about not seeing her father and Luffy at the Royal Palace. Riku reassures his granddaughter that Kyros is with the Straw Hat and his friends, who are all safe and sound. While chatting with him, the young gladiatrix learns that if her grandfather becomes King of Dressrosa again, she will assume the role of princess. While Rebecca is shocked by this news, Sabo is on the back of a huge bird which takes her to Baltigo to inform Dragon that his son Luffy is well...",

        "description": "Luffy and his companions continue to enjoy Kyros\u0027s hospitality and take a well-deserved rest at his home. Only Robin, Zoro and Franky remain awake. Still shaken by the story Sabo had told them, they are disappointed that Luffy was not conscious when the brother he thought had disappeared was there. Suddenly, Kyros wakes up and confesses to his hosts that he has listened to most of Sabo\u0027s story. He also lamented the fact that Luffy hadn\u0027t followed his story, but he had to sleep and rest first after the hard day he\u0027d been through. The hero of the Colis\u00e9e Corrida suggested that Zoro look for some alcohol in his cellar. The Swordsman of the Straw Hat Crew gladly accepts.\nKyros is grateful to Luffy for liberating his country and hopes with all his heart that Dressrosa will aspire to better days. He suddenly thinks of his daughter Rebecca and all the suffering they endured together while all the pirates fell into a well-deserved sleep. He takes advantage of this respite to write a letter, then sets off for the Royal Palace to hand-deliver it to his daughter.\nAt the same time, on a raging sea, Sanji\u0027s group, made up of Tony Tony Chopper and C\u00e9sar Clown, are on their way to Zou, but they have to face Big Mom\u0027s ship, which is doing everything it can to capture them in order to get their hands on the Punk Hazard scientist. Luffy\u0027s friends manage to outrun their pursuers and find themselves on an island. But their group is cut in two and Sanji finds himself with Chopper and Caesar, who are reluctant to move forward. Meanwhile, Nami, Brook and Momonosuke are chased by two mysterious individuals (Sheepshead and Gin Rummy), riding a huge crocodile, who eventually catch up with them. However, they are saved by a huge downpour which allows them to escape, but they are swept away in a violent torrent. Once all danger had passed, the three fugitives managed to cling onto a branch. But this respite is short-lived, as their enemies have found their tracks and are trying to kill them. As one of the assailants tries to strike Nami with his sword, his blow is stopped by Brook\u0027s fencing skills. The living skeleton proves to be an excellent swordsman, especially when his attacker tries to defeat him with his strange powers. As Brook valiantly fights off his opponent, he sees Sanji appear from the sky to lend him a hand. Thanks to his skill, the Thousand Sunny cook manages to throw his enemy into the water, while his acolytes flee, lamenting the absence of a mysterious samurai who was supposed to accompany Sanji and his friends.\nSuddenly, the flood caused by the immense downpour comes to an end. Brook and Nami wonder about the island they landed on, and whether the girl they rescued is all right. For his part, Sanji lights a cigarette while looking at his mysterious assailant, who had not risen after his defeat and is puzzled by the skull and crossbones motif on his belt. Suddenly, Momonosuke hears cries coming from the forest. It\u0027s the voice of Chopper, who must be in great danger. All his friends rush to his rescue, abandoning their enemy to his fate.\nSomewhere in the New World, in the Kid\u0027s pirate hideaway, the mood is festive. Suddenly, a huge explosion puts an end to the festivities, causing panic among the pirates and the capsizing of their ships. Eustass Kid rushes out to see what\u0027s going on and, horrified, he and his men discover a huge, human-shaped hole in the ground! Basil Hawkins, who accompanies him, deduces that it is someone who has fallen from a celestial island. It is indeed someone who has come from the sky, and more precisely from the ruined Terminal Ballon city where Urouge lives. The latter met a mysterious man who wanted to commit suicide because he was fed up with life. He jumped from the celestial island, 10,000 meters above sea level, under the amused eyes of the Mad Monk, and, after an interminable fall, landed in Eustass Kid\u0027s lair to everyone\u0027s surprise. The pirates approached to find out who had come to attack them, only to recoil abruptly when they realized they were dealing with a giant with the ability not to die. The mysterious man rises to his feet and reveals himself to be the most powerful Pirate in the world, Kaidou of the Hundred Beasts, who is about to embark on the greatest war the world has ever known...",

        "description": "Three days after Doflamingo\u0027s defeat and Luffy\u0027s victory, Admiral Issho receives a surprise visit from Sengoku and Tsuru, who have personally visited Dressrosa to find out why he hasn\u0027t yet apprehended the Straw Hats. Fujitora replies that Luffy\u0027s fate is in the hands of providence, and that for three days in a row luck has been on his side. The three naval officers then receive a visit from Mansherry, who asks for blood donations to treat the island\u0027s inhabitants. Meanwhile, Gats triumphantly announces the official return of King Riku to the throne of Dressrosa. The latter talks to his friend Elizabello II, telling him that he will try to keep his people happy while waiting for his granddaughter Rebecca to inherit his crown. At the same time, Kyros pays his respects at his wife\u0027s grave and remembers the days when he was still a toy soldier.\nAll over the island, Navy soldiers are distributing Princess Mansherry\u0027s medicinal flowers to heal the population. But suddenly, Kinemon and Kanjuro, who witnessed the scene, discover that the troops stationed at Dressrosa are increasing in numbers and decide to warn their friends of the impending assault by the Navy. While Mansherry receives blood donations from all sides to heal the people of Dressrosa, Fujitora humbly asks Tsuru to roll the dice for him. If \u00221\u0022 comes up as on other days, he won\u0027t launch an attack. But if not, he and his men would immediately set off to arrest Luffy and Law. Incredulous, Tsuru complies.\nNot far away, in Kyros\u0027 house, Luffy and all his friends have recovered and are regaining their strength by devouring the victuals brought by Kinemon and Kanjuro. The two samurai tell them about the rumor spreading around the island that Rebecca\u0027s father is a prince from a faraway land, although they all know the truth. However, Kyros confesses that it was he who started the rumor to protect his daughter and to prevent the people of Dressrosa from knowing that he was Rebecca\u0027s real father. Indeed, her birth was known only to members of the royal family and to the Doflamingo family, who had done some research. This news came as a surprise to all his friends, who didn\u0027t understand what he had done. Kyros reveals that he was ashamed of his criminal past and wanted to offer Rebecca a better future. For this reason, he had written her a letter explaining that his presence at her side was incompatible with her future life as a princess, and that she should forget him and finally lead a happy life without hiding. The former Colis\u00e9e Corrida champion was even thinking of leaving Dressrosa at the same time as the Straw Hats, so as to stay out of his daughter\u0027s life. Suddenly, they receive a snail phone call from Leo, who warns Kyros that Fujitora is on the move. Tsuru had fired the \u0022six\u0022, and Issho immediately ordered his men to arrest all the pirates on Dressrosa, including Law and all the criminals hiding in the Royal Palace. Bartolomeo, meanwhile, appears to inform Luffy and his friends that Navy troops will be arriving at any moment to arrest them. Indeed, after issuing his order, all Fujitrora\u0027s men set off in search of the fugitives, despite their services in the island\u0027s liberation, with the sole aim of apprehending them...",

        "description": "Navy soldiers, armed to the teeth, scour the streets of Dressrosa in search of fugitives, while others cordon off all access to take to the sea. Admiral Fujitora himself orchestrated the operation, with the help of Vice-Admiral Bastille. At the same time, in Kyros\u0027s home, he receives a snail phone call from Leo, who warns him that the Navy will soon arrest their friends. This situation displeases Usopp, who begins to panic as usual, especially knowing that they have no ship to flee to.\nIn the streets of the island\u0027s capital, Fujitora\u0027s troops deploy to arrest as many criminals as possible without the civilian population being able to intervene. Some soldiers head for the Royal Palace, where dozens of warriors who helped liberate Dressrosa have taken refuge. Leo warns Bartolomeo, who is with the Straw Hats, of the imminent danger. But Bartolomeo reassures him that he has planned ahead, as his men and allies, including Cavendish, have decided to lend a hand in helping the Mugiwara flee, after watching the Navy\u0027s movements for some time. He invites Luffy and his companions, including Bellamy, who has fully recovered from his wounds, to follow him towards the eastern port, where a ship is waiting to take them away from Dressrosa.\nJust as everyone is ready to leave Kyros\u0027s house, the Navy troops have found their tracks and are on their way to capture them. Bartolomeo tells his friends to flee as quickly as possible. They obey as the soldiers fire on them. To protect them from the heavy fire, Bartolomeo uses his powers to create a barrier to stop their attackers\u0027 bullets. Luffy and his friends run like hell to lose their pursuers, who continue to shoot at them. Bartolomeo asks them not to split up and to avoid crossing Fujitora\u0027s path. However, Luffy doesn\u0027t give a damn and stops running, much to the astonishment of his biggest fan. He explains to his comrades that he has one last thing to do before heading for the south of the island, which is teeming with hundreds of soldiers. The Straw Hat easily disposes of his opponents before heading for the Royal Palace.\nAt the same time, at the Palace, King Riku summons his loyal Tank to look for Viola and Rebecca, so that the two young women can accompany him to warn the island\u0027s citizens that the Riku Family has officially taken over the throne of Dressrosa. The latter complies immediately, while Viola, who has used her Clairvoyance, informs her niece that Luffy and his companions are being pursued by the Navy and are about to leave Dressrosa. Kyros\u0027s daughter is distressed to learn that her savior will soon be leaving, as she really wanted to thank him for all he had done for Dressrosa.\nFor their part, Tsuru and his elite soldiers set off, as does Issho. At the same time, near Carta Hill, Bartolomeo led the Straw Hats through the town, reassuring them that they had nothing to fear. Indeed, their allies had already occupied the East Port and dislodged the Navy garrison there, much to Bastille\u0027s frustration as he gradually loses his composure. Abdullah, Jeet and their comrades-in-arms had disabled all the soldiers stationed there, clearing the way for the Straw Hats to reach the port unharmed. A member of the Navy garrison informs Bastille that the criminals who were supposed to have taken refuge in the Palais Royal are helping the fugitives to escape. The Vice-Admiral realizes that there\u0027s no one left to arrest when Luffy suddenly appears.\nAs he tries to outrun the Navy, he runs into trouble with his elastic left arm, which has jammed. Swinging unwillingly through the air, he managed to knock out dozens of soldiers who had come to arrest him. Far from being discouraged, Luffy managed to reach the Field of Flowers, but soon found himself surrounded by Marine soldiers ready to do battle with him. This little inconvenience doesn\u0027t worry the Straw Hat, who sweeps aside his enemies with a wave of his hand before shouting Rebecca\u0027s name. Rebecca rushes to the window and sees the Straw Hat fighting the Marine while looking for her. Rebecca signals her presence and Luffy rushes to meet her, grabbing the window bars with his elastic arms. Despite the guards protecting the young princess, the captain of the Straw Hat Crew asks her if she\u0027s willing to forget her father, as he\u0027d requested in his letter. Rebecca is all debriefed and finally tells him that she couldn\u0027t bring herself to do such a thing. So she decides to follow the Straw Hat to see Kyros again, despite Viola\u0027s pleas. Rebecca managed to convince her aunt of her willingness before fleeing the palace, clinging to Luffy\u0027s neck as he burst the bars of the window. The young pirate, taking his friend with him, launched himself into the void under the noses of the Navy soldiers, while one of the palace servants warned Riku of his granddaughter\u0027s abduction. The latter is immediately enraged to learn that Rebecca\u0027s kidnapper is none other than Luffy! This news sends shockwaves through Dressrosa\u0027s population, including Gats, who believes that the Straw Hat is really responsible for kidnapping the princess.\nWith Luffy and Rebecca on the run, Maynard\u0027s Marine forces give chase. Just as his best snipers are about to take down the Straw Hat, they are stopped by an unknown force, similar to the Haki of Kings, without losing consciousness. This turn of events exasperates Bastille, who is unaware that Fujitora is behind it all. The Vice-Admiral orders all available warships to the East Port and all able-bodied men to Carta to arrest the fugitives. Just as the Straw Hats manage to reach the harbor entrance, Sengoku, who is standing there in the company of a huge gorilla, spots them. At the same time, Luffy and Rebecca leap from rooftop to rooftop to reach Kyros\u0027 house. But they are spotted by citizens who pursue them with soldiers who order them to arrest Luffy. But the Straw Hat laughs at them and continues his frantic escape with his \u0022prisoner\u0022, leaping from building to building...",

        "description": "The citizens of Dressrosa continue to pursue Luffy, who is said to have kidnapped Rebecca when the young girl had decided to accompany him of her own free will to find her father. Losing his pursuers, the Straw Hat and his friend come face to face with a Marine platoon ready to fire on them. Instead of bullets, they are hit by nets made of Sea Granite. Luffy is trapped by one of them and loses his strength, much to Rebecca\u0027s astonishment. The two fugitives are soon surrounded by the soldiers who had been ordered to capture the Straw Hat alive. But Luffy doesn\u0027t give in, and uses his powers to sow havoc with the Navy, to the detriment of Rebecca, who is unaccustomed to gliding through the air. After making sure they were no longer being followed, Luffy asks Rebecca to continue on her own while he creates a diversion. The young princess obeyed. He also asks her not to be captured, or she\u0027ll be returned to the Royal Palace. Luffy then shows her the location of Kyros\u0027s house, right in the heart of the Flower Field, and advises her to go there right away before her father leaves. The latter gathers up all his belongings and prepares to leave Dressrosa, not without a certain amount of regret, as everything dear to him is on this island: his daughter, his past and his memories.\nRebecca, for her part, has to cross a vast forest to reach her father\u0027s house, and on the way she relives her childhood memories of the time when she was happy and pampered by her mother Scarlet and father Kyros. Then came the difficult times when she lost her mother, despite the promise of Soldier Lightning Fury to do everything in his power to protect her. Rebecca runs breathlessly to stop her father from leaving. At the same time, he grabbed the handle of the door to his house to leave. But as he leaves, he too plunges back into his deepest memories of the time when Sugar had condemned him to life as a toy. He recalls his daughter\u0027s birthday party and all the joy he felt at being with her. However, he knew Rebecca\u0027s true place was in the Palais Royal, far away from him. As he was leaving his house, he came face to face with his daughter, her face sweaty and her dress torn after her mad run in the forest. Kyros couldn\u0027t believe his eyes: his beloved daughter was standing in front of him. Rebecca can\u0027t help crying. She knew that her father had spread false rumors and that she\u0027d had enough of the lies because she was Kyros\u0027s daughter. What she wanted now was to live with her father, whether he liked it or not. He agreed, and father and daughter embraced, weeping with joy.\nMeanwhile, at the Palais Royal, Viola talks to her father about Rebecca and tells him she\u0027ll never live with them again. Riku accepts his granddaughter\u0027s decision and understands that the ties that bind a daughter to her father are stronger than anything. Especially as Rebecca, like her mother before her, had asked her aunt to be Princess of Dressrosa in her place, and her aunt had agreed. At the same time, at the entrance to the Eastern Port, everyone, including Ussop, was eagerly awaiting Luffy\u0027s return. As the pirates began to bicker amongst themselves, Zoro spotted Admiral Fujitora, flying on a levitating wall, coming ahead of them to stop them. The Swordsman of the Straw Hat Crew tries to stop him using his fencing skills, but to no avail. For his part, Vice-Admiral Bastille, from his HQ, coordinates the encirclement of the Eastern Port with the aim of catching the pirates in a pincer movement. But his plan is foiled by the intervention of the Tontatta warriors, who have managed to steal the powder, bullets and all the soldiers\u0027 weapons without their knowledge. This news exasperates Bastille, who can\u0027t keep his cool. He also learns that the warships the Navy had assembled to capture the fugitives have been out of action since they were mysteriously sewn together. The height of Bastille\u0027s annoyance is reached when he realizes that a large number of soldiers were still fainting after donating blood to Princess Mansherry so that she could heal many of the still-injured citizens.\nAt the same time, the Straw Hat allies had to face Issho, who was advancing alone in front of them. Despite his blindness, the Navy Admiral is not afraid to confront these dangerous criminals, who are doing everything they can to delay him so that Luffy and Law can join them quickly. As he sets off for the Eastern Port, Luffy realizes that the fighting has already begun. For his part, Law meets up with Sengoku, who reminisces about their shared past and laments the loss of the Barrels Pirates, killed by Doflamingo, the Ope Ope no Mi, his subordinate, Corazon, whom he considered his son, and a young boy suffering from lead poisoning whom Rosinante had promised to help cure. To his astonishment, Trafalgar Law reveals that he was indeed the boy...",

He also tells him that he\u0027s a D, a confession that makes the former Admiral Commander-in-Chief of the Navy\u0027s blood run cold. Meanwhile, Admiral Fujitora takes it upon himself to personally eliminate all pirates on Dressrosa, preventing them from fleeing the island. However, Bartolomeo prevents him from carrying out his plan by erecting an impenetrable barrier in front of him. Issho is unimpressed by the pirate\u0027s power and uses his own powers to levitate all the debris on the island to form a huge, menacing cloud over his opponents. Meanwhile, Vice-Admiral Bastille receives a snail phone call from Tsuru asking if he still needs reinforcements. He replies that his men must withdraw quickly from the Eastern Port, as Fujitora has taken the lead. Not far away, on the Field of Flowers, Kyros and Rebecca witness this prodigy and the young princess worries about Luffy and the wrong turn of events.\nSuddenly, Law arrives at the entrance to the Eastern Port and orders Cavendish to set sail immediately, as there is nowhere safe on Dressrosa, while Zoro is certain that Issho will not let the pirates escape Dressrosa so easily. The latter is still determined to stop the Navy\u0027s enemies when Luffy arrives. His friends see him approaching them at full speed and advise him to run to a ship and leave Dressrosa. But the Straw Hat refuses to run away from Issho. He\u0027d rather fight Issho with a terrible Elephant Gun that crushes the Admiral on the spot than have to leave, because if he did that he\u0027d no longer be worthy of becoming King of the Pirates. His friends, led by Zoro, agree with him, but are astonished by Luffy\u0027s fighting techniques against Issho.\nWhile fighting him, the Straw Hat announces his attacks in advance out of pity for his opponent\u0027s blindness, arousing his anger. Using his gifts, Fujitora throws Luffy into the air with his sword, but the latter can\u0027t stop him...",

        "description": "Luffy is hit by Fujitora\u0027s attack, which sends him flying. However, Cavendish catches sight of him and orders Hajrudin to catch the Straw Hat in flight and bring him safely back to land. Despite Luffy\u0027s refusal to stop fighting the Navy Admiral, Cavendish orders the Elbaf giant to take him to their ship and flee Dressrosa as quickly as possible. As Zoro tries to take over by fighting Issho, Bartolomeo dissuades him by reminding him of the terms of their arrangement. At the same time, in the Eastern Port, Ussop, accompanied by Orombus, sees dozens of ships lined up one behind the other, all linked by a huge floating bridge five thousand sailors long. This gigantic armada, ready for departure, was only waiting for the Straw Hats to leave King Riku\u0027s kingdom for good.\nHajrudin and his companions arrived at the port and hurried aboard, despite the anger of Luffy, who wished to continue his duel with Issho. The latter, unhappy to see that the pirates were fleeing, unleashed his fury and sent the cloud of debris he had just accumulated over the huge Yonte Maria Fleet moored in the harbor. By sheer force of thought, Fujitora agglomerates all these fragments into a huge mass which he uses to strike at his enemies. Seeing the huge cloud approaching them, the pirates take fright and try to accelerate their escape from the danger.\nFor his part, Hajrudin continues to run across the floating bridge, shaking the whole structure with his enormous weight. He\u0027s still holding Luffy, who hasn\u0027t fully digested the fact that his friends dared to interrupt his fight. However, the atmosphere becomes heavy as the cloud Issho has created obscures the sun\u0027s rays and threatens to fall on the fleeing pirates. Without exception, they all board their chartered ships to escape the wrath of Admiral Fujitora. In Dressrosa, Gats witnesses this prodigy and tells his fellow citizens, who watch helplessly as the gigantic pile of debris moves out to sea. Even King Riku and his family are shocked and fear for the lives of the Straw Hats.\nKnowing that the pirates had no possible escape, Fujitora threatens to bring down the rubble on the fugitives, which would sink their ships. He detonated his cloud and spread it over the entire fleet. The crew, alarmed, are aware of the danger. For their part, Usopp and his comrades continue to run on the floating bridge while Issho puts his plan into action. But he is prevented from doing so by the citizens of Dressrosa, who want to get rid of the pirates themselves, as they were the main culprits behind their country\u0027s misfortunes. Issho lets them, continuing to levitate the huge pile of rubble that still threatens to fall on the enemy ships. Crowds flock to the Eastern Port to hunt down the pirates.\nAt the Royal Palace, Viola witnesses the scene thanks to her Clairvoyance and reports everything she sees to her father. At the same time, Luffy asks Hajrudin to release his embrace to see what\u0027s going on. Perching on the shoulder of the giant, who is still running, the young pirate sees the people of Dressrosa crowding the harbor in the distance. The latter led Fujitora to believe that he hated pirates, when in fact the opposite was true. Issho learns that Rebecca had returned to live with her father Kyros in his house on the Field of Flowers, and that she had never been kidnapped by the Straw Hat. He also understood that, if all those civilians continued to follow Luffy, he wouldn\u0027t dare drop rubble from the sky at the risk of killing innocent people. This was what Gats had deduced, and he encouraged all his fellow citizens to run towards the Eastern Port to facilitate their hero\u0027s escape. This token of appreciation cheered up the pirates, who continued to run towards their ships. For his part, Fujitora could only let it happen, despite his duties as Admiral of the Navy, and felt a certain joy for Luffy, whose facial features he would have loved to see, which must surely have been filled with kindness. Knowing that he could do nothing more against the Straw Hat, he wondered how he was going to get rid of the immense cloud of debris he had accumulated, much to the incomprehension of Bastille, who couldn\u0027t understand why his colleague hadn\u0027t yet taken action.\nOn the floating deck, Bartolomeo has the pleasure of introducing the Straw Hats to the Yonte Maria, the gigantic flagship of the Yonte Maria Fleet. All board the ship, where Cavendish, Bartolomeo, Xai, Ideo, Hajrudin, Orumbus and even Leo swear allegiance to Luffy with their respective crews, a total strength of 5,600 men. Luffy watches in disbelief as Bartolomeo asks him to become their leader and to take them under his wing...",

        "description": "All the pirates connected with Doflamingo are seething with rage after reading in the newspapers about the defeat of the Shichibukai by the alliance formed by Luffy and Law. They decide to form an alliance to eliminate Luffy and his allies, and set off for Dressrosa to prevent the Straw Hat from leaving the island, at the risk of laying waste to the kingdom of the Riku Family.\nAt the same time, in Dressrosa, under the constant threat of the huge cloud of debris that floats in the sky like an immense sword of Damocles, Bartolomeo pours sake into every cup of his allies to seal their alliance with the Straw Hat. But Luffy declines their offer to join his crew and refuses to drink the cup of sake offered to him, telling them that they could always come to his aid whenever he needed it, as he would do himself. Bartolomeo believes that, if he is ever to become King of the Pirates, the Straw Hat always wants to remain free and independent.\nJust as everything was working out for them, pirates, who were in business with Doflamingo, attack the Yonte Maria Fleet, but are immediately stopped by Fujitora, who gives Luffy a \u0022parting gift\u0022 by dropping debris on the enemy ships. Despite this incident, the Straw Hat\u0027s new allies still wish to pledge their allegiance to him and, before Luffy\u0027s astonished eyes, drink their sake cups in front of him while swearing to always be at his disposal when he needs them. After swearing this oath, Luffy becomes angry. But he can\u0027t help realizing that yesterday\u0027s enemies had sworn their loyalty to him, and there was no turning back now that a huge feast had been prepared in his honor to celebrate their victory over the Don Quixote family.\nOn the orders of Orombus and his subordinates, the Yonte Maria Fleet set sail from Dressrosa with all sails set, despite the rubble falling on it. Strangely enough, the debris missed its target, falling to one side, much to the incomprehension of Vice-Admiral Bastille. The person responsible for this debacle was none other than Issho, who did it to thank Luffy for putting an end to Doflamingo\u0027s crimes. But the venerable Admiral of the Navy is surprised by Sengoku who, strangely enough, doesn\u0027t hold it against him for helping outlaws escape justice.\nAs the Straw Hat pirates and their new allies celebrate on their ship, Luffy fondly recalls all his adventures on Dressrosa, including his arrival on the island, his discovery of the Toys, his meeting with Fujitora and his participation in the tournament held at the Colis\u00e9e Corrida to win the Mera Mera no Mi, the Demon Fruit once held by Ace and now belonging to his brother Sabo. He also remembers Rebecca and her promise to defeat Doflamingo once and for all to free Dressrosa from his tyranny. For her part, the ex-gladiatrix of the Coliseum Corrida stands by her father and watches the departure of the imposing armada. Rebecca wonders if she\u0027ll ever see Luffy again. Kyros reassures her that she will, before father and daughter start teasing each other. The same joy can be seen aboard the ships carrying the Straw Hats and their allies. All are looking forward to a delicious feast as they head off together to their next destination...",

Only Law is not celebrating, and seems preoccupied. Looking at the horizon, he is joined by Nico Robin, who points out that Dressrosa\u0027s ribs have long since disappeared. She asks him what he intends to do now that Dofamingo has been defeated. He simply replies not to worry about him.\nAt the same time, Rob Lucci, who has joined the ranks of CP0, is sitting next to Spandam in an alleyway in Dressrosa\u0027s capital and learns via snail phone that the revolutionary army has succeeded in stealing all the weapons stored in the Trading Port. Meanwhile, despite the devastation on the island, the citizens of Dressrosa are happily rebuilding their city. For their part, the dwarves, who have now come out of hiding, live in harmony with the humans, helping them to build statues in effigy of the liberators of the kingdom of Dressrosa before rebuilding their homes.\nFar from Dressrosa, on a stormy sea, a Navy fleet sails towards Impel Down. On one of the ships, Admiral Fujitora is enjoying a bowl of noodles in the company of Sengoku, who asks him to apologize to Sakazuki immediately, but Sakazuki refuses to do so, as it would sully his honor. Down in the hold, Doflamingo, locked up and chained, has not lost his legendary anger and curses Fujitora from the depths of his cell. Vice-Admiral Tsuru questions Doflamingo, asking what is to become of the reign of piracy. Doflamingo replied that a great war was about to begin, during which all the world\u0027s greatest pirates would be pitted against each other. At the same time, a certain Captain Jack was planning to free Doflamingo from his floating prison with the help of his men, and was preparing to attack the Navy fleet.\nNot far away, under a brilliant sky, Law and the Straw Hats are aboard Bartolomeo\u0027s ship, which has been fitted with a new figurehead in honor of Luffy and his crew. The Bartoclub leader is only too happy to have received a piece of Luffy\u0027s Life Card, which Sabo had left with his friends before he left to join the revolutionary army.

Suddenly, just as all was going well, the sky darkens and a shower of giant hailstones descends on Going Luffy-senpai, threatening to crush him. Fortunately, Luffy is there and uses one of his super-powered combat techniques to blast the hailstones into the air, as Bartolomeo looks on in amazement.\nShortly afterwards, the hailstones stopped raining and everyone was able to enjoy a well-deserved rest, sleeping on deck under the stars. But Luffy is suddenly seized by a sudden craving and heads for the galley to eat. Bartolomeo decides to accompany him when a sudden burst of meat appears in the sky, which Luffy rushes to grab. His companion tries to dissuade him by holding on to him. In fact, the meat was bait used by unscrupulous pirates intent on capturing the Straw Hat. However, they were dismayed to discover that they had also netted Bartolomeo, who was not part of their plan. Nevertheless, Desire, the pirate leader, is pleased with the result, as are her men, who are very happy to have managed to catch a fearsome pirate with a simple piece of meat. On deck, Zoro notices a commotion and discovers that Luffy and Bartolomeo have disappeared. Desire sees that almost all the members of the Straw Hat Crew are there and launches an attack against them. Zoro, Usopp and Franky defend themselves as best they can, but they\u0027re no match for their opponents\u0027 cannonballs, which explode, spraying them with oatmeal and immobilizing them in place. Seeing that she could no longer fear them, Desire orders her men to take their two prisoners back to their base.\n\nBartolomeo wakes up in a mine where he is forced to dig under Peseta\u0027s guard, while Luffy finds himself locked in a cell and immobilized in a huge silver marble made by Bill, a mysterious man who is eager to get to know him. But the Straw Hat has only one preoccupation: to eat. He demands meat from Desire, who refuses to give it to him, but relents and gives him a piece of chocolate to finally have some peace.\n\nSuddenly, the master of Silver Mine appears to the cheers of his men. He heads the Alliance of Silver Pirates, whose aim is to capture all the pirates in the New World and pocket their bounties. Desire, who works for this organization, presents Bill with his prize, none other than Monkey D. Luffy. Bill is stunned by her capture and can\u0027t help but congratulate her. But Bill\u0027s objective is clear. He wants to dominate the world of piracy by eliminating all his rivals one by one, turning them into silver statues using Gutsu Gutsu no Mi, which transforms his body into a furnace capable of smelting all types of ore. This was the fate that awaited Luffy if Bartolomeo hadn\u0027t intervened by digging a passage to Bill\u0027s lair. He managed to deflect the Silver Pirate Alliance leader\u0027s projectiles, much to the latter\u0027s anger. The latter orders his men to put him out of action, and a fierce battle ensues between Bartolomeo and Bill\u0027s men. But he must also cross swords with Desire, who doesn\u0027t want him to be able to free his prisoner. Bill takes care of this problem himself, drawing two swords from his glowing chest that can melt any metal. Believing his last hour has come, Bartolomeo is ready to sacrifice himself to save Luffy. But Luffy has an idea to get them both out. Using the huge silver marble in which he is imprisoned, the Straw Hat rolls it towards his opponents, who flee at the sight. But the lack of chocolate has taken its toll on Luffy, who loses his strength. However, this doesn\u0027t stop him from finding a way out of Bill\u0027s lair with Bartolomeo. They are soon pursued by Desire, Bill and his men, who are determined to get their hands on them.\n\nOn Silver Mine, Luffy and Bartolomeo manage to lose their pursuers. The Straw Hat explains that Desire had given him a piece of chocolate and that it was thanks to this that he was able to move the huge silver marble where he was stuck. Bartolomeo reveals to his companion that he knows this pirate woman very well, as he and Desire come from the same island. But their respite is short-lived, as Desire has found their trail. Accompanied by her loyal lieutenants, the young woman is ready to capture them again. However, Luffy and Bartolomeo flee, hot on the heels of Desire, who bombards them relentlessly. Despite the recommendations of her companions, the female pirate continues to fire on the fugitives, causing the ground to crack beneath them. Luffy and Bartolomeo fall into a huge hole. They are soon joined by Desire, who is plunged into the void with her vehicle before the helpless eyes of her friends, who can do nothing to save her.\n\nAt the same time, in his lair, Bill is visited by Mr. Tanaka, who demands an accounting for the escape of the Straw Hat and his companion. Bill reassures him that it\u0027s just a hiccup and that they\u0027ll soon be back in his hands, while presenting him with a tribute he regularly pays to Mr. Tanaka\u0027s boss. Suddenly, Peseta receives a snail phone call and informs his boss that Luffy and Desire have fallen into a huge hole. Bill orders him to warn Abellon immediately so that he can catch them as soon as possible...",

        "description": "Bartolomeo, Desire and Luffy find themselves trapped in the underground Silver Mine. The Bartoclub leader is the first to come to his senses and searches desperately for his friend, whom he quickly finds. For her part, Desire discovers that her Battle Boat is totally unusable and that she can\u0027t communicate with the outside world with her mini snail phone. At the same time, a mysterious individual in the shape of a Wagon Man sets out to eliminate them. He soon arrives and tries to crush Luffy with his wagon. But Bartolomeo is there and pushes the Straw Hat aside before it can be knocked down. This minor setback doesn\u0027t deter Abellon, who returns to the charge and even pursues Desire, who is on his side and doesn\u0027t understand why she\u0027s being targeted too. Bartolomeo orders her to help him push Luffy\u0027s ball out of the way. However, Abellon continues to chase them, having pulled bombs out of a trapdoor and hurriedly thrown them at his prey. The latter are exposed to a downpour of bombs, forcing them to quicken their pace.\nWhile fleeing from Abellon, Luffy asks Bartolomeo to use his powers, but he can\u0027t do anything as long as his hands are glued together. Suddenly, a louder explosion sends Luffy\u0027s marble and all its occupants flying away, and the Straw Hat, along with Bartolomeo and Desire, roll onto the tracks, still pursued by Abellon, who continues to throw bombs at them. But the track the three fugitives are taking soon turns into a real roller-coaster ride. Vertiginous descents follow right-angle turns where the three pirates have to use their imagination to avoid death. Behind them, Abellon pursues them and throws his bombs. Suddenly, Luffy\u0027s group comes to a fork in the road and decides to take the right-hand lane to escape their pursuer. Unfortunately, the path they\u0027ve taken is a dead end, and Luffy and his companions realize only too late that they\u0027ve reached a dead end. This incident suits Abellon, who is still hot on their heels.\n\nUnable to stop to avoid the worst, the three fugitives smash the plank with the skull and crossbones on it and are hurled into the void before Abellon\u0027s delighted eyes. Abellon receives a snail phone call from Bill, who asks if his subordinate has found the three fugitives. Abellon replies that they are on the top level of the underground mine. His boss then orders him to make sure they are eliminated, an order Abellon follows to the letter.\n\nAt his headquarters, Bill is visited by Desire\u0027s three companions, who ask for his help in rescuing their friend, who has fallen into the underground mine along with Luffy and Bartolomeo. The leader of the Silver Pirate Alliance reassures them that he has sent a unit to look for Desire. At the same time, Luffy and his companions are safe and sound despite their dizzying fall, and realize that they are in a place from which they cannot escape. The Straw Hat is distressed at not being able to get out of his marble. Desire assures him that all Bill\u0027s creations are unbreakable: a revelation that annoys Bartolomeo, who starts bickering with the young woman. The latter calls Bartolomeo a traitor for breaking his promise to leave East Blue with her and become the world\u0027s greatest pirates. Desire then tells her story. One day, she set off with her own all-female crew. But they were surprised by a Navy ship that attacked them, leaving only a few survivors, including Desire and her three friends. The latter were rescued by Bill, who took them to Silver Mine, where they agreed to join the Silver Pirate Alliance. Desire finishes her story when a group of miners appear and ask them what they\u0027re doing there.\n\nThe three pirates are taken to the miners\u0027 village. The miners help Bartolomeo undo the glue that prevents him from activating his power, and reveal to a surprised Desire that they were once members of the Silver Pirate Alliance. But when they failed to honor Bill\u0027s demands by acquiring wealth and catching wanted pirates, they were sentenced to hard labor for life at the bottom of the underground Silver Mine. But Desire doesn\u0027t believe a word of it, as she\u0027s still loyal to Bill. Aware of who they were dealing with, the miners try to extract Luffy from his silver prison, but to no avail. Straw Hat asks the miners if there\u0027s a way out of this underground prison. His new allies tell him that there are rails that lead up to the surface, but using them would be dangerous, as Abellon would know and would come to eliminate any unwary escapees.\n\nSuddenly, an alarm sounds, announcing Abellon\u0027s arrival in the miners\u0027 village. As Bartolomeo tries to remove the glue from his hands, the Wagon Man spots Desire and throws a bomb at her, which the young woman narrowly avoids. For their part, the miners are helpless before Abellon\u0027s cruelty. Desire asks him if it\u0027s true that Bill wants to eliminate him too. Abellon replies that it is, and the blood runs cold in the pirate-woman\u0027s veins as she realizes that she\u0027s been fooled all along. Desire takes out her stick to deflect the bombs Abellon is throwing at her. One of them was aimed at Luffy and exploded just as Bartolomeo\u0027s hands were finally free. When the latter regains consciousness, he realizes to his horror that Luffy\u0027s marble has ended up on the rails. Abellon seized the opportunity to attack the Straw Hat once again, using his secret weapon: a drill forged especially for him by Bill, capable of piercing any material. Throwing himself at full speed onto the rails, Abellon managed to make a hole in Luffy\u0027s sphere, which cracked to the latter\u0027s delight. Before Bartolomeo\u0027s delighted eyes, the Straw Hat, unharmed by Abellon\u0027s attack, is freed and uses his powers to pay back his attacker. The latter is not to be trifled with, however, and uses every weapon at his disposal to eliminate the young pirate.\n\nThrowing bombs at him, Luffy manages to fire them back at Abellon, who is quickly defeated. Seeing that he couldn\u0027t defeat him completely, Abellon fled. Luffy sees this and tries to stop him. He is soon pursued by Bartolomeo, who wants to lend him a hand. Bartolomeo uses his powers to derail Abellon, who soon finds himself at the mercy of Luffy, who easily overcomes him. The miners, who witness the scene, are overwhelmed by the power of the Straw Hat. Luffy then asks them to accompany him to the surface to get out of the underground mine as quickly as possible.\n\nIn Bill\u0027s lair, Peseta informs him of Abalon\u0027s defeat. Undaunted, the leader of the Silver Pirate Alliance decides to take matters into his own hands and eliminate the three fugitives once and for all by burying them alive...",

        "description": "Luffy, Bartolomeo and Desire set out to reach the surface using the mine\u0027s railroads, despite the reluctance of the miners, who are afraid of facing the wrath of Bill and his second-in-command, the sinister Peseta. But Bartolomeo convinces them to go along, reassuring them that the Straw Hat is very powerful. For her part, Desire harangues the miners to follow her, as she has a score to settle with Bill, who betrayed her by sending Abellon to liquidate her. And it\u0027s with great enthusiasm that all the inhabitants of the mining village accompany Luffy and his companions to the surface. On the way, however, they come face to face with Peseta. Peseta orders his men to fire cannons at the troop led by the Straw Hat. This attack pulverizes the path taken by Luffy and his companions, who are all hurled into the void. But Luffy uses his powers to cushion the blow, and Bartolomeo takes over, creating a barrier to protect everyone from the bridge debris falling on them.\nSuddenly, they see Peseta above them, laughing at them. Desire questions him about his intentions and learns that Peseta has been sent by Bill to bury them all alive. However, Bartolomeo wants to thwart his plan and sends a section of his barrier loaded with debris at their assailants, who are surprised by the attack, except for Peseta. Peseta knows how dangerous the Bari Bari no Mi is, but another surprise awaits him. Before Luffy\u0027s astonished eyes, the Bartoclup leader changes his barrier into a huge staircase that pierces everything in its path to reach the surface. Luffy and his friends take the stairs to freedom, but Peseta won\u0027t let them. He orders his men to machine-gun the little group, knowing that Bartolomeo can only erect one barrier at a time, so he can\u0027t guarantee sufficient protection against his cannonballs. However, this inconvenience doesn\u0027t dampen the Straw Hat\u0027s enthusiasm, and he dashes up the steps, soon followed by Desire and the miners.\n\nJust as Luffy and his companions are about to reach the surface, a welcoming committee, sent by Peseta, waits for them, armed with sprays packed with incandescent metal, and opens fire. Just as the situation seemed lost, Trafalgar Law has one of the miners transferred to his [[Ope Ope no Mi[pouvoir]] by Kinemon, whose great fencing skills enable him to cut through the plasma jets with disconcerting ease. Luffy guesses that Going Luffy-senpai isn\u0027t far away, and that his friends had managed to track him down. Indeed, on the deck of the Straw Hat ship, Law is in sight of Silver Mine, leaving Luffy to take over. The latter takes great pleasure in destroying Peseta\u0027s minions with a masterful Elephant Gun that sends them flying through the air.\n\nAfter this feat, the Straw Hat, Bartolomeo, Desire and the miners are happy to be back in the sunshine, but they still have to face Peseta, who proves to be a tenacious enemy. He has one last card to play, and shows Desire that he holds her companions in his power. The young woman seems powerless when Peseta announces that he will kill them if Luffy and his friends resist him. However, his plan falls apart when Zoro intervenes and frees Desire\u0027s friends from their chains with his swords. Peseta is enraged by this turn of events and attacks the Straw Hat Crew swordsman with sticky balls, which Zoro slices with a single sword stroke, to the amazement of Bartolomeo and Kinemon. Using his great fencing skills, Zoro creates a tornado that sweeps Peseta and all his companions away.\n\nAfter witnessing this prodigy, Desire orders her friends to take the miners to the port and leave Silver Mine as soon as possible, while she stays on the island to settle matters with Bill. Before leaving, Desire apologizes to Luffy for her rudeness, as she had been mistaken about him all along. The Straw Hat thanks her for the gesture, then runs with Bartolomeo, Kinemon and Zoro to the Going Luffy-senpai moored nearby. As the pirates set off in the direction of their ship, they are attacked by Bill, who has sent them a large mass of glowing metal which destroys the bridge they had to cross to reach their ship. Zoro and Kinemon manage to cross it, but Luffy and Bartolomeo find themselves trapped on the other side before Desire\u0027s horrified eyes. The leader of the Alliance of Silver Pirates then appears and reveals his desire to appropriate Luffy and Zoro\u0027s bounties. But the Straw Hat gives him no such pleasure, ordering Zoro and Kinemon to join the Going Luffy-senpai as soon as possible, as their friends needed them. The swordsman and samurai obey the order, leaving Luffy, Bartolomeo and Desire to face Bill alone.\n\nAt the same time, the Straw Hat ship comes under surprise attack from members of the Alliance of Silver Pirates, who shoot them down with their Battle Boats. Franky is at his post, coordinating the defense of the ship with Bartolomeo\u0027s men, Ussop and Robin. But their attackers are too numerous and Law worries that Luffy isn\u0027t there yet. Nearby, Bill reveals his cunning to Desire, confessing that it was he who had wiped out her entire crew before deciding to save her from drowning. The pirate-woman can\u0027t suppress her anger at this admission, and tears begin to fall from her eyes as Bill looks on in disgust. Faced with this distressing spectacle, Luffy decides to help Desire take her revenge...",

        "description": "Bartolomeo, Desire and Luffy face Bill, who is determined to eliminate them. Before doing so, the leader of the Alliance of Silver Pirates reveals his true intention: to lead a pleasant and luxurious life by capturing the most wanted pirates and acquiring precious minerals that would enrich his personal fortune. Bill continues to disparage Desire\u0027s courage, pushing the young woman to her limits. Desire lunges at Bill to attack him, but is beaten to the punch by Luffy, who sends Bill crashing into a rock. But this attack doesn\u0027t seem to faze his adversary, who gets back up, furious. Desire is astonished that the Straw Hat should take his part. Bartolomeo convinces her to let Luffy fight instead, because he knows what he\u0027s doing.\nLuffy comes face to face with Bill and an explosive battle is about to begin. The leader of the Alliance of Silver Pirates draws two sabers from his glowing belly, forging them with his own power, then lunges at Luffy to kill him. But the latter remains impassive in the face of the threat, using his Haki to break the blades of his opponent, who is astonished to be fighting such a powerful pirate. However, this setback doesn\u0027t hinder Bill\u0027s plans, and he immediately goes back on the attack. He pulls out an axe and uses it to chop off the Straw Hat\u0027s head. But the latter is faster than him and knows how to parry his attacks. Luffy uses the Fluid again to kick Bill in the stomach, who drops his weapon in pain. Far from staying there, the Straw Hat uses the full power of Gomu Gomu no Mi to make him bite the dust before Desire\u0027s astonished eyes. Bill is on the verge of surrendering after this latest attack, when his men arrive in Battle Boats to meet him. On seeing them arrive, Desire tries to convince them that Bill had deceived them, but Bill manages to fool them by telling them that Desire had betrayed them by joining forces with the Straw Hat and his friends to destroy the Silver Pirate Alliance. Bill\u0027s ploy works perfectly, but Desire tries to defend himself by confessing that Bill\u0027s former companions, who were not up to his standards, had been locked away at the bottom of the underground Silver Mine, where they worked as slaves to extract ore. The members of the Silver Pirate Alliance don\u0027t know who to believe, and Bill takes advantage of the situation to order them to attack Luffy. For his part, Desire begs the Straw Hat not to harm his companions, for they know only too well that they have been deceived by their leader. The latter pulls out a huge cannon from his belly and prepares to fire it.\n\nHowever, Luffy doesn\u0027t give in and uses the Haki of Kings to light Bill\u0027s men on the spot. This astonishes Bill, who can\u0027t believe his eyes: Luffy really is a tough opponent. But this doesn\u0027t disarm the leader of the Silver Pirate Alliance, who fires at the Straw Hat. The latter instantly destroys the ball and chain he had sent him, before inflicting a stinging beating on his assailant who, under the violence of his attacks, is sent into the depths of Silver Mine! Desire is overwhelmed by Luffy\u0027s power when she sees this.\n\nAt the bottom of the mine, Bill is struggling to come to his senses when he receives a visit from Mr. Tanaka. Mr. Tanaka mocks him for having been beaten by a common pirate and predicts that the Shinsekai Monster will be very disappointed by his incompetence. However, Bill has a bad memory of his encounter with Mr. Tanaka\u0027s boss, who had brought himself and his crew to their knees with the power of money. Fearing abandonment, he tries to redeem himself by confessing to his emissary that all was not yet over. At his words, Bill begins to ingest an impressive quantity of coal, which immediately begins to melt on contact with his body. Mr. Tanaka takes his leave, believing that Bill knew what he was doing.\n\nAt the same time, on the surface, Bartolomeo, Desire and Luffy set off to join their companions. As they run towards the coast, they are followed by Bill\u0027s men, who try to get off the island any way they can as the ground begins to melt and lava flows threaten to engulf them. The Straw Hat and his friends are astonished to see such a prodigy. Meanwhile, the occupants of the Going Luffy-senpai come under renewed attack from Bill\u0027s fleet, which is routed by Franky\u0027s firepower. But their enemies are numerous and they owe their salvation to Zoro, who uses his fencing skills to disperse the last attackers. Trafalgar Law notices that Luffy was not with them. Kinemon and Zoro explain that he will join them later, as he had urgent matters to attend to. Suddenly, near their boat, the ground begins to melt, which startles Ussop.\n\nNot far away, Luffy and his two companions spotted a strange man in the distance who was the source of the lava flows. It was Bill, whose appearance had changed dramatically. By consuming so much ore, his body had grown and a demonic look now adorned his face. The leader of the Alliance of Silver Pirates stepped forward, announcing that there was no way out, even if it meant melting the whole island with him. Bartolomeo tries to slow him down with his power, but to no avail. He, Luffy and Desire are soon surrounded by a flood of lava that threatens to wipe them out. Suddenly, following an attack by Bill, Desire falls into an abyss. She owes her life to Bartolomeo, who is determined to preserve his friendship with her.\n\nAfter saving her, Bartolomeo takes it upon himself to save Luffy\u0027s life, which was threatened by Bill. On the advice of the Straw Hat, the leader of the Barto Club uses his power to overthrow Bill, who is swallowed up by waves of lava. This new defeat increases Bill\u0027s anger. Desperate to ruin Luffy\u0027s dreams, he unleashes an apocalypse across Silver Mine. Sending jets of lava into the sky, he creates a fireball which he sends against the Straw Hat. The latter counters with the \u0022Grizzly Magnum\u0022, knocking out the leader of the Silver Pirate Alliance once and for all. Bartolomeo is ecstatic to see his idol emerge victorious.\n\nHowever, Bill\u0027s defeat does nothing to change the situation on Siver Mine. The island continued to melt, and its inhabitants began to flee. In fact, all the members who were in Bill\u0027s pay rejoined their only ship and tried to take on board the last stragglers. Soon, they notice Desire\u0027s absence and begin to worry about her. The same fear grips the crew of the \u0022Going Luffy-senpai\u0022, but is quickly dispelled when Zoro shows Luffy\u0027s Life Card moving. Joy soon replaces fear when Robin and his friends spot Luffy and Bartolomeo in the distance aboard Desire\u0027s Battle Boat, which is rapidly moving away from Silver Mine, now a glowing heap of ore. Inside the island, torrents of lava destroy everything in their path, including Bill\u0027s throne room and the old miners\u0027 village. Soon, Silver Mine Island is a shadow of its former self, sinking into the depths of the sea.\n\nAfter this frightening spectacle, the joy of reunion is felt and Desire can\u0027t help thanking her saviors. Bartolomeo takes advantage of the situation to ask Desire and her companions to join the Barto Club, but the pirate-woman politely declines his invitation, making it clear that she has her own road to travel. Reluctantly accepting her decision, Bartolomeo sees his friend off to new horizons, while Going Luffy-senpai sails off to Zou in good spirits.\n\nSomewhere in the New World, a Revolutionary Army ship led by Koala is in sight of Gran Tesoro, a casino ship where strange things are happening. Mr. Tanaka reports to his master that Silver Mine has gone down with Bill. This little inconvenience doesn\u0027t disturb Gildo Tesoro\u0027s plans, who has other projects in mind...",

        "description": "The Straw Hats and their allies set sail for Zou, crossing the most dangerous seas in the New World aboard the Going Luffy-senpai. Bartolomeo takes the opportunity to tell his men the story of each member of the Straw Hat Crew. He begins with Luffy, explaining to his fellow passengers how the young pirate had been saved in extremis by Shanks after having to sacrifice his arm in a battle with a sea monster in Fuschia, twelve years earlier. He goes on to recount Luffy\u0027s meeting with Zoro, who was a prisoner of Colonel Morgan. He goes on to recount Luffy\u0027s meeting with Nami, who was battling Baggy the Clown before facing the terrifying Arlong Fishman. Bartolomeo then recounted Ussop\u0027s arrival in Luffy\u0027s crew after defeating the notoriously manipulative Captain Kuro, then Luffy\u0027s meeting with Sanji after he saved the Baratie from the destructive madness of Don Krieg. He continues the story of the Straw Hat Crew by explaining Luffy\u0027s encounter with the reindeer Tony Tony Chopper, who was fighting the infamous Wapol on Drum Island.\nBartolomeo raves about the adventures of the Straw Hats and has to confess to his men that, before Nico Robin and Franky became an integral part of the Straw Hat Crew, they were Luffy\u0027s enemies at first. However, as they grew to know the young pirate, they eventually became his most loyal friends. The same was true of Brook, the living skeleton the crew met wandering alone on his ship in the Florian Triangle. Bartolomeo and his men are so moved that floods of tears cover the entire deck of their ship. But a violent bolt of lightning strikes them as they set sail for Zou.\n\nMeanwhile, back at naval headquarters, Admiral Kizaru hears from one of his subordinates that the Whitebeard pirates, led by a certain A.O., have been wiped out by Edward Weeble, the self-proclaimed son of Edward Newgate. Although his affiliation with this legendary pirate is debatable, his power is very real, and it\u0027s for this reason that he\u0027s gone on the hunt for all of Whitebeard\u0027s surviving allies. These two close friends of Edward Newgate have received news of Doflamingo\u0027s defeat at Dressrosa and believe that Luffy must know the whereabouts of Marco, who had protected Garp\u0027s grandson during the Battle of Marineford.\n\nA week after leaving Dressrosa, the Going Luffy-senpai, whose crew is seasick, comes in sight of a strange island that is carried on the back of a gigantic elephant. Trafalgar D. Water Law explains that Zou is a ghost island that is never in the same place on the sea, as it is constantly on the move like a fugitive island. Luffy and his friends prepare to land there, thinking that Nami and the rest of their companions are already there thanks to the Life Card they left them. However, they have to face the hostile Minkmens tribe, who hate humans and have been isolated from the rest of the world for over a thousand years...",

        "description": "The Going Luffy-senpai finally arrives in sight of Zou, which is in fact a gigantic elephant carrying an island on its back! His passengers are delighted to find Sunny attached to the huge pachyderm\u0027s hind leg with a chain. Luffy calls his friends, but to no avail. He goes back to his ship to find out and discovers that there\u0027s no one left on board. Suddenly, the Thousand Sunny begins to shake dangerously, as Zou had accelerated his pace for no apparent reason. This doesn\u0027t faze Luffy, who is amused by the elephant\u0027s reaction, as it emits muffled grunts as it makes its way through the sea. But the Sunny suddenly picks up speed and is soon beyond the reach of the Going Luffy-senpai. Bartolomeo orders his men to follow the Straw Hat ship as closely as possible, while he uses his power to create a bridge to link the two boats together. Soon, the elephant stops running and the Barto Club boss can finally catch his breath to find that all his guests have already boarded the Thousand Sunny to meet Luffy. Trafalgar Law asks him if he\u0027s found his friends and thinks they\u0027ve probably landed on the island. Luffy decides to join them.\nMeanwhile, in Bartigo, the headquarters of the revolutionary army, Monkey D. Dragon, Luffy\u0027s father, takes in the news from Dressrosa and learns of the fall of the Donquichotte Family, while Koala, as a good subordinate, reports to him that the weapons, which she had managed to steal from Dressrosa with the help of Hack and Sabo, were made from a very rare steel called Metalsake. Dragon orders her to gather all the leaders of the revolutionary army. At the same time, Jesus Burgess, exhausted after his defeat by Sabo, telephones Laffitte and Shiliew, sailing with Blackbeard\u0027s fleet somewhere in the New World seas, to report that he has found the base of the revolutionary army. Not far away, on an island, Edward Weeble, Whitebeard\u0027s self-proclaimed son, seeks confirmation of his filiation with the great pirate from his mother, Miss Bakkin, who had put it into her head to track down all of Whitebeard\u0027s living allies. These two relatives of Edward Newgate have received news through the press of Doflamingo\u0027s defeat at Dressrosa and think that Luffy must know where Marco is, having protected Garp\u0027s grandson during the great battle atop Marineford.\n\nAt the same time, in Kalai Bali, Baggy and his crew celebrate the end of Doflamingo\u0027s arms trade with a huge banquet. Baggy\u0027s mood darkens, however, when he hears from Morge that Hajrudin and four other Giants have left their crew. Back to Zou. Luffy and his friends prepare to explore the island. For his part, Bartolomeo bids farewell to his idols, leaving them some food and hoping to see them again very soon, having proved himself and his crew worthy subordinates of the Straw Hats.\n\nTo find Luffy\u0027s friends, Kanjuro uses his powers to draw a dragon, enabling them to climb one of the huge elephant\u0027s legs. The Straw Hat and his companions begin their ascent by climbing up Zou\u0027s left hind leg with their strange mount. Below, Bartolomeo and his crew watch the scene and can\u0027t help but burst out in delight. Luffy notices them and shouts Bartolomeo\u0027s name to thank him for bringing them to their destination. This recognition goes straight to the heart of the Barto Club\u0027s leader, who, overwhelmed by emotion, cries his eyes out. He orders his men to leave Zou, while Luffy and his friends continue to climb to the top of the ghost island...",

        "description": "At Zou, Luffy and his companions climb the elephant\u0027s left hind leg on the back of the dragon drawn by Kanjuro. Despite a dizzying fall that forced them to return to their starting point, the small group climbed Zou\u0027s leg again with the help of Ryuunosuke, who, encouraged, climbed step by step up the enormous slope to the top.\nKnowing that they could now trust their new allies, Kinemon and Kanjuro informed them that Zou had been their final destination since leaving the Land of Wa, and that they had to go there to find Raizou, a ninja friend they had lost contact with, and to find out if he was all right. Suddenly, as they continue towards the summit, something rushes towards them at full speed. Trafalgar Law and the Straw Hats managed to dodge the strange creature that had attacked them, but Kinemon and Kanjuro failed to see it and fell from the dragon with a dizzying plunge. The two samurai are unharmed, however, and find themselves at the very bottom of Zou\u0027s paw. Kinemon orders Luffy to continue their ascent in any case, and that they\u0027ll join them later.\n\nDeprived of their allies from the Land of Wa, Luffy and his friends are about to reach Zou\u0027s hindquarters safely as the sun begins to set. But Luffy, who had been sleeping, wakes up with a start when he learns that they are close to the summit. Excited by this news, he leaned back and was on the verge of falling into the void if Usopp hadn\u0027t had the reflex to grab hold of him. Unfortunately, the Straw Hat Crew sniper had only managed to grab Luffy\u0027s bag. The latter took a dizzying fall and owed his salvation to the powers of his Demon Fruit, throwing his arms at Ryuunosuke\u0027s horns. Ryuunosuke, unbalanced, loses his grip on Zou\u0027s leg and risks falling too. But encouraged by his new friends, he manages to get back on his feet and sprint to the top, much to everyone\u0027s delight. At the end of the day, the dragon drawn by Kanjuro has completed his mission with difficulty and, to the tears of his new friends, he becomes a drawing again.\n\nAfter mourning Ryuunosuke\u0027s loss for a long time, Luffy spots a derelict watchtower and climbs up it using his elastic arms. He is soon joined by Usopp, who also wants to enjoy the view. The two pirates discover an extraordinary city, perched on the back of the huge elephant, with a tree at its center whose trunk resembles a strange carved whale. For their part, Zoro and Law notice that the huge gateway to the city has recently been ripped off, and that strange footsteps have left deep marks in the elephant\u0027s thick skin. They begin to explore, unaware that one of the island\u0027s inhabitants is watching them. Far ahead of them, Luffy has reached the town and discovers that it is completely in ruins. He searches for his missing friends, but can\u0027t find a soul around. Franky makes the same observation, detecting a faint smell of gunpowder or gas in the atmosphere. Just when they thought the city was completely deserted, they are attacked by a huge crocodile, devastating everything in its path, and by a small group of Minkmen, one of whom is wearing Nami\u0027s clothes...",

        "description": "In the ruined city overgrown with vegetation, Luffy searches desperately for his friends, but there\u0027s not a soul to be found. Undaunted, he continues his investigations and decides to climb the Whale Tree to get a better view of the island. As he tries to make the climb, he is spotted by a Mink. For his part, Carrot had to interrupt his fight with Zoro because of his friend Wanda. The Swordsman of the Straw Hat Crew had noticed that his opponent could generate electricity to attack him. He then witnesses the conversation between the two Minks and learns from Wanda that an invader had dared to enter the Whale Forest.\nNot far away, Luffy has given up on the idea of climbing the huge Whale Tree and must now face two huge hostile individuals who have come to meet him. At the same time, Luffy\u0027s friends witness a prodigy. After Carrot is informed of the intrusion on Zou\u0027s island, the Rabbit Mink takes an incredible leap that sends her soaring into the sky. From there, she has a bird\u0027s-eye view of the whole island. She was startled to see that a battle had begun. She reports everything she has seen to Wanda below, before quickly rejoining her comrade on the back of her domesticated crocodile mount. Before leaving, Wanda reveals to Zoro\u0027s team that the rest of the Straw Hats lie lifeless to the right of the forest\u0027s belly.\n\nGripped by a violent attack of sadness, Usopp cries his eyes out as he imagines Nami and his comrades dead, but his companions do all they can to comfort him. Suddenly, Robin asks Trafalgar Law if it\u0027s true that Bepo, his navigator, came from Zou. The former Shichibukai tells him that this information is correct, and reveals that he possesses a Life Card given to him by Bepo, which will help him to find him and the rest of his crew stationed on the island. They all set off, while Luffy has to face the Guardians of Zou, Rody, a mink-bull, and Black Back, a mink-gorilla, in the Whale Forest, who are astonished to see the young pirate unaffected by the electric shocks they throw at him thanks to his rubber body. Suddenly, Bepo and a few members of the Heart crew appear to break up the fight, but Rody\u0027s anger is far too great to be stopped. The mink-taurus charges at Luffy but is stopped by Carrot, who holds out a red blindfold to lure him in, while Wanda arrives to give Black Back some bananas to calm him down.\n\nLuffy is astonished to see so many Minks around him, watching him even though he can\u0027t feel their presence. Wanda explains that she knows who he is and that the guardians are there to watch over the forest and protect it from any intruders. Just as everything is getting back to normal, the members of the Heart Crew sympathize with Luffy, having learned from the newspapers that they are now allies of the Straw Hat Crew, and that their captain arrived on the island at the same time as Luffy.\n\nMeanwhile, in the city of Kurau, at the center of the elephant\u0027s back, Robin and his friends discover that the city had recently been destroyed. Franky and Zoro explore every nook and cranny and notice the footprints of a huge animal, while Robin, using her archaeological skills, asserts that the disaster had taken place one or two weeks ago, precisely when Sanji\u0027s group had set foot on Zou. For his part, Luffy learns from Wanda that the destruction of the Duchy of Mokomo, where he is, was caused by Jack. Suddenly, a terrible tremor shakes the whole island, and the crew of the Heart flee in the face of an impending Rainstorm. Luffy, who doesn\u0027t know what it\u0027s all about, is invited by Wanda to climb on her crocodile to find his friends, who have taken refuge in the Whale Forest. Le Chapeau de Paille is only too happy to find his comrades, but when he asks Wanda if they\u0027re all there, the mink-chienne remains stubbornly silent, as if trying to hide a secret from Luffy...",

        "description": "The ground of Zou begins to tremble dangerously as the Rainy Eruption threatens to engulf the entire island. While the members of the Heart Crew, led by Bepo, take cover by climbing trees, Luffy joins Wanda and Carrot on Crocky\u0027s back to head for the Whale Forest, where the Straw Hat\u0027s companions are staying. Meanwhile, in the city of Kurau, Zoro and his friends are also feeling the tremors that are shaking the island. Suddenly, Luffy sees a strange mound rise into the sky, pouring gallons of water over the island. The crocodile carrying Chapeau de Paille, Carrot and Wanda picks up the pace, while Zoro\u0027s team, aware of the danger, climbs to higher ground to avoid being swallowed up by the waves. Elsewhere, a huge wave pours in and Luffy, Wanda and Carrot are quickly submerged. The two Minks hang on to the crocodile, but Luffy is swept away by the current and, helpless, is about to be devoured by a passing shark. But Wanda orders Carrot to rescue the Straw Hat, who is saved in extremis and thanks Carrot for his gesture.\nMeanwhile, Kanjuro, Kinemon and Bariete, the little monkey who had attacked them, climb up the left leg of the huge pachyderm on the back of Nekozaemon, a cat hastily drawn by Kanjuro using his power. But they are surprised by a torrent resulting from the Rainy Eruption, which engulfs Nekozaemon while pushing the two samurai down. At the same time, in the forest which, like the whole town, is flooded, Wanda explains to Luffy that the Rainy Eruption is a daily event: Zunesha sprays herself with seawater twice a day to refresh herself, and the consequences of this \u0022miraculous rain\u0022 are beneficial as it provides an inexhaustible supply of water and fish for the Minks, thanks to a clever system of aqueducts that makes the water drinkable.\n\nEn route to the Right Flank Forest, Luffy spots Bepo, who asks him to warn Law of his crew\u0027s presence and bring him to them. The Straw Hat promises to do so. At the same time, in the ruins of the city of Kurau, Robin and her friends have managed to take refuge on the heights to escape the flood. The young archaeologist discovers that it was seawater that had submerged them and deduces that it was the elephant himself who was spraying himself to cool off. She also notes that the town and forest are adapted to such conditions, and believes that the islanders have long been accustomed to the mood swings of the enormous pachyderm. Suddenly, Ussop warns his friends that he has spotted Luffy on the edge of town. Through his magnifying glasses, he sees the Straw Hat on the crocodile\u0027s back with Carrot and Wanda. He screams in terror when he sees Luffy being bitten by the Mink-Rabbit. The Straw Hat Crew sniper thinks she\u0027s eating his friend, and believes Robin\u0027s assumption that the Minks are a cannibalistic tribe. In reality, Carrot was only biting Luffy out of pure affection, under Wanda\u0027s tender eyes.\n\nAs they make their way along the river, Wanda looks at the instruments of torture dotting the city and remembers the destruction of Zou a few days before. She can\u0027t help crying at the thought of the calamity that had befallen her island, while Carrot remains silent. Luffy does the same, but after getting out of the river, he asks Wanda who Jack is. She replied that Jack was a pirate who had dared to attack several Navy ships despite the presence on board of Issho and Sengoku, and that he had managed to color two of them in order to free Doflamingo, just after sacking Zou. According to the papers, Jack died following the assault, but Wanda believes he\u0027s still alive and that she\u0027ll never forgive him for having dared to destroy her country.\n\nApproaching their destination, Crocky quickens his pace to reach the place where Wanda wants to take Luffy, when the group led by Law appears before them, having arrived here thanks to the \u0022Shambles\u0022 technique. Usopp thinks the Minks are hostile and pretends to be Zoro, standing behind him, imitating his voice and threatening the Minks with his swords. This attempt is to no avail, as Wanda informs them that it\u0027s all a misunderstanding before showing them the Minks tribe\u0027s hideout: behind them are two guardians of the Whale Forest. They guard the entrance to a huge gate that leads to an impregnable fortress. Inside, in a chamber, Chopper runs to warn Nami, who was sleeping peacefully in the thick fleece of a giant ram, that Luffy and his friends have finally arrived. Outside, Wanda tells the other Minks that they are the Straw Hats. At the mention of this name, immense joy spreads, and the pirates are welcomed as heroes by the entire Minkmen tribe. They find Nami and Chopper in good health, but the joy soon gives way to disappointment when the young sailor, in tears, asks her captain to forgive her for what happened to Sanji...",

        "description": "After suffering the effects of the Rainy Eruption, which seriously damaged their mount, Kanjuro and Kinemon, accompanied by Bariete, survived the flood. Watching the sun set, they decide to spend the night at Sunny, before attempting another ascent of Zunesha\u0027s left paw the following morning. Meanwhile, in Zou\u0027s Right Belly Fortress, the party was in full swing to celebrate the arrival of Luffy and the Straw Hats. A banquet had been specially prepared in their honor by the Minks. Everyone is having fun and feasting. Nami and Chopper are delighted to have found their friends, but their joy is short-lived. Without warning, Brook appears, her clothes torn, and asks Luffy to forgive her for failing to save Sanji, as the young sailor had done earlier. The Straw Hat, who doesn\u0027t understand what\u0027s happening, asks about Momonosuke. Brook informs him that he has stayed in his room because he hates the company of the Minks. This comes as a great surprise to Luffy, who finds his hosts very friendly indeed. The living skeleton asks his captain if he can speak privately with him and the rest of the crew. Brook is relieved to learn that Kinemon is not present with his friends, but will come later with Kanjuro. He tells them to avoid uttering the words \u0022Samurai\u0022 and \u0022Land of Wa\u0022 in the presence of the Minks, as they might take them the wrong way.\nSuddenly, a group of canine Minks discover Brook and attack him, devouring him out of sheer affection. His companions leave him to his fate, returning to their duties, while Chopper asks his captain where Trafalgar Law is. Luffy, then Robin, replies that he has gone to find all the members of his crew who have taken refuge in the forest, with the help of the Life Card given to him by Bepo. At this point, Nami shows her impatience by asking to do something to find Sanji. Faced with her friends\u0027 incredulity, Robin asked Nami to explain what had happened since her group had left Dressrosa 11 days earlier aboard the Thousand Sunny. The young woman complies and begins her story.\n\nThey were on the coast of Dressrosa when they came across the huge Singing Ship of Big Mom\u0027s Crew, led by Tamago, Pekoms and Capone Bege, a Rookie of the Worst Generation visibly allied with Charlotte Linlin. They wanted to sink the Sunny and capture Caesar Clown. Sanji was ordered by Luffy to counterattack, and he did so in a rather original way: Brook slowed down the cannonballs while Chopper, who had taken on the appearance of the Monster Point, used Caesar\u0027s gaseous body as a bag to store the cannonballs before throwing them to Sanji, who, using the Sky Walk, ignited his feet to deliver a violent blow to Caesar, causing the flaming cannonballs to fall on the Singing Ship. The right side of the ship\u0027s hull is damaged, and Sanji manages to save Caesar Clown\u0027s life before he hits the water. The Singing Ship, though in bad shape, could sink at any moment. Now it\u0027s Nami\u0027s turn to use her talents to lose their pursuers, using Cloud Rain to create a thick cloud that leaves their opponents stunned.\n\nThe young navigator\u0027s prowess is greeted by cheers from all present, but Robin wants her friend to continue her story and asks when they reached Zou. Nami replies that it was the following day, and that this date does not coincide entirely with the destruction of the island which, according to Robin, had taken place two weeks earlier. This information is confirmed by Wanda, who praises the courage and talents of Nami\u0027s group while recalling the destruction of her country. She wants to tell her new friends, but a Mink informs her that Duke Inuarashi has just woken up. This news lifts Wanda\u0027s spirits, as it does Chopper\u0027s, who sets off to check on his patient\u0027s health in the company of Tristan and Miyagi, two Minks he has acquired in his service. Wanda invites Luffy and his friends to come and see the Duke too. The Straw Hat asks her who Inuarashi is. His host explains that Inuarashi is the duke who rules the Principality of Momoko. He had been in a coma since the town was sacked by Jack at the same time as Duke Nekomamushi. Wanda explains to him that these two dukes together direct Zou\u0027s destiny, one by day and the other by night...",

On the way, Luffy stops to eat some giant grapes and tells his companions how much he loves this place. Wanda is pleased to hear him say this, before pointing out that the capital of the Momoko duchy is the city of Kurau, which is now totally destroyed. Yet she remembers its lively, cheerful streets and the carefree spirit of its inhabitants before the arrival of Jack and his men seventeen days earlier. Their arrival had been heralded by the alarm bell rung by Bariete, and the huge gate that closed the access to the principality had been forced open by a monstrous being in the shape of a mammoth. It was Jack who was terrorizing the inhabitants using the powers of his Demon Fruit. While his men were ransacking the forest to reach the city of Kurau, Zunesha was barracking, sensing the unusual movements affecting Zou.\nAfter gathering all the inhabitants in front of him, Jack, still in his mammoth form, ordered them to hand over a ninja from the Land of Wa named Raizou. However, they were unaware of this man\u0027s presence on their island, and their ignorance annoyed Jack. It was at this point that Sheephead, leader of the Gifters, intervened and introduced his acolytes: Jack, one of the three calamities of the Kaido Crew, and Gin Rummy. Sheephead orders the Minkmen to hand over Raizou, or their country will be totally ravaged. But the Minkmen keep telling him they don\u0027t know the man. Monjii, the wisest of all the Minkmen, arrives and informs Jack that there are no ninja on his island. This answer doesn\u0027t satisfy Jack, who begins to destroy the city before the helpless eyes of its inhabitants. His men watch the spectacle, mocking the Minkmen, while Jack continues to demand that Raizou be brought to him immediately.\n\nBack to the present. Luffy is astonished by the presence of a mammoth on Zou, even though he doesn\u0027t know it\u0027s the form the Demon Fruit Jack ate can take. Jack orders his Pleasures to comb Zou for the ninja. His men obey his order and begin attacking the inhabitants. However, the latter put up resistance by using their main weapon, Electro, which strikes their enemies dead on the spot. This turn of events angers Jack, but Monjii tries to soften his blow by suggesting a discussion with the duke who rules the country. Jack refuses and calls in his Gifters, a terrifying group of Demon Fruit eaters. They are ordered by Sheephead to destroy the kingdom in order to find Raizou. With the situation worsening, the Minks had no choice but to fight back. A full-fledged confrontation ensued between the Minkmen and the pirates, who completely destroyed the beautiful city of Kurau, which had become a veritable battlefield. The survivors of this slaughter found refuge in the well-defended fortress of Flanc Droit.\n\nWanda had finished her story while her guests were crossing a suspension bridge. Luffy noticed this, and began to move the bridge under the wrathful gaze of his companions, who didn\u0027t appreciate his childishness. After this incident, Wanda announces that they will soon arrive at the clinic where the Duke is being treated. After listening carefully to her story, Brook understands why the words \u0022Samurai\u0022 and \u0022Land of Wa\u0022 were taboo in Zou, as they brought back too many bad memories to its inhabitants. But as they walked towards Duke Inuarashi\u0027s sanatorium, Luffy inadvertently dared to utter the word \u0022Ninja\u0022 in front of his friends and Wanda, who found it rather suspicious...",

        "description": "Luffy, who had uttered the word \u0022ninja\u0022 supposedly to offend the Minks, is quickly brought to his senses by Brook, Nami and Usopp. Wanda looks serious and questions the Straw Hat about what he\u0027d just said, and Brook saves the day by saying he\u0027d said \u0022kanja\u0022, meaning patient in Japanese. Wanda then tells them they\u0027re being kind, and they finally arrive at the sanatorium where Duke Inuarashi is being treated. At the entrance to the clinic, they meet Sicilian, a Mink-lion captain of the Musketeer Squad, who is reprimanding other Minks. Wanda questions him, and he replies that these Minks had dared to utter such nonsense as love and kindness in her presence. The Minks who had fallen victim to his wrath thought he was doing it for their own good and complimented him, which Sicilian found even more irritating. Wanda then tells him that she\u0027s with the Straw Hats, and Sicilian rushes over to them, bows and calls them saviors before hugging Luffy tightly, at the risk of choking him.\nThe pirates then enter the sanatorium with Sicilian and see for the first time Inuarashi, a huge Mink-dog, the duke who rules Zou by day, being treated by Miyagi and Tristan under the guidance of Chopper, who directs all medical operations. Wanda hugs Inuarashi, as she was very worried about him. The Duke appreciates her gesture and notices the presence of the members of the Straw Hat Crew. He thanks them for all they\u0027ve done for Zou, then meets Luffy, who\u0027s not yet up to speed on the island\u0027s history. However, the Duke begins to drool as he catches sight of Brook\u0027s skeletal body, which makes him terribly envious. Inuarashi then notices Luffy\u0027s straw hat and explains that, back when he sailed with Nekomamushi, a Mink-chat, their captain, Shanks wore the same. Luffy is very surprised that Inuarashi should know Shanks, but is disappointed when he sees the duke suddenly fall asleep before his eyes, with his doctors. Luffy tries to wake him up, but to no avail. Wanda explains how the duchy works: there are two dukes, Inuarashi, who is active during the day, and Nekomamushi at night. These two Minks run Zou at the same time, and Inuarashi\u0027s active period is from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., with Nekomamushi taking over immediately afterwards. She also explains that they don\u0027t work together because they hate each other and are ready to kill each other as soon as they see each other. Even Sicilian, for all his bravery, is affected by the separation between day and night, and eventually succumbs to sleep. Seeing the Musketeers\u0027 leader asleep, Wanda adds that this system had also worked during their war against Kaido\u0027s Crew, which she narrates once again.\n\nWhile Jack wreaks havoc on the houses of Kurau with his trunk, the Gifters assault the inhabitants in their quest for Raizou. The confrontation between the pirates and the Minks turns deadly, as the latter - including Carrot and Wanda, who took part in the fighting - are powerless against Jack, who has taken on the shape of a gigantic mammoth thanks to the power of his Demon Fruit. The Musketeer Squad, including Sicilian, then arrived and quickly defeated the most powerful Gifters. But the leader of the Musketeers was no match for Jack\u0027s power and quickly bit the dust. Just then, Duke Inuarashi appears, riding his pet crocodile, and puts a smile on the faces of all his subjects. He confronts Jack, who realizes he\u0027s dealing with the ruler of the country...",

Just when all seemed lost, Duke Inuarashi appears, riding his pet crocodile, and confronts Jack, who understands that he is the ruler of the country. As the latter orders his men to sack the city of Kurau, provoking the Minks to fight to the death to protect their homeland, Inuarashi stops hostilities and voluntarily drops his sword to let Jack know that he is not seeking confrontation. He doesn\u0027t want to resist, and lets Jack search everywhere for Raizou on condition that he stops ravaging the country immediately. But Jack refuses his proposal and strikes a blow with his trunk at the Duke, who, to everyone\u0027s surprise, stops him with his arm. One of Jack\u0027s subordinates reveals his captain\u0027s bounty to the Minks to impress them: a billion berrys. Jack decides to wreak havoc until he finds Raizou, and the confrontation continues between the Minks (especially the Musketeer squad) and Kaido\u0027s crew. Some of the Gifters used a technique called \u0022Hyena Grip\u0022, in which their arm was transformed into a ravenous hyena to injure as many Minks as possible. Inuarashi, who had taken up his sword, attacked Jack using Electro, which weakened his opponent, but the latter stood up as if the Duke\u0027s electric shock had had no effect on him. Mad with rage, Jack launches an assault on his enemies, ready to destroy the entire City of Kurau in order to wipe them out. In the face of such danger, Inuarashi once again stops him, administering an electric shock stronger than the pre-cende, which seems to stop him.\nIn the present, Ussop and Luffy are stunned by Duke Inuarashi\u0027s fencing skills while he, like Sicilian, is fast asleep. Zoro asked Wanda about the fight between the Minks and the pirates. The Mink-dog explained to the Straw Hats that it had intensified when Jack confronted Inuarashi, attacking him with his trunk. The duke managed to parry his blows with his sword and launch a third electric shock, which again had no effect on him. In a rage, Jack hit Inuarashi full force and threw him against the wall of a house. The Duke escaped unscathed, however, and continued his duel with the pirate leader while the three musketeers confronted the three \u0022Gifters Grip\u0022. Sicilian single-handedly defeated them. Suddenly, a rainstorm swept across the country, temporarily routing Kaido\u0027s pirates. The latter resumed the fight, becoming increasingly ferocious. But when 6:00 p.m. arrived, Inuarashi signaled to his musketeers to stop fighting and go to sleep, leaving the way clear for the master of the night, Nekomamushi, a Mink-chat, and the Guardians of Zou. Arriving in the devastated city, Nekomamushi understood the situation and attacked Jack directly, using a technique that knocked his opponent to the ground before the astonished eyes of his men. Nekomamushi warned Jack that he would not let any samurai (speaking of Raizou) enter Momoko\u0027s Principality. The latter then transformed into a human and the Duke concluded that he had eaten the Zo Zo no Mi, model: Mammoth. Before a new battle could begin, the Heart Crew arrived. Bepo offered Nekomamushi his help in defending Zou against the invaders. The Twilight King agreed, and the battle between the Minks and Jack\u0027s men resumed with unprecedented violence...",

        "description": "While Duke Inuarashi and his faithful Sicilian, the captain of his personal guard, slept soundly, Wanda continued her tale and explained to the Straw Hats that the battle between Nekomamushi and the Guardians of Zou and Jack and his men lasted five days. It was a bitter and difficult battle that left the city of Kurau bled dry and in ruins. Jack and Nekomamushi were outstanding fighters, and their confrontation lasted for hours. When morning came, Nekomamushi bowed out to make way for Inuarashi, who continued his fight against Jack after noticing that the latter had taken on human form. The Duke of Momoko was astonished to see his adversary still on his feet, determined to destroy his country to find a samurai. While the Musketeer Squad neutralized the Gifters, Inuarashi took personal charge of Jack, and the two went head-to-head in single combat. The Mink-dog\u0027s strength was equivalent to that of the Mink-cat, and Jack found it difficult to defeat his enemy. Wanda explained to Luffy and his friends that, in order to defeat the pirates, the Mink tribe had had to alternate their fighters day and night, continuing the battle for almost five days. But it was an unequal battle, as Jack had many reinforcements coming in from the sea, and the Minks had great difficulty in repelling them. Yet, despite this difficulty, the Minks were on the verge of winning the battle and managed to defeat everyone except Jack. On the fifth day, Jack pulled out his last trump card and used a poison gas weapon invented by Caesar Clown. The gas spread rapidly throughout the town and part of the forest, killing hundreds of people.\nJack\u0027s men, wearing suits to avoid being asphyxiated, crucified and tortured all the surviving Minks warriors, including Duke Inuarashi and Nekomamushi, to find out where Raizou, the ninja from the Land of Wa, was. When they got no answer, and after learning of Doflamingo\u0027s defeat by the Straw Hat Crew at Dressrosa, Jack left Zou on the sixth day, leaving a dozen of his men behind. A week later, just as Luffy\u0027s companions arrived on the island, Inuarashi and Nekomamushi learned from the newspapers of Jack\u0027s death after he had attempted to rescue Doflamingo from the hands of the Navy.\n\nFor his part, Chopper explained to his friends that he and his team had arrived in Zou the day after Jack\u0027s departure. Sanji and his comrades couldn\u0027t believe their eyes when they saw the huge elephant supporting the island. They forced Caesar Clown to use his vaporous body as a hot-air balloon to reach the top of the island, where they began exploring before parting ways. Nami, in the company of Brook and Momonosuke, met Tristan, a Mink-squirrel, who was being chased by Sheephead and Gin Rummy, who were riding a huge alligator. The navigator of the Crew of the Straw Hat offered her help to save her new friend, who was very surprised to discover such characters. Brook easily overpowered Tristan\u0027s attackers using one of her most powerful fencing techniques. Seeing that she was dealing with powerful pirates, Tristan took fright. Nami tried to catch up with her, but she had already fled through the forest. At the same time, Sanji, C\u00e9sar and Chopper discovered the ruined city of Kurau and its gassed inhabitants. Covering their noses to avoid succumbing to the asphyxiating gas, Sanji and Chopper noticed that there were survivors. Pedro, one of the island\u0027s Guardians, begs them to save Nekomamushi, who had a severed arm, and Inuarashi, who had a severed leg...",

        "description": "Chopper explains to his friends that when he arrived with Sanji and Caesar in the gas-infested city, they first left to avoid being poisoned. When they entered the Whale Forest, the same desolate scene awaited them. For his part, Caesar Clown reveals that he is the creator of Koro, the name of the gas that defeated the Mink Tribe, and seems to be enjoying the show. But he is soon called to order by Sanji and Chopper, who order him to find a solution, otherwise the Straw Hat Crew\u0027s cook threatens to destroy the heart in his possession, especially after learning that the gas will kill the Minks within 48 hours. Suddenly, a terrible tremor shakes the island. It\u0027s a Rainy Eruption that submerges the entire forest. Chopper and C\u00e9sar are swept away by the current and saved in extremis from drowning by Sanji. After rescuing them, Sanji hears Nami\u0027s cry, which seems to be in danger, and goes to her rescue, leaving Chopper alone with the Punk Hazard scientist.\nLeaping into the air, Sanji spots his friend in the company of Brook and Momonosuke in a bad way. He arrives in time to save his three friends, striking down Sheephead in front of Gin Rummy, who scurries off with his men. At the same time, Chopper and Caesar have returned to the devastated city, and the reindeer force the scientist to use his powers to purify the air. Caesar Clown complies, using Roko gas to neutralize the effects of the Koro gas! Once all danger has passed, Chopper calls out to his friends in the forest to return to the city. Pedro wakes up just as Sanji\u0027s group is strolling through the desolate streets of Crow Town. He is suddenly attacked by a desperate Wanda, who thought the new arrivals were Jack\u0027s subordinates. Nami subdues Wanda using her climatic stick, but the Mink bitch pulls out a lit stick of dynamite from under her cape, threatening to explode at any moment.\n\nJust as the fuse was about to burn out, Tristan appears and informs Wanda that the people she had just attacked were not part of Jack\u0027s crew and that they had saved her while she was in the clutches of Sheephead and Gin Rummy. Tristan also explains that Jack\u0027s men left Zou while Pedro extinguished the dynamite fuse with his fingers. Pedro explains to Wanda that Nami and her friends had nothing to do with Jack, and that they had succeeded in removing the gas that had spread over the island. For his part, Chopper arrives with Caesar, arms full of test tubes, to make antidotes and tells the Minks that he\u0027s a doctor and that he\u0027s going to save them. He takes charge of the situation and helps all the wounded on the island to get back on their feet. An entire rescue operation is organized: all the gas-affected Minks from Zou\u0027s Right Belly Fortress are brought back to the city to be treated and bandaged by members of the Straw Hat Crew. They also rescue the Heart crew, who have been poisoned at the same time as Minks. Wanda admires such solicitude and offers to help save her tribe.\n\nAfter Inuarashi and Nekomamushi have carefully climbed down from their crosses, Sanji satisfies the island\u0027s entire population with a soup he had prepared with the survivors of the Heart pirates, while Brook plays his famous tune on the violin to bring cheerfulness back into everyone\u0027s hearts. Wanda concludes this story by thanking Luffy\u0027s crew for their immense help when they didn\u0027t know who they were. However, they saved them without hesitation, and Wanda swears to Nami that one day she\u0027ll pay that debt. For their part, Franky cries his eyes out after hearing this story, and Ussop now understands why they were cheered when they arrived on the island. As for Luffy, he swears he\u0027ll defy Kaido and his crew to make them pay for Zou\u0027s attack. Concerned, Chopper wants to visit Nekomamushi in the Whale Forest, as he was due to be awakened. Wanda wanted to go too, because as the King\u0027s Bird, it was her duty to inform him of the Duke of Momoko\u0027s state of health, even if it seemed pointless. Luffy and his friends enthusiastically decide to accompany them to meet the enigmatic Night King in person...",

        "description": "The Straw Hat Crew ride giant crocodiles to Nekomamushi with Wanda and Carrot. Luffy wants to know what happened to Sanji and Momonosuke. Brook begins to explain, playing a few guitar notes, that Sanji will never return to the crew. Luffy is scandalized by this news, but Brook manages to soften his blow by talking about what really happened to their friend. When his group had reached Zou after their confrontation with Big Mom\u0027s crew, Big Mom, having heard of the Straw Hats\u0027 destination, immediately went to Zou two days later, especially as Pekoms, one of Big Mom\u0027s lieutenants, was from the Minks Tribe.\nWhen Pekoms, accompanied by Capone Bege, landed on the island, he found Zou completely ravaged, and was infuriated by the thought that the Mugiwaras were to blame. For their part, Sanji and Nami make friends with the Minks tribe, while at the same time getting the inhabitants back on their feet. Wanda, in keeping with tradition, has given Nami one of her dresses in exchange for her clothes as a sign of friendship, which explains why she has her bra. As for Momonosuke, transformed into a dragon, he had isolated himself in his room because he felt better there. Meanwhile, under Chopper\u0027s watchful eye, Caesar Clown is forced to prepare the remedy to cure all the island\u0027s inhabitants, despite his aversion to saving the people of this country, while Brook fears that his bones will be chewed up by the island\u0027s dog Minks.\n\nAt the same time, at the entrance to the Fortress of Zou\u0027s Right Belly, the two guards guarding the entrance saw two strange figures appear through the mist to meet them. They recognized one of them as Pekoms, who still had ties to the island. He firmly believes that the Straw Hats are responsible for Zou\u0027s devastation, but one of the two guards informs him that everyone is well and that the Mugiwaras have saved the Minks from certain death. Pekoms is overjoyed to hear this news and weeps with joy in front of his family and friends. From the balcony, Nami notices the presence of Big Mom\u0027s pirates, while Pekoms curses the name of Jack for wanting to destroy his native island. Wanda reassures her friend that Pekoms was once a Zou delinquent. Meanwhile, Caesar Clown panics, knowing that Big Mom\u0027s pirates have been looking for him and have orders to capture him and hand him over to their leader. Punk Hazard\u0027s former master explains to Sanji that he was supposed to be doing scientific research for Big Mom, but had done nothing but extort money from her. It was for this reason that she was after him, as were the Straw Hats who had defied the Yonku when they saved Fishman Island, which had previously been under Big Mom\u0027s jurisdiction.\n\nAccompanied by Brook, Sanji wants to clear the air and decides to take Capone and Pekoms to the Right Flank Forest to find out what these two pirates had come to do to Zou. Strangely enough, Pekoms kneels at Sanji\u0027s feet, weeping as he thanks him for saving his people, and swears that he\u0027ll do nothing to capture them, but that they\u0027ll hand Caesar over to Big Mom anyway, making him believe that they\u0027ve inadvertently let the Mugiwaras escape. However, Capone Bege is against this idea and \u0022shoots\u0022 him with his hand thanks to his Demon Fruit under the astonished eyes of the Straw Hats...",

The latter had decided to eliminate Pekoms because he didn\u0027t want to carry out an order from Big Mom to capture the Straw Hats. He personally took charge of the task, using his Demon Fruit, the Shiro Shiro no Mi, which turned him into a veritable castle man. As the two pirates looked on in amazement, Capone Begue brought out the men of his crew who had been hidden inside his body via a drawbridge. Armed with rifles, they return to their human size and surround the two Straw Hats. Sanji recognizes Capone, who was present on the Sabaody Archipelago at the time of Luffy\u0027s altercation with the Celestial Dragons. With a bounty of three hundred million berrys, Capone Begue is ready to do anything to achieve his goal. He brings in his sidekick Vito, who has managed to capture Nami and Chopper and lure Caesar Clown to them. The latter was quickly taken prisoner after Capone threatened to shoot him with bullets made of Sea Granite, a weapon he didn\u0027t actually possess.\nThe leader of the Firetank Crew then orders his prisoners to enter his body through an open breach in his torso. There, surrounded by armed men, Sanji found himself seated at a table opposite Capone, while Chopper, Nami, Brook and Caesar were chained behind him. Big Mom\u0027s right-hand man hands Sanji an invitation to the Tea Party organized by his boss, and informs him that he will be the guest of honor at a wedding organized by Big Mom that will unite the destiny of the Straw Hat Crew\u0027s cook with that of the 35th daughter of Charlotte Linlin\u0027s family.\n\nShocked by this news, which has also upset his friends, Sanji remains paralyzed. For their part, Nami, Brook and Chopper now understand why Sanji was so laconic about his origins, claiming to have been born in North Blue when Luffy and his comrades had met him in East Blue! Coming to his senses, Sanji refuses the wedding invitation offered by Capone Bege, but the latter has no intention of giving him a choice and openly threatens to kill the Straw Hat cook and harm his friends by drowning Nami if he doesn\u0027t do as he says. Yet, unknowingly, they\u0027re already prisoners as they find themselves in Capone\u0027s body on his way to the Tea Party! Suddenly, a strange individual named Vito appears and orders Sanji to accept Capone Bege\u0027s proposal, as he considers it unthinkable to refuse an invitation from his boss at the risk of losing his own life...",

Bege reveals that Big Mom is very influential in the New World and has a multitude of islands under her control. He also adds that he is totally powerless against her and that all he can do now is obey her. Sanji then asks for a pen and a sheet of paper to write a note to his friends. Once this was done, he handed the note to Nami, wedging it between his body and the chains, then told his companions that he had nothing to hide and that the Vinsmoke Family no longer represented him, as that was the past. He adds that he will personally settle this matter before throwing his companions out of Bege\u0027s body, much to the latter\u0027s astonishment. Caesar is indignant that he had forgotten about it.\nIn Bege\u0027s dimension, the pirates under Supernovae\u0027s command try to shoot Sanji to neutralize him, but the Straw Hat Crew\u0027s cook eliminates them one by one. He then grabs Caesar Clown, threatening to kill him by pointing the end of a rifle Sanji had grabbed from one of the guards at his head. Knowing that the Firetank crew couldn\u0027t take Sanji\u0027s life, Capone Begue ordered his men to stay put, as Nekomamushi had arrived outside. Nekomamushi had noticed Pekoms\u0027 bloodied body lying on the floor and asked Capone if he had done it. Begue immediately denies the accusation, but Nami denies it, then, with Brook and Chopper, asks Sanji to come out of the pirate\u0027s body. But, contrary to their expectations, Sanji promises them with a big smile that he\u0027ll be back soon.\n\nSeeing that he has been unmasked, Capone Begue flees, transforming himself into a tank thanks to his Demon Fruit. Nami tries to catch up with him, but loses the note Sanji had written to her. The note falls to the ground as Brook and Chopper cry. Wanda appears and asks her friends to go after Capone, but Brook tells her it\u0027s no use, as Sanji has no intention of coming back anyway, as they later learn when they read his note: \u0022To my friends, I have to go and see a woman. I\u0027ll be back, I promise. Sanji.\u0022\n\nThe three Straw Hats are freed from their chains by Carrot, Rody and Black Back under the watchful eye of Nekomamushi. Wanda suddenly notices the absence of Sanji and Caesar Clown. She thinks they\u0027ve been kidnapped by Capone Begue. But Nami informs her that they have stayed with the pirate of their own free will. Wanda wants to understand their actions, but is quickly brought to order by the Master of the Night, who orders her not to concern herself with the affairs of their saviors, and obliges her to treat Pekoms, who is in a very bad way, immediately.\n\nBack to the present. Luffy learns of Sanji\u0027s note and understands that his friend had abandoned his comrades to go and get married, but that he will return with his wife and that there will then be a new member of the crew. However, Brook brings him back to reality by explaining that Sanji will become one of Big Mom\u0027s subordinates by marrying her 35th daughter. Usopp is particularly intrigued by this mysterious family, the Vinsmoke. If they had indeed come from North Blue, they\u0027d had to cross Red Line to get to East Blue, and now they\u0027re in the New World! As for Zoro, he\u0027s not worried. If Sanji thought he wasn\u0027t coming back, he\u0027d surely have written a different note. The Straw Hats debate whether or not to rescue Sanji. Zoro strongly advises them against doing so, as they and Law\u0027s crew risk attracting the fury of another Emperor after ruining Kaido\u0027s plans by first sacking Punk Hazard Island and then destroying the Smiles Factory at Dressrosa, thus bringing down Doflamingo. Nami won\u0027t tolerate her friend\u0027s opinion, while Luffy decides on a whim to go and save Sanji, whatever the cost...",

For his part, Brook suggests asking Nekomamushi if he knows the location of Big Mom\u0027s Crew, and enlisting the support of Pekoms who, as Mink, owes a debt to the Straw Hats who came to the rescue of his people. Suddenly, they are attacked by Sutchies, giant blood-sucking insects. The Minks, who know about this calamity, have to kill every last one of them, as they have the annoying habit of sucking Zunesha\u0027s blood, which weakens her. But this swarm of Sutchies brings Crocky down, and the pirates of the Straw Hat Crew are forced to fight them on land. They finally get the better of them, thanks to Franky\u0027s initiative, who attracts them by blinding them with \u0022Nipple Light\u0022, while his friends eliminate them one by one.\nAfter this misadventure, they set off again, and Brook takes the opportunity to perform a song in honor of Master Nekomamushi, which puts a smile on the faces of all his companions. At the end of this song, they finally arrive at their destination, more precisely in the residential area of the Guardians of Zou, which is very close to the Whale tree. There, they are cheerfully welcomed by the Minks, where they meet Black Back, Rody and Pedro, the Guardians\u0027 leader, who asks for their forgiveness for attacking them after their arrival on the island. The latter takes Luffy aside to inform him that Trafalgar Law and his men are waiting for them, but the young pirate wishes to see Pekoms and Nekomamushi first. Pedro asks him to keep what happened with Pekoms a secret for the time being. The pirates then go to check on Nekomamushi\u0027s health, and Chopper finds him taking a bath while enjoying a delicious dish of lasagne. On seeing this, the Straw Hat Crew\u0027s doctor becomes angry and severely reprimands his patient for not following his prescribed instructions. Indeed, Chopper reminded him that bathing was strictly forbidden as it could reopen his wounds, and that he should eat lightly without using his bandaged left arm. Nekomamushi, however, does as he pleases, much to Chopper\u0027s despair, who gives him another injection as his wounds have reopened. Luffy and his companions then head off to Pekoms\u0027 bedside, where he gradually recovers from the assault he suffered at the hands of Capone Bege. He reveals to the Straw Hat and his crew that Big Mom and Sanji\u0027s father jointly arranged the young man\u0027s wedding, and that his father is a famous man in the underworld, as the Vinsmoke Family is a fearsome family of assassins. The family, originally from North Blue, is the head of Germa 66, nicknamed \u0022The Belligerents\u0022, a criminal organization that wreaks havoc across the planet...",

        "description": "Nami is stunned to learn that Sanji is part of a family of assassins who head Germa 66, but Luffy is indifferent. He replies that what matters to him is whether Sanji comes back or not. He tells Pekoms that he\u0027ll tolerate Sanji\u0027s marriage, but that he can\u0027t become Big Mom\u0027s subordinate (although marriage implies it). At this point, Pekoms starts to twitch and falls out of bed. He tells Luffy that although he owes him a debt, there\u0027s nothing he can do because Big Mom is one of the Four Emperors, and that in any case, Sanji\u0027s fate is sealed because he can\u0027t escape the marriage. Indeed, when someone declines an invitation to one of Big Mom\u0027s Tea Parties, they receive a most unpleasant gift: the severed head of one of his relatives, who was decapitated by Big Mom\u0027s Crew. Nami realizes that these were the words Vito had spoken in Sanji\u0027s ear. For his part, Pekoms tells them that they won\u0027t actually become Big Mom\u0027s subordinates, as the planned marriage between Sanji and one of her daughters is a political one, sealing an alliance between the Vinsmoke and Charlotte families. As a result, Sanji will no longer be a member of the Straw Hats.\nLuffy is furious with Pekoms when he hears this news, because there\u0027s no way Sanji will abandon his friends. To defuse the situation, Pekoms announces that he\u0027ll be joining Big Mom\u0027s crew as soon as he can to take his revenge on Capone Bege. Luffy takes the opportunity to ask Pekoms to accompany him in order to infiltrate the Tea Party and cancel the wedding. The Straw Hat wants to go alone because, as Zoro had said, Kaido is already after them. Luffy then leaves the room and asks Zoro, who was waiting for him outside, if he\u0027s worried about Sanji, which the swordsman flatly denies. Luffy hears his friends arrive and takes advantage of the moment to tell Chopper that Pekoms is banging his head against the walls and moaning in pain, symptoms that have Chopper very worried. For his part, Brook has a run-in with some doggy Minks who are after his skeletal body. Suddenly, Nekomamushi appears, jumping and frolicking, which panics Chopper, who fears that the Duke\u0027s wounds are in danger of opening up again. The master of the night affectionately throws himself at Luffy and Zoro, infuriating the latter, who threatens to slice him up. After these incidents, Luffy spots Law and his crew. The former Shichibukai asks to speak to Luffy and his men alone, which greatly saddens his crew, led by Bepo, who wanted the Straw Hat to get to know them. Talking to the Straw Hats, Trafalgar Law learns of Sanji\u0027s affair and Luffy asks him to wait a while for Kaido. But Law is adamantly against it, as he thought they could be left alone in Zou.\n\nWhile the islanders are happy to see that some pirates were worried about them, Nekomamushi wakes up from his coma and orders his subjects to prepare a huge banquet for his guests, a decision that delights Luffy greatly. While the party is in full swing, Robin, Franky and Brook keep watch at the entrance to the island and discuss the Samurai problem, unaware that Kinemon and Kanjuro are in the process of climbing Zunesha\u0027s hind leg. The three pirates are determined to prevent the two warriors from the Land of Wa from setting foot on the island, as its inhabitants do not tolerate the presence of samurai. Especially as it\u0027s pointless for them to come, since Raizou, the man Jack and his men are looking for, isn\u0027t on Zou, and if the Minks learn that their island is a samurai rendezvous point, they\u0027ll go ballistic. The next morning, however, Robin, Brook and Franky are asleep! Meanwhile, the two samurai\u0027s ascent of Zou Island with Minks the monkey on Torasaburo\u0027s back has just come to an end. They\u0027re delighted to have reached their goal, and look forward to rejoining Raizou. When they tell Bariete about the latter, the little monkey takes fright and flees in panic to warn the Minks of the intrusion of two samurai on their island...",

        "description": "As the sun rises over Zou, Franky wakes up in a panic to find that the samurai have arrived on the island while they were sleeping. He immediately awakens Robin and Brook, sharing his concerns and showing them the silhouette of a strange tiger drawn on the ground by Kanjuro, next to Ryuunosuke. The situation is serious, as the two warriors from the Land of Wa could meet Minks on the road at any moment and ask them if they had seen Raizou. Meanwhile, Bariete, the little monkey who had accompanied Kinemon and Kanjuro during their ascent of Zunesha\u0027s hind leg, runs breathlessly through the forest to activate the alarm bell to warn his fellow monkeys of the samurai\u0027s intrusion. The Minks, who hear the sound of the bell, are stunned, while Duke Inuarashi, despite his wounds, prepares, with the help of his precious musketeers led by Sicilian, to face new enemies. For his part, Nekomamushi is also ready for battle and rushes through the forest, followed by the faithful Guardians of Zou, to drive the invaders from the island.\nAwakened by the tumult, Nami notices the commotion around her and tries to rouse Luffy from his slumber. She succeeds somehow, before turning to her other companions, who notice that something unusual has happened on the island. While Bariete continues to raise the alarm, Kinemon and Kanjuro, without the slightest fear, walk into the forest and assume that the ringing bell means there\u0027s a guest in the territory and that they\u0027ll be well received. They are soon joined by Momonosuke, who is delighted to see them again. The young boy explains that he had been feeling uncomfortable since arriving on the island, so he isolated himself and slept in a room. And when he woke up, he found that no one was there, so he decided to set off in search of Luffy. But instead of running into the Straw Hat, he found the two samurai. Satisfied with this outcome, he continued on with the samurai, while Luffy\u0027s group, Duke Inuarashi\u0027s musketeers and King Nekomamushi\u0027s guards formed groups to search for the samurai on Zou, heading for Crow Town.\n\nNekomamushi and his troops reach the town first. The master of the night orders his faithful Pedro to climb onto the roof of a building to spot any intruders. The chief guard carries out his order, but instead of seeing a samurai, he witnesses Inuarashi\u0027s arrival in the devastated city. Fearing that the dukes of the island of Zou might meet and come to blows, Pedro advises his master to withdraw, but the latter does not obey. As expected, Inuarashi and Nekomamushi end up meeting. It was at this point that Kinemon, Kanjuro and Momonosuke entered the city, but they were not spotted by the Minks as they were too absorbed in the forthcoming battle between Zou\u0027s two leaders. Just when all seemed lost, Luffy and his friends arrive on the scene and intercept the three samurai before the islanders notice them.\n\nAs the situation escalates between the two dukes, much to the despair of their subjects, they make disparaging remarks to each other about the limbs they\u0027ve lost as a result of Jack and his men\u0027s intrusion on their island, and provoke each other in front of the crowd. After a long sizing-up, Inuarashi draws his sword from its scabbard and attacks Nekomamushi first. Nekomamushi defends himself by using his spear to parry his opponent\u0027s maneuvers. Kinemon, who has escaped the vigilance of the Straw Hats, spots the two fighters and is surprised by their appearance. Despite Usopp\u0027s pleas, Kinemon emerges from hiding and orders Inuarashi and Nekomamushi to stop fighting immediately. His intervention does not go unnoticed, as all the Minks notice that the samurai are already among them!\n\nUnconcerned about the danger threatening him, and soon joined by Kanjuro and Momonosuke, Kinemon introduces himself to the Minks as a servant of the Kouzuki Clan of the Land of Wa, and that he is in search of Raizou. This revelation upsets the members of the Straw Hat Crew, who dread fighting the Minks Tribe in defense of their comrades. When Inuarashi and Nekomamushi reach them, they sit down and start crying. Inuarashi reveals to Kinemon that Raizou is safe on Zou. Still reeling from this revelation, Luffy and his friends realize that the Minks had concealed the samurai\u0027s existence from Jack, even if it meant plunging their country into chaos, torture and death. Ussop doesn\u0027t understand the situation and tries to make sense of it, unable to stop his tears. Nekomamushi tries to calm him down, apologizing for having to keep the secret, as the people of Zou have been allies of the Kouzuki Clan of the Land of Wa since time immemorial, and would do anything not to betray their friends...",

Jack asks his subordinates if he himself is dead, which they deny. After angrily tearing up the newspaper, he orders them to sail faster.\nAt the same time, in the devastated city of Crow Town, Kinemon expresses his immense gratitude to the Minks. To prove that he is indeed of the Kouzuki clan, he lowers the top of his kimono to reveal the \u0022Kouzuki Family\u0022 mark tattooed on his back. For her part, Wanda confirms that he does indeed belong, as the insignia is also worn by the two dukes. As for Usopp, he\u0027s relieved to know that the Minks and the three samurai were on the same side. However, when Inuarashi tries to speak to Kinemon, Nekomamushi interrupts him to speak for him. The two leaders of Zou quarrel again, much to the despair of their people, and come to blows despite Wanda\u0027s pleas. Excited by this spectacle, Momonosuke, crying, stops them, saying that his father would be very unhappy if they saw them like this. Strangely, the two dukes obey and apologize to the young boy. Kinemon explains to the Straw Hats that Momonosuke is not his son, but that of Kouzuki Oden, the Daimyo of Kuri in the Land of Wa. He had imagined this filiation to avoid drawing the attention of their enemies to the young boy.\n\nMomonosuke asks Luffy to bow, but the latter refuses, provoking an argument between them. To prove his importance, Momonosuke snuggles up to Nami\u0027s chest, then Robin\u0027s, provoking Brook\u0027s jealousy, who calls the boy a pervert. A general merriment then breaks out between the Straw Hats and the Three Samurai that moves the two dukes. They agree not to quarrel any more because of the presence of Oden\u0027s heir. They then shake hands so as not to sadden the Daimyo\u0027s son, before the astonished eyes of their subjects.\n\nAfter the appearance of a rainbow provoked by Zunesha, in the company of Luffy\u0027s crew and Trafalgar Law, the two dukes happily take the Samurai to the top of the whale tree to see Raizou. During the climb, Momonosuke is bothered by a voice in his head that only he can hear, and which increases the closer he gets to the top of the tree. Kinemon notices that hearing a voice that others can\u0027t perceive is a gift similar to Oden\u0027s ability. For their part, Inuarashi and Nekomamushi confirm that this was also the ability of another man they had known in the past. The small party arrive at an entrance concealed in the whale\u0027s \u0022tail\u0022, which hides a long staircase with immense steps. Luffy and his companions hear Raizou shouting and are eager to meet this famous ninja, imagining warriors with elegant techniques. They finally arrive at the foot of the huge staircase to find Raizou looking very strange indeed: an almost deformed man with a huge head and an improbable haircut, crying and angry at Nekomamushi for locking him in that cache during Jack\u0027s attack. This appearance shatters the idea Luffy and his friends had of Raizou, and they notice that the ninja was chained to a mysterious red poneglyph...",

        "description": "Raizou struggles like hell, but is firmly chained. He suddenly notices Nekomamushi\u0027s severed arm and asks him what happened to it. In response, Nekomamushi apologizes to him for having treated him like that to protect him during Jack\u0027s attack, while Luffy and his friends, with the exception of Brook who has stayed behind, are dismayed by Raizou\u0027s appearance. As for Usopp, he imagines that Raizou doesn\u0027t have what it takes to be a very good ninja. For their part, the three samurai accompanying the Straw Hats are delighted to find their missing companion. Kinemon hastens to free his friend, who is also overwhelmed by joy, but changes his mind when he sees the discomfited faces of the pirates, who are still not satisfied with Raizou\u0027s thankless appearance.\nLast to arrive, Brook , Nami and Robin enter the hiding place where Raizou had been concealed. The young archaeologist was astonished to see the Kouzuki family crest painted on one of the walls. Inuarashi, who had accompanied the pirates, explains that this coat of arms has been on Zou for centuries. But Robin\u0027s attention is especially drawn to a mysterious Poneglyph whose bright red color confuses her greatly. Her confusion is accentuated when she learns that Nekomamushi and Inuarashi know who she is and that she was originally from the island of Ohara. At the mention of this name, painful memories resurface in Robin\u0027s mind, and she relives scenes from her past, when she first saw a Poneglyph, when she attended Professor Clover\u0027s classes and when she survived the Buster Call that completely wiped out her native island.\n\nRobin then asks Inuarashi why the Poneglyph is red. The Duke replies that it has a different function to the others, before asking her if she can read what\u0027s written on it. The young woman answers in the affirmative before rushing off enthusiastically to decipher the stele, while the rest of her companions continue to stare ostentatiously at Raizou. The latter is troubled by their stares, and Kinemon takes advantage of the moment to introduce the Straw Hat Crew to his friend, who seems disdainful of them. Suddenly, Luffy, Chopper and Usopp ask him in turn for a demonstration of his ninja skills, and even Zoro and Law get in on the act, wanting to know if Raizou can live up to his reputation. But Raizou refuses, believing that the techniques on offer don\u0027t really exist and are simply fantasies. Nevertheless, the three pirates continue to insist and Raizou is obliged to oblige. He then shows them three Ninjutsu techniques he has mastered to perfection: disappearance, cloning and the art of throwing Shurikens. Luffy and his friends are highly impressed by his prowess, and fall under his spell.\n\nAfter showing them what he can do, Raizou comes out of hiding and, in the company of his friends, discovers the full extent of Zou\u0027s devastation. He is devastated when he sees the ruins of the city of Crow Town and begins to weep, as do Kinemon and Kanjuro, as he realizes that all this disaster has been suffered for the sole purpose of protecting him. Raizou then expresses his gratitude to the Minks and promises to do everything in his power to avenge them. This moment of intense emotion comes to an end when Nekomamushi reappears to call on them to return to the Whale Tree, for the Poneglyph has been deciphered. Indeed, Robin had finished the translation she had written on a sheet of paper, which Nami reads while Inuarashi explains to the pirates the true function of this special poneglyph, which is called a \u0022Road Poneglyph\u0022. He also reveals that there are three other such poneglyphs scattered around the world, each indicating the position of four different islands, and that once these four poneglyphs have been discovered, they will indicate, crescent-shaped on their diagonal, the end of Grand Line, i.e. the exact location of Rough-Tell, the place where the famous \u0022One Piece\u0022 is said to be hidden...",

        "description": "Like all his friends, Luffy marvels at the Road Poneglyph and wonders if Rough-Tell is where the famous One Piece is. Knowing that Gol D. Roger had the ability to read these mysterious inscriptions, Robin recalls one she found in Shandora, written in the famous Pirate King\u0027s own hand. For his part, Luffy is excited at the prospect of finally getting his hands on the One Piece, and Ussop has a hard time reasoning with his friend. The Straw Hat has every intention of going to Whole Cake Island to rescue Sanji, but Nekomamushi talks him out of it. Nekomamushi reveals that one of the Poneglyphs is in Kaido\u0027s possession, another in Big Mom\u0027s, and the last one has yet to be found. On learning that two of the four Road Poneglyphs belong to emperors, Nami, Usopp, Chopper and Brook take fright. But this same fear is not shared by the rest of their companions, who are eager to steal the Poneglyphs. However, Nekomamushi advises them not to seize these huge blocks of carved stone directly, but rather to obtain the inscriptions on them by employing a very simple technique of copying the text by friction, i.e. by putting ink on it and sticking a sheet of paper over it to impregnate itself with the text.\nEnthralled by this plan, Usopp devises a way to get hold of these texts by discreetly breaking into Big Mom\u0027s palace in the middle of the night without arousing suspicion, but this doesn\u0027t please Luffy, who starts bickering with him because he doesn\u0027t want to become the next King of the Pirates by using subterfuge. Far from these concerns, Nekomamushi is worried about Robin, as she knows how to read Poneglyphs and could be the target of several influential people in this world who want to kidnap her to discover the secrets of the Forgotten Century. However, the young archaeologist reassures him that she has companions strong enough to protect her.\n\nFar from Zou, Jack has fallen asleep and remembers his assault on the Navy ships and his vain attempt to rescue Doflamingo. Doflamingo was being closely watched by Sengoku, Fujitora, Tsuru and many other important officers. The two adversaries fought a fierce battle, but the cannonballs fired at the navy ships were stopped by Fujitora. Jack then recalls the moment when he approached the flagship and saw Fujitora, Sengoku and Tsuru facing him. This last vision had obviously traumatized him, and he emerged from his sleep sweating as if he\u0027d had a terrible nightmare. He rises from his bed as one of his men informs him of the presence of Sheephead and Gin Rummy on his ship, wounded after their altercation with Sanji.\n\nAt the same time, at the Whale Tree, Nekomamushi reveals to Robin, with Momonosuke\u0027s consent, the origin of the Poneglyphs. He tells him that the Kouzuki Family was a clan of stonecutters from generation to generation, and that it was thanks to them that the indestructible Poneglyphs had existed for almost 800 years! However, Momonosuke\u0027s generation had not learned to decipher these signs, as the transmission of this ancestral art had abruptly stopped with Momonosuke\u0027s father, a certain Kouzuki Oden, who was executed by Kaido and the Shogun of the Land of Wa, where Kaido\u0027s Crew is currently stationed. This was the reason why Kaido had pursued Kinemon and his companions, as Oden had once been a member of Gol D. Roger\u0027s crew, and he knows the location. Roger and knows the exact location of Rough-Tell, as well as all the secrets of this world. On hearing this news, Luffy is troubled. He suddenly realizes that he is looking at the son of the daimyo who had traveled with Roger, and seems to find it hard to believe...",

        "description": "Crying like Momonosuke, Kinemon and Kanjuro confirm to Luffy that Kouzuki Oden was indeed part of Gol D. Roger\u0027s crew and that he knew the secret about the world, the Forgotten Century. Roger\u0027s crew and that he knew the secret about the world, the Forgotten Century. On learning this, Nico Robin understands the importance of the Poneglyphs and the message they conceal, the lost century that the World Government wished to hide forever from the eyes of the world. However, the scientists on the island of Ohara had discovered this secret, but they were annihilated by a Buster Call decided by the World Government to ensure that the secret would never be divulged.\nWhen Luffy asks the three Samurai if they also know the truth about the world, they reply that they don\u0027t, and even if they did, they wouldn\u0027t tell him. Moreover, if Kinemon and his companions are so ignorant on this subject, it\u0027s because their lord Oden didn\u0027t want to pass on his knowledge to them, and his last sentence before dying was: \u0022Open the Land of Wa\u0022. Indeed, as Brook explains to Chopper, the Land of Wa is a totally closed country, isolated from the rest of the world. It is therefore impossible to enter or leave. The Daimyo of Wa, however, wanted this system to be a thing of the past. Kinemon, Kanjuro and Raizou lament and blame themselves for not having been able to carry out this mission and fight Kaido. With tear-filled eyes, Kinemon even admits to \u0022shaming Oden\u0022. He reveals to Luffy and his friends his intention to take back the Land of Wa from the Shogun and Kaido with the help of the Minks.\n\nNekomamushi and Inuarashi confirm Kinemon\u0027s claims, asserting that the Minks and the warriors of the Land of Wa have been allies since the dawn of time. The two Samurai and Raizou bow to the two Dukes of Zou, then beg Luffy and Law to help them defeat Kaido. However, the Straw Hat refuses to help them, much to everyone\u0027s astonishment. Kinemon, despite his respect for Luffy, is astonished by his decision, while the various members of the Straw Hat crew try to reason with their captain or believe that he\u0027s playing a joke on them. For his part, Usopp goes so far as to hit Luffy to make him change his mind quickly. But, alone against all odds, the Straw Hat advises Momonosuke to speak up for himself. In tears, Momonosuke steps forward and tells him that, as heir, his only wish is to eliminate Kaido. As he says this, the little boy recalls the episode when the Shogun and Kaido had devastated his country. He had seen his homeland put to the sword. As he fled, he had witnessed the murder of his mother, killed by Kaido himself! Kaido stood before him and insulted his father, calling him a weak lord.\n\nBack to the present. Still haunted by the memory of his parents\u0027 murder, Momonosuke expresses his will to bring Kaido down and, although still a child, begs the Straw Hats\u0027 help to avenge the death of his father and mother. Moved, Luffy accepts his request and shakes hands with dignity to confirm his word. Surprised by this turn of events, Momonosuke can\u0027t stop his tears from flowing and warmly thanks Luffy for his help. However, Luffy wasn\u0027t done yet: having consoled Momonosuke, he now wishes to seal an alliance between the pirates, the Minks and the warriors of the Land of Wa, vowing to eliminate Kaido once and for all...",

        "description": "Admiring the Whale Tree, Wanda and Carrot agree that it\u0027s a wonderful day. Indeed, as Wanda says, Nekomamushi and Inuarashi have finally reconciled after years of quarrelling. For his part, Pedro, perched on his tree, says he never thought such a day would come, especially knowing that the two dukes had once plied the seas together, and were then the best of friends. But after their years of piracy, their temperament had changed and they wanted to kill each other every time they crossed paths. Carrot asks Wanda if this happened when she wasn\u0027t yet born, which her friend confirms. Suddenly, a Mink proposes a banquet in honor of the truce between Inuarashi and Nekomamushi, an idea taken up by the other Minks, who are thrilled to know that they can now get up or go to bed whenever they please.\nAt the same time, near the Road Poneglyph, Luffy contemplates his new Ninja-Pirate-Minks-Samurai alliance and announces that his plan is to take down Kaido. However, there\u0027s one condition: he must first recover Sanji, who is still Big Mom\u0027s prisoner. Raizou recommends waiting for Luffy to recover Sanji, and Inuarashi asks if it\u0027s not too risky. However, the Straw Hat replies that he won\u0027t be facing Big Mom directly, as he\u0027s going with \u0022Pekomamushi\u0022 in reference to Pekoms, a nickname that makes Nekomamushi laugh. Meanwhile, out at sea, Jack and his men are getting dangerously close to Zou. Sheephead is hanging upside down by his feet, his body bleeding, next to Jack. Jack has paid for not finding Raizou. Seeing his comrade tied up, Gin Rummy silently begs Sheephead not to reveal to their leader that they\u0027ve been thrown off the island by the Straw Hats. Suddenly, Jack announces his plan: to find Raizou, not by attacking the Minks as one of the pirates suggests, but by shooting Zunesha, the huge elephant carrying Zou on its back. Gin Rummy is surprised by this method, as the elephant she sees in front of her seems too massive to be wounded!\n\nBack on Zou, the alliance of Minks, Pirates and Samurai leaves the Whale Tree and, on the way to Crown Town, Nekomamushi reveals to Luffy that he knows Shanks personally and had even sailed with him. Luffy is stunned to learn this, especially as Inuarashi confirms the fact, adding that they had also sailed on the Oro Jackson with the Pirate King himself and his crew. He denied, however, that he had been one of his men, as he and Nekomamushi, as disciples of Momonosuke\u0027s father Kouzuki Oden, had had to board many ships. In addition to Luffy, Ussop and the other Straw Hats are surprised to learn that Nekomamushi and Inuarashi had also traveled aboard Whitebeard\u0027s Moby Dick before Oden and the two Minks joined Roger\u0027s crew. Usopp scrupulously recorded all this information in a notebook that never left his side, while Nekomamushi recalled the incredible adventures he\u0027d had while traveling the world: a sea of clouds, an underwater world and so on. Playful, the two dukes dance together, much to Usopp\u0027s astonishment. Luffy then asks the three Samurai if they had done the same, which Kinemon refutes, as the Land of Wa is a country cut off from the world. They reassure Luffy, however, that they had seen Shanks, Rayleigh and the other men of Gol D.\u0027s team when they landed on the island. Roger when they landed in the Land of Wa. As Brook wistfully recalls Crocus, which he had known so well in the past, Nami raises the issue of the Log Poses, which logically lead to a single final island, i.e. Raftel. Inuarashi reassures her that the Log Poses never lie and will always lead her to her destination.\n\nLeaving the Whale Tree for good, the little group prepares to go and fight Kaido. While Kinemon decides to rally other samurai from the Land of Wa to his cause, Nekomamushi explains to the Straw Hats that he must enlist the help of Marco, who leads the remnants of Whitebeard\u0027s Crew, to carry out his plan to slay one of the four Emperors...",

        "description": "Luffy and his friends are perplexed when they hear Marco\u0027s name uttered by Nekomamushi. Some, like the Straw Hat, try to remember him, while others, like Robin, are astonished to hear the name spoken all the way to Zou. Nekomamushi assures them that there is a tiny hope of finding Marco who, as Whitebeard\u0027s former right-hand man, would be a great help in their fight against Kaido, which is just around the corner. For his part, Luffy still can\u0027t remember him, and Robin points out that Marco\u0027s face looks a lot like a pineapple. With his friend\u0027s help, Luffy remembers Marco and then remembers when Marco saved him from Kuzan during the terrible battle at the top of Marineford. He then learns from Inuarashi and Nekomamushi that Marco and the surviving members of Whitebeard\u0027s crew had, a year ago, attempted revenge against Blackbeard\u0027s crew, but were defeated and had disappeared without a trace. Robin confirms this, adding that the battle was a terrible one, and that Marco and his companions had very little chance of winning. After the battle, Blackbeard was promoted to emperor by the World Government. Usopp was astonished that Luffy didn\u0027t know about this battle. However, the Straw Hat remembers that Jinbei had told him that Whitebeard\u0027s pirates had saved him in Marineford. Luffy clearly remembers the incident when he was devastated by Ace\u0027s death. Akainu had taken advantage of the situation to attack him and was about to deliver the coup de grace when he was blocked by Marco, who refused to see Ace\u0027s little brother die. It was thanks to his help that Jinbei had been able to leave the island with the Straw Hat. After recalling these memories, Luffy looks forward to meeting Marco again to thank him for saving his life.\nFor his part, Kinemon announces to the Straw Hats his intention to return to the Land of Wa with his companions to enlist volunteers to fight Kaido. However, a thorny problem arises, as their homeland is occupied by Kaido\u0027s pirates and administered by the Shogun, who is at Kaido\u0027s beck and call. The samurai is aware of the risks, and receives unexpected help from Trafalgar Law, who offers to take him and his friends to their destination aboard his submarine. Kinemon, Kanjuro and Raizou eagerly accept his help. As for Nekomamushi, he declares that he will search for Marco with his men, as he knows where he is at the moment. As they speak, dozens of happy Minks pounce on Raizou, seeing him for the first time in broad daylight, and decide to organize a banquet in his honor. However, Nami dissuades Luffy from succumbing to these new revels and wasting no time in going to rescue Sanji. She tells him she\u0027ll be coming with him, as the Straw Hat is unable to set sail for the New World without her navigational skills. For his part, Chopper volunteers for the expedition, informing his friends that Pekoms is still badly wounded and will need a good doctor to help him through the journey to Big Mom\u0027s lair. The same goes for Brook, who wants to do his bit by bolstering their morale with his music. The team tasked with recovering Sanji is ready. Ussop and his friends wish them luck, while Robin asks Luffy to make a copy of the Poneglyph in Big Mom\u0027s possession, while she enquires about the one hidden by Kaido in the Land of Wa.\n\nThe big moment of departure has finally arrived, and the group of pirates heading for Whole Cake Island is about to leave. But suddenly, Zunesha starts barking violently and some of them, like Zoro and Nekomamushi, feel something strange. The situation worsens as Zunesha pitches dangerously to one side, being shot at by cannonballs fired from Jack\u0027s ships close to Zou. Their attack is as powerful as an earthquake\u0027s, and the whole island is rocked by the jolts of the enormous pachyderm, which is howling in pain under the onslaught of Kaido\u0027s pirates. Nekomamushi, who can hear the pachyderm\u0027s barking better thanks to his over-developed hearing, asserts that Zunesha is crying. The buildings slide and eventually collapse. Fortunately, Franky and Robin join forces to rescue the inhabitants from the rubble, as does Law, who uses her powers to help.\n\nAs Jack and his men attack Zunesha\u0027s left foreleg with their cannons, Luffy is disturbed by a voice in his head that he can\u0027t identify. The same thing happens to Momonosuke, who finds the voice extremely loud. It tells them to hurry up. Apparently, Luffy and Momonosuke are the only two islanders who can hear the voice, and this disturbs them. Down below, Jack and his fleet continue to bombard Zunesha. Kaido\u0027s right-hand man insists that what he has in front of him is an old animal that will fall, and urges his men to concentrate their fire on the front left leg. The voice in Luffy and Momonosuke\u0027s head asks them to give him an order; but Luffy, screaming in pain, asks him what the order is and who is talking to them now...",

Indeed, they are the only two people on the island who can hear this voice. Pedro has guessed what they\u0027re going through. He informs the Straw Hats that Gol D. Roger, like Oden, also heard a voice to which they were unable to respond.\nThe situation on the island worsens: buildings continue to collapse and Franky saves Tristan from certain death by holding back a house that was about to crush him. For her part, Wanda calls on the population to get together and move away from the buildings. Zoro and Raizou save others, while Nekomamushi and Inuarashi guess that something serious has happened to Zunisha. As for Momonosuke, he is in increasing pain and, in his head, sees what Zunisha\u0027s eyes see. Despite the pain, Kouzuki Oden\u0027s son sees Jack and his fleet gunning down the elephant supporting Zou. On learning who was attacking them, Inuarashi orders the island\u0027s Musketeers and Guardians to counter Jack\u0027s fleet by returning fire, but Zunisha pitches ever higher, to the dismay of the population. Momonosuke manages to hear Zunisha\u0027s voice in pain. He warns her that if she faints, everyone on the island will be in great danger. Thanks to this confession, the little boy discovers to his horror that this big voice belongs to the elephant himself!\n\nContinuing to talk with Zunisha, Momonosuke learns that long ago, the elephant committed a crime and was punished and forced to walk the sea for eternity, acting only on command until the end of time. However, Zunisha asks Momonosuke to give him permission to fight just once. Momonosuke hesitates as Jack\u0027s shots get heavier. Not knowing what to do, he asks Kinemon and Kanjuro for advice, and they don\u0027t know what to say. Luffy steps in and orders Momonosuke to command the elephant before it hurls them into the ocean. The little boy complies, shouting at the top of his voice to get rid of Jack, and Zunisha, who had understood his words, takes it upon herself to totally annihilate his assailants by pulverizing them with her trunk!\n\nHaving done her work, Zunisha continues walking as if nothing had happened. The monkey Bariete has witnessed the whole scene and reports what he has seen to the people of Zou, who are stunned by this turn of events. Kinemon wonders if Momonosuke inherited this ability from his father, while Usopp points out that Jack, as a Demon Fruit user, must have perished in the ocean. Nekomamushi confirms this and tells him that we must find out how Jack got to Zou, otherwise this place will never be safe again. For his part, Luffy prepares for his rescue expedition and asks Nekomamushi for food, handing him his shopping bag.\n\nAt the same time, somewhere on a snow-covered island, in a dark room, Kaido receives a snail phone call from Scratchmen Apoo informing him that all contact with Jack has been severed. This news makes Kaido growl with anger...",

        "description": "Musatobi, a flying squirrel Mink, glides up to Zunesha\u0027s leg and sees the wounds Jack had inflicted by attacking the elephant. Meanwhile, on Zou, Nekomamushi gives Luffy permission to take as much food as he wants to undertake his rescue mission. For his part, Inuarashi asks Carrot to take the Straw Hat to the food stocks. Just as they\u0027re about to go, Luffy catches Musatobi in the head on his way back from his inspection tour. Musatobi calls out to the Dukes to alert them. He explains that Zunesha\u0027s left front leg is badly injured, and that it was a miracle that the huge pachyderm could still stand. However, Zunesha is starting to sway dangerously as if he were about to collapse. Chopper understands the situation and asks Luffy if their departure can be postponed for a day, so that Zunesha can be properly cared for. The Straw Hat accepts his request despite the reluctance of the two dukes, who want to look after her personally. But Luffy insists, as they now form an alliance.\nAfter clearing up any remaining misgivings, Chopper fetches the medicinal herbs, while Robin and Franky think about how to bandage such a wound. Then the carpenter of the Straw Hat Crew has an idea. He asks the Minks around him how they get their boats out. Sicilian arrives just then and shows him the warehouse where the boats are stored. Entering the building, Franky is dismayed to see that all the boats are worn out, but he spots a winch that might come in handy. Sicilian explains that this is how the Minks launch their boats. Franky decides to restore the system and use it to lower the boats that will carry the people who will bandage Zunesha. But this requires wood. At Franky\u0027s request, Kinemon, Zoro and Brook go to work cutting down trees in the Whale Forest. Realizing what he was about to do, Sicilian orders the Minks to help save Zunesha. While everyone was busy tending to the huge elephant, Nami asked Wanda if she had a map leading to Big Mom Island, which would be easier for her to navigate. Pedro stepped in and told them he had one.\n\nEnthused by the idea of saving Zunesha, all the inhabitants of Zou set to work. Chopper harvests the herbs with other Minks, which impresses Miyagi and Tristan, who didn\u0027t know they could be used for medicine. Robin, meanwhile, uses his Demon Fruit to sew a bandage from the tablecloths used for banquets, while Brook slices trees with panache before the astonished eyes of the Minks. Kinemon is not to be outdone, helping the living skeleton with his sabers, which have the unfortunate tendency to ignite the trunks. Raizou steps in and puts out the fire with a small watering can. Zoro tries to do the same and cuts a few planks, but his poor sense of direction means he\u0027s gone in the opposite direction to the Minks and Brooks! Law arrives to mock him, as does Carrot, who accompanies Luffy. After this episode, Law uses his gifts to teleport Zoro to the right place, with the planks. At the same time, in his tree house, Pedro shows Wanda and Nami the map showing Big Mom\u0027s territories. Nami deduces that it would take about a week\u0027s sailing to reach the island. Pedro and Wanda agree that they should travel with the Straw Hats to thank them for all their kindness. Taking a closer look at the map, Nami notices a small island that could perhaps be of use to them. Suddenly, the young sailor spots a \u0022Thundercell\u0022 outside, an unpredictable cloud that is usually the source of a great storm. At the same time, Franky demonstrates his carpentry skills by restoring the damaged ships in a matter of seconds. These are then lowered to the level of Zunesha\u0027s wound. The Minks begin to apply the bandage, but are surprised by the storm.\n\nKnowing what was about to happen, Nami, Luffy, Wanda and Carrot rush to their front, riding Crocky. Carrot takes the Straw Hat leaping skywards, while the caretakers have to contend with the violent winds that are battering the ropes. Some ropes crack and a few Minks are ejected from their gondola. Luffy arrives in time to catch them with his elastic arm. But the situation worsens when Zunesha quickens her pace because of the storm. The whole structure created by Franky threatens to collapse. Just as Chopper is about to live his last hour, he is saved by the Straw Hat, who pulls with all his might on one end of the winch to prevent it sinking into the sea, taking the Minks with it. While Carrot is stunned by what she has just seen, Robin intervenes and uses her powers to bring all the Minks who had come to heal the elephant to their feet.\n\nAfter the winch has been repaired, Carrot accompanies Luffy to the pantry. There, the young pirate fills his bag with provisions while Carrot tells him all about his crew, flattering him excessively to accept his request to travel with them to Big Mom\u0027s territories. However, Luffy doesn\u0027t listen to what she\u0027s telling him, because he\u0027s just remembered someone: Pekoms. He abandons Carrot to go and join him. At the same time, the Minks have finished healing Zunesha and thank the Straw Hats warmly for helping them. Even Sicilian bows down, for they have saved his country twice. Far from these concerns, perched on the gateway to the Duchy of Mokomo, Carrot is bored, while Bariete can\u0027t understand what\u0027s happening to her friend. The latter, desperate to leave with Luffy, tries to bribe Bariete by showing her two bananas she\u0027d taken from the pantry, while the Straw Hat happily runs off in the direction of Pekoms\u0027 whereabouts...",

        "description": "While the Minks are busy healing Zunisha\u0027s leg, which is gradually recovering from Jack\u0027s attack, Miyagi congratulates Chopper on his medical skills. He advises him to remove the bandages to see how the pachyderm\u0027s wound is progressing. He then says that today, the Minks have realized that they are alive thanks to this splendid elephant, and that this elephant has a will of its own. Miyagi adds that he\u0027d like to ask Zunisha where he\u0027s going now after walking for a millennium. At the same time, on Zou, Momonosuke informs a puzzled Kinemon that he wants to stay on the island. He explains that he wants to communicate with Zunisha again, since he was the only one who could give her an order. According to Ouden\u0027s son, Zunisha might know something about the Kouzuki clan. Raizou and Kanjuro arrived just then, and Kinemon told his young master that there were people waiting for them in the Land of Wa. Inuarashi joins them to confirm and says that he too will not be able to accompany them to their kingdom, as he must continue to ensure Zou\u0027s safety. He tells Kinemon, however, that he will come to Wa Land with Momonosuke later.\nThe Samurai agreed, and cut up several pieces of the Life Card Nekomamushi had made for him. He concludes that the Ninja-Pirate-Minks-Samurai alliance will then split into four groups: the first group, led by Nekomamushi, will go in search of Marco. The second group, made up of Inuarashi, his Musketeers and Momonosuke, will remain in Zou to defend it. The third group, led by Luffy, Nami, Chopper, Brook and Pekoms, will retrieve Sanji, who is being held prisoner by Big Mom. As for the last group, led by Kinemon, Law and Zoro, they will go to the land of Wa to establish a strategy while waiting for the others to join them. To undertake such projects, they would need to use a snail phone to communicate, but the Samurai of the Land of Wa and the people of Zou don\u0027t have one. However, Robin informs them that she has spotted a snailophone in the wild in the forest, and Franky announces that he will be able to configure it as a communication device.\n\nMeanwhile, Luffy runs triumphantly towards Pekoms\u0027 house, which had collapsed following Jack\u0027s attack. He looks for him and pulls the Mink out from under the rubble. The Straw Hat notices that Pekoms had taken on his turtle form to withstand the shock thanks to his shell. Luffy discovers his gifts and Pekoms explains that he had eaten the Kame Kame no Mi, otherwise known as the Fruit of the Turtle, which enables its user to have a shell as hard as diamond. Luffy is not impressed by this revelation and it irritates Pekoms. However, under the pretext that Chopper had to look after him, Luffy covers Pekoms in bandages and, once the Mink has been immobilized, takes him with him on his back, telling him that he was going to come with them to Big Mom\u0027s house. For his part, Pedro will be part of the trip after asking Nekomamushi for permission to leave with Luffy\u0027s group. After accepting his request, many other Minks also volunteered for the crossing. But Nekomamushi\u0027s verdict is final: only Pedro can accompany the pirates, as he is the only one capable of mastering Pekoms.\n\nFar from these concerns, Nami tests her new climatic wand, made by Usopp with Franky\u0027s help. The ends of this weapon can extend very far if activated. But Usopp advises her to master it. Nami does so, but not without causing a few disasters that make Raizou think he\u0027s dealing with an advanced form of Ninjutsu. Just as his friend is about to tell him the amount of his new wand, the young sailor magically disappears with a Mirage Tempo. Later, at Zou\u0027s front door, the entire team tasked with finding Sanji is about to leave, and each member bids farewell to their friends. Luffy suddenly stretches out his arms and \u0022traps\u0022 his companions in his embrace before leaping out of Zou, before the astonished eyes of their friends remaining on the island, towards the Thousand Sunny moored below!\n\nMeanwhile, back in Alabasta, Princess Vivi, accompanied by her faithful Kaloo and Chaka, is about to embark on a ship. She tells her father how happy she is to be setting sail at last...",

        "description": "The people of Alabasta greet the royal family as they set sail for Marie-Joie. On shore, Toto wonders about Vivi\u0027s enthusiasm, and his son Kohza replies that it must be the princess\u0027s pirate tendencies resurfacing. In the navy ship escorting the royal family, Hina reports to the World Government that she will see to it that the Nefertari Family arrives safely at Marie-Joie. Meanwhile, Vivi enjoys the sea breeze from the top of the mast, much to the chagrin of Igaram, who is terrified that something bad might happen to her. Savoring the immensity of the sea, Vivi recalls her adventures with the Crew of the Straw Hat when the latter was in his kingdom battling the odious Crocodile.\nOn deck, Igaram continues to watch Vivi from the top of the mast. He fears for the young princess\u0027s life, but is reassured by Pell, who reminds him that Vivi is very experienced at sea. For his part, Chaka asks Cobra to take it easy after he starts coughing in his wheelchair. He also reminds him that a return to Alabasta is still an option if the King isn\u0027t feeling well. However, the latter refused, telling him that he\u0027d been wanting to ask the World Government about the Poneglyphs ever since he\u0027d met Nico Robin. Suddenly, Vivi, without warning, jumps from the top of the mast, giving Igaram a huge fright, and asks her father if he\u0027s all right. The latter replied that he wondered how much longer he had to live, knowing that his daughter was still unmarried. He also points out that there are many photos of suitors in the palace, but Vivi replies that she doesn\u0027t need them and that he could throw them away.\n\nAt the same time, in Loguetown, two servants welcome Stelly, the new king of the Kingdom of Goa, and his wife Sally Nantuckanet to a hotel specially set up for royal families traveling to the Reverie, which takes place every four years. While the queen seems rather cheerful and remarks that she\u0027d seen worse, the new sovereign finds nothing special about this hotel other than the view overlooking Gol D.\u0027s scaffold. Roger\u0027s scaffold. As the two servants wish him a pleasant stay, he orders them to leave without delay, as he doesn\u0027t want any garbage near him. Like Vivi and her father Cobra, the leaders of over 50 countries have been invited to La R\u00eaverie and are currently en route to Marie-Joie. There, they will discuss the current state of the world and prepare plans for the future. However, peaceful discussion between the various heads of state is often a difficult thing to achieve. At the same time, in the Land of Ka, in West Blue, an influential notable had noticed that Don Chinjao and his grandson Sai had still not returned, even though the war against Doflamingo was long over. A useful hiccup, since they were unlikely to arrive in time for the R\u00eaverie, and there were many points he needed to discuss with them.\n\nNot far away, in the depths of the sea, in Ryugu Kingdom, Shirahoshi is frightened and refuses to go to Marie-Joie, saying that Luffy had promised to come back and take her to visit a real forest on dry land. While her brothers explain that it wasn\u0027t necessary for her to come, Neptune tries to reason with his daughter that if she didn\u0027t make the trip, it could be seen as a lack of trust in humans. To force Shirahoshi\u0027s hand, Fukaboshi reminds his sister that the summit was their late mother\u0027s dream and convinces her to come with them.\n\nIn the New World, Luffy gives orders to his crew, who are not very reactive following their dazzling departure from Zunesha\u0027s back. The only person left fit and well on the ship seems to be Carrot, who has sneaked in, much to everyone\u0027s surprise...",

        "description": "Everyone on the Sunny is surprised to discover Carrot, and Pedro asks her what she\u0027s doing on board. She simply replies that she wanted to travel with them. Pedro is annoyed and wonders if they can still return to Zou, despite Carrot\u0027s pleas and fear of Wanda\u0027s wrath. The young Mink then tries to justify herself by saying she just wanted to go on an adventure and adds, after raving about the beauty of the sea, that she had brought something to eat by opening her bag full of carrots. Pedro tries to reason with her, pointing out that this wasn\u0027t a simple expedition and that they were going to infiltrate the headquarters of a Yonkou. Moreover, contrary to Carrot\u0027s expectations, their journey could take several days to reach Big Mom\u0027s lair. However, Luffy accepts her and says she only has to protect herself, while eating one of his carrots. Carrot sees this and is deeply irritated by eating her food. She lunges at the Straw Hat, tackles Luffy to the ground and bites him savagely. Luffy manages to calm her down and Carrot, appeased, agrees to let him eat her vegetable. For his part, Pedro, perched at the top of the mast, recognizes that she\u0027s quite strong. As for Nami, she insists that something must be done and that everyone must do something: Luffy takes on the responsibility of cooking, which frightens his comrades.\nMeanwhile, in Sakura Kingdom, another king is on his way to the Reverie: Dalton. Dalton is astonished by Dr. Kureha\u0027s request to travel with him as ship\u0027s doctor. Kureha congratulates Dalton on rebuilding the country. Then, while contemplating Dr. Hiluluk\u0027s pavilion, she recalls Chopper\u0027s encounter with this charlatan, and the little reindeer\u0027s determination to save his friend by bringing him an Amiudake, a poisonous mushroom. She also recalls Luffy\u0027s battle with Wapol and Chopper\u0027s departure to join the Straw Hats. In the present, Dalton asks Kureha if her farewell to Chopper was too light. She replies that she didn\u0027t like crying, but as she says this, tears start to fall from her eyes. For his part, Dalton tries to guess what Chopper is up to now, as he must be swarming the seas. Meanwhile, in his new kingdom, Wapol, in the company of his wife, Miss Universe, is jubilant. He explains that he was propelled far away by Luffy before landing on an island where he had eaten everything. The Navy then arrested him before he escaped, but he was caught and condemned to sell matches in the snow. Reduced to the most terrible poverty, Wapol used everything he had ingested to make toys that won the hearts of all children. The metal used for this, Wapometal, was a fruitful discovery for local scientists, and the former ruler of the Kingdom of Drum turned it to his advantage by founding the Baku Baku Factory. Wapol went on to success and marriage with Miss Universe. In the present, one of his advisors informs him that the Kingdom of Drum has become \u0022Kingdom Sakura\u0022 and that its new king, Dalton, has left for Reverie. Wapol wonders how he can prevent Dalton from attending this royal meeting.\n\nAt the same time, in Dressrosa, several children wear straw hats in honor of Luffy, and play in the streets shouting \u0022Luffyland\u0022, a spectacle that amuses Kyros. The latter, while admiring the statue of Lucy, recalls with emotion how Luffy was able to put an end to Doflamingo\u0027s tyranny. Not far away, at the Palais Royal under reconstruction, Rebecca offers to accompany Viola to the R\u00eaverie as lady-in-waiting, but wonders what dress she\u0027s going to wear. Her aunt tells her she can borrow one of hers, and Rebecca, in the company of her friend Princess Mansherry, admires Viola\u0027s wardrobe, but prefers to wear one of her mother\u0027s dresses. As for the King of Prodence, Elizabello II, he suggests to Riku, via snail phone, that he comes with him to the R\u00eaverie, but Rebecca\u0027s grandfather doesn\u0027t see the point.\n\nMeanwhile, aboard the Thousand Sunny, Luffy starts cooking and discovers the abundance of food stored in Sanji\u0027s galley. For his part, Brook shows Carrot around the ship: the aquarium bar, the libraries, the bathroom and Nami\u0027s mandarin trees. Meanwhile, comfortably installed in the crow\u0027s nest, Pedro receives a newspaper revealing that the Revolutionary Army\u0027s headquarters on Baltigo have been discovered and destroyed by the Navy...",

        "description": "While Luffy does his best in the Sunny\u0027s kitchens, haphazardly chopping food without knowing what he was doing, Chopper checks on Pekoms to see what stage his injury has reached. Meanwhile, Pedro, still holding his diary, jumps down from the lookout and asks Chopper to call Luffy, as the situation is serious. The little reindeer complies, and Luffy\u0027s face is full of surprise when he reads the newspaper\u0027s headline: the headquarters of the Revolutionary Army have been located! The Straw Hat is worried about Sabo\u0027s fate and discovers for the first time the appearance of his father, Monkey D. Dragon, whom he had met two years earlier in Loguetown. Nami grabs the newspaper and starts reading. She informs her friends that the location of the Revolutionary Army\u0027s headquarters has been discovered by an anonymous person, and when the Navy and Cipher Pol arrived on the scene, Blackbeard\u0027s crew had already ravaged everything. The young sailor wondered why Teach\u0027s crew had done such a thing. Luffy, for his part, remembers that before Sabo left Dressrosa, he had defeated Jesus Burgess, and perhaps that\u0027s why Blackbeard\u0027s crew retaliated by ruthlessly hunting down the Revolutionary Army. However, Luffy is still worried about Sabo. Pedro reassures him that his death was mentioned in the newspaper and assumes that he is still alive, as is Dragon, the young pirate\u0027s father. For the time being, the team in charge of finding Sanji must survive at all costs if they are to reach Whole Cake Island safely, where their friend is being held prisoner, while facing a terrible storm and the clumsiness of the Straw Hat, who had unintentionally set fire to the kitchen of the Thousand Sunny, forgetting to turn off the oven he had left on. Nami takes the helm firmly and orders her companions to bring in the sails to prevent them being torn away by the storm. Everyone pitches in, including Brook, who has to face rough seas to accomplish his mission.\nAt the same time in Zou, Wanda learns from Bariete that he had been bribed by Carrot with bananas so that he wouldn\u0027t tell all the Minks that she had gone underground with Luffy\u0027s group. For his part, Duke Inuarashi warned his subjects to be very vigilant, as their enemies could return to their island if they held a Life Card. Meanwhile, underwater, a short distance from Zou, trapped under the wreckage of his ship, Jack waits impatiently for someone to fish him out and save his life. Meanwhile, somewhere in the New World, in an unknown, snowy land, Kaido is drinking. One of his subordinates tells him of Jack\u0027s abject failure in his vain attempt to free Doflamingo. Kaido suddenly begins to cry, thinking that he\u0027ll never be able to use his Gifters again. He then feels sorry for the \u0022Joker\u0022, even though it was his fault that he was defeated. But all the Emperor\u0027s hatred is focused on Luffy and Trafalgar Law. His tears, falling on them, tear the latter\u0027s bounty to shreds. A subordinate is about to tell him about Luffy and Law, in case he underestimates them, but it\u0027s at this word that Kaido loses his temper and ejects two of his men from the island in one fell swoop. With an air of menace, he tells the rest of his crew that these new-generation pirates think they\u0027re strong because they\u0027ve simply defeated Doflamingo, whereas they\u0027re nothing in his eyes. Kaido then addresses Eustass Kid, a prisoner in a cell, wounded and with a dark look on his face. He tells Kid to inform the pirates of his generation to flee as soon as possible, or they will not survive his wrath.\n\nNot far away, on a snow-covered sea, the Sunny\u0027s occupants are safe and sound and have managed to repair the damage caused by the storm. To satisfy his friends\u0027 hunger, Luffy proudly shows them the dish he had cooked, which turns out to be absolutely disgusting: there\u0027s rotten fish, uncooked rice and even unknown substances. Everyone tries to eat the dish, but Nami can\u0027t take it anymore and decides to go to the storeroom to see if there\u0027s anything else she can get her hands on. She discovers, to her horror, that there was no food left on their boat, as Luffy had missed his dish several times and had used up all the supplies to concoct a memorable meal for his friends. His friends are furious with him, while Brook begs for Sanji\u0027s return and Carrot screams for food...",

        "description": "Short of food, the crew of the Sunny are in dire straits. The situation takes a catastrophic turn when Luffy, in the grip of insatiable hunger, attacks Chopper and devours him. The little reindeer owes his life to Nami, who has stunned the Straw Hat with her climatic stick. They all despair and fear that they will not be able to accomplish their mission. Suddenly, a cry rings out from the lookout post. Pedro, at the top of the mast, had spotted an island on the horizon. This news spurs Luffy and his friends on, but Pekoms warns them against landing on this island, revealing to his companions that it is a Navy base where pirates are not welcome.\nDespite this danger, Luffy decides to go anyway. Leaving Pedro and Pekoms to guard their ship, he embarks with Brook, Nami, Chopper and Carrot aboard the Shark Submerge III, with the aim of stealing food from the Navy and returning quickly to Sunny undetected. The mission proves dangerous, however, as Pekoms tells us that the base is staffed exclusively by hotheads from the ranks of the Navy, who are responsible for guarding Whole Cake Island. As a result, even docking there can be complicated. Nami finds this out when she uses the submarine\u0027s periscope to discover that the base is heavily protected and virtually impregnable. Nevertheless, the small group has a plan. Just as the pirates are about to board, a violent altercation breaks out between a young Navy recruit and the soldiers based on the island, much to the dismay of Vice-Admiral Prody, Commander-in-Chief of the Isle of Fron Navy base. The assailant, Grant, deliberately attacks a ship trying to enter the base, and manages to single-handedly dispose of the entire crew before Prody\u0027s stunned eyes, who harbor a tenacious hatred for the young officer.\n\nMeanwhile, the young pirates have managed to land on the Isle of Fron. Using his gifts, Brook neutralizes a few soldiers so that his friends can put on their uniforms and pass unnoticed inside the base. Luffy is very reluctant to put on such clothes, but hunger grips his stomach. As Brook returns to the submarine to guard it, Nami, Chopper, Carrot and Luffy take advantage of the commotion caused by Grant\u0027s attack to enter the base. Using binoculars stolen from the guards, Nami hatches a plan with Chopper, but suddenly notices that Luffy and Carrot have slipped away to enter the base in the wrong direction. At the same time, Prody is deep in conversation with Garp, shouting all his rage at him. He tells him that Grant had destroyed a ship for him, but Luffy\u0027s grandfather is unconcerned by the carnage and explains to his colleague that Grant had wanted to be transferred to Prody\u0027s base, a choice that comes as a great surprise to Kobby, who doesn\u0027t understand why his comrade wanted to go to such a remote place.\n\nSummoned to Prody\u0027s office, Grant confesses that his greatest project is nothing less than defeating Big Mom. An ambition that astonishes Prody, who believes Grant doesn\u0027t have the shoulders to take down an emperor. Reading his file, Prody learns that Grant had been promoted to captain at the age of 17 and had served under Aokiji before the latter left the Navy after the terrible battle atop Marineford. Grant loses his temper when he hears Prody insult his former instructor, but is held back by two guards.\n\nOutside the base, guided by her unerring sense of smell and accompanied by the increasingly hungry Luffy, Carrot is not far from the food supplies and the two of them enter the Navy headquarters. However, the place is under surveillance. Chopper and Nami, who had followed their friends, also realize this. Not far away, Grant enters the mess hall, where he does not go unnoticed. Attacking the soldiers at the table, he has a run-in with one of them, who turns out to be a friend of his: Bonam. Their reunion is touching, and Grant discovers that his other friend Zappa was nearby. He sees him crying his eyes out because the last woman on the base refused to marry him. While Bonam and Grant went to their friend to cheer him up, Carrot and Luffy, still in disguise, enjoyed a hot meal. At the same time, in the thicket, guards equipped with torches discover soldiers stripped of their uniforms and tied up against a tree. They immediately raise the alarm.\n\nA soldier reports the news of this intrusion to Vice-Admiral Prody, who is stunned to learn that a ghost has attacked his men and stolen their uniforms. He orders his men to cordon off the base in search of the intruders. Nearby, in the mess hall, Grant dines with his friends while Luffy and Carrot feast. Nami and Chopper spot them and fear that one of the officers will discover them. However, hunger takes hold of their stomachs and they too succumb. They are then surprised by the cook who, mistaking them for new recruits, invites them to dinner, much to their delight. At the same time, in the surveillance room, Prody goes to get the news and discovers that the search is still on for the intruders. The intruders are still stuffing their faces, and suddenly Carrot spots Nami and Chopper and calls them by name, oblivious to the Navy soldiers surrounding her. The young sailor beckoned Carrot to be quiet, but the damage was done. Indeed, Zappa forgot his sadness when he heard Nami\u0027s name, which was unfamiliar to him. He recognized her in spite of her disguise and wondered what she was doing in this Navy base.\n\nAbandoning Grant and Bonam, who don\u0027t understand what\u0027s happening to him, Zappa rushes up to Nami and tells her he\u0027s recognized her. The distraught young woman tells him he\u0027s made a mistake and that her real name is Mina. But Zappa doesn\u0027t believe her and, to prove his point, pulls out an engraved wanted poster in his coat. Nami is disturbed to realize that this soldier had fallen in love with her just by staring at her portrait day and night. Zappa tries to persuade Nami to marry him, but she refuses. Just as he\u0027s about to kiss Nami, Zappa discovers she\u0027s gone, and learns from the cook that the young woman has run away. Stunned by this news, Zappa meets up with his friends and cries that he\u0027s been spurned again. For her part, Nami is overjoyed to have finally got rid of that clingy officer, while Luffy, still hungry, had grabbed a huge pot of curry under the noses of the soldiers who had come to help themselves.\n\nMeanwhile, in the surveillance room, Prody is losing patience. One of his subordinates tries to calm him down by telling him that an argument is going on in the refectory. Intrigued, Prody orders one of his men to zoom in on the individual who was the cause of the argument and recognizes, to his horror, the face of Monkey D. Garp\u0027s grandson! Prody sounded the general alarm and informed his men that he had discovered the intruder, who was currently stuffing his face with curry in the cafeteria! All the soldiers in the mess hall watch Luffy eating as if nothing had happened, and begin to surround him at gunpoint. Next to him, Carrot takes little notice and asks the Straw Hat to leave, while Nami and Chopper have already left to go to the storeroom to steal food. Not far away, Brook, disguised as a soldier, heard the sirens and waited patiently for his friends on the Shark Submerge III, wondering if they were all right, not caring that soldiers had gone to look for their boat. In the cafeteria, Grant has heard Luffy\u0027s name spoken by Prody and prepares to fight him, much to the latter\u0027s astonishment...",

Meanwhile, Grant and his cohorts are desperate to capture the Straw Hat and his friends. Instead of fleeing, Luffy and Carrot pounce on the food, oblivious to the many guns pointed at them. All they think about is eating and filling their stomachs. Baited by his bounty and underestimating his abilities, Grant lunges at Luffy to attack him. The latter defends himself as best he can, using as a weapon the ladle he had used to draw food from the pot.\nMeanwhile, outside the base, patrols armed to the teeth are looking for Nami and Chopper. They wonder whether their companions have managed to escape their pursuers. The young sailor takes advantage of the commotion to steal supplies from the Navy to continue their journey to Whole Cake Island. To do this, they make their way to the food stores, but the door leading to them is carefully locked. Meanwhile, in the base cafeteria, the fight between Grant and Luffy continues. The two fighters clash fiercely, but the Straw Hat proves stronger than the young naval officer. Now it\u0027s Bonam\u0027s turn to fight the pirate, using his powers to tear apart the interior of the cafeteria. Thanks to his agility, Luffy manages to avoid the attacks of this member of the Long-Arm tribe, and the captain of the Straw Hat Crew manages to defeat him using the Jet Pistol. Luffy and Carrot manage to get out of the cafeteria, but are caught by Zappa, who coaxes young Mink with a bunch of carrots, his favorite dish. Instead of a trap, Zappa had literally fallen in love with Carrot. But when Luffy asks him to find the rest of his companions, Grant\u0027s deputy gets angry and challenges Luffy to a duel. Luffy defends himself using the Combative Fluid, while Carrot shortens their fight by electrocuting Zappa, apologizing for having previously offered him carrots. After this incident, Luffy and Carrot resume their race but are stopped by Brook\u0027s \u0022scepter\u0022, which informs them that Nami and Chopper have discovered the warehouse where the island\u0027s food was stored. They follow Brook as they themselves are pursued by Grant, Bonam and Zappa, who are out for revenge.\n\nAs they try to find their way out, Navy soldiers block their path. Luffy neutralizes them using the powers of his Demon Fruit. Other soldiers appear at the bend in the corridor, and it\u0027s Carrot\u0027s turn to show what she\u0027s capable of. She electrocutes her attackers so that she and her friends can quickly reach the outside of the base. However, Brook leads Luffy and Carrot into a dead end where they find themselves trapped. As they try to turn back, they are overtaken by Grant and Bonam, who are ready for battle. But they suddenly start bickering as Zappa arrives. Luffy takes advantage of this moment to drill a hole in the wall using his Haki and invites Carrot and Brook to follow him, leaving the three stunned naval officers in their wake. The latter watch as the pirates, guided by Luffy\u0027s unerring sense of smell, run towards the food stocks on the Isle of Fron.\n\nAs they come within sight of the warehouse, Brook abandons them to return to their submarine. Luffy lets him go and forces open the hangar door to improvise a feast with Carrot and Chopper. Nami arrives just then and is annoyed to see her captain so relaxed about eating. Chopper agrees with her and advises Luffy to flee as quickly as possible, taking as much food as possible with them. Just as they\u0027re about to do so, they\u0027re surprised by Grant and his comrades. The young officer hasn\u0027t forgotten Luffy\u0027s affront in the cafeteria and is ready to face him again. Bonam and Zappa join him and help him fight the pirates. The pirates don\u0027t let up, however, and take on their opponents in a fierce and epic battle. Chopper has to fight Bonam, who has the ability to transform his body with ease. Despite this inconvenience, the little reindeer manages to defeat his assailant. This defeat doesn\u0027t stop the Navy officers, however, as Zappa confronts Luffy under the pretext of having stolen Nami and Carrot\u0027s hearts by being their captain. The Mink and the young sailor take care of this nuisance, first by electrocuting him, then by subjecting him to the wrath of the climatic stick.\n\nBut this doesn\u0027t faze Zappa, who rises to his feet as if nothing had happened. Still determined to have Nami and Carrot as his wives, he unleashes a tornado of fire against Luffy, which the Straw Hat manages to deflect by turning it into a torrent of water. The tumultuous waves carry the pirates and their precious sacks of victuals out of the food warehouse, but they are soon followed by Grant, who still wishes to confront the Straw Hat. A third battle begins between Grant and Luffy, but the latter proves to be a stronger opponent than Grant. Biting the dust, Grant doesn\u0027t concede defeat and once again sets out to attack Straw Hat, teaching him of his irrepressible hatred for pirates and the Four Emperors. Running towards Luffy, the latter overcomes his adversary with a powerful punch to the gut that nails Grant to the spot, much to the astonishment of Bonam and Zappa, who witness the scene.\n\nOn their way back to the submarine, Luffy and his friends come face to face with Vice-Admiral Prody, who has been waiting for them with his men, intent on arresting them. A confrontation is inevitable when the commander of the Isle of Fron, ready to clear his base\u0027s name, aims a bazooka at the pirates. This situation does not disarm Luffy, who is ready to do battle with the Navy\u0027s elite...",

He tells them that they won\u0027t be able to get out of his base, which is on the front line against Big Mom, alive. He will therefore make it a point of honor to eliminate them to honor his reputation and enjoy a well-deserved retirement. Chopper is astonished by this admission, while Nami had spotted their submarine nearby.\nAs Brook waves to Nami aboard the submarine, Prody grabs a huge bazooka and aims it at the living skeleton before firing. A dazzling explosion lights up the night, and Brook watches in horror as a huge fireball crashes down on him. His companions, who had witnessed the attack, realized that Prody had destroyed the submarine with Brook inside! After using his weapon, the Fron Island base commander tells the pirates that he had already used this bazooka when fighting Garp, Luffy\u0027s grandfather! Prody then set his sights on the Straw Hat, but the latter, having realized what he was up to, grabbed Chopper and Nami to get them out of the way. For her part, Carrot had escaped on her own, and the four of them found themselves facing the Navy soldiers.\n\nRecovering from her emotions, Nami grabs her climatic wand to electrocute her enemies at the same time as Carrot, but their attack doesn\u0027t work. Indeed, Prody\u0027s men were equipped with shields whose surface was covered with rubber, a material insensitive to electricity. However, this little inconvenience doesn\u0027t embarrass Chopper, who neutralizes his assailants using his kung-fu skills before Prody\u0027s astonished eyes. For her part, Nami has not said her last word and uses mirages to attack the Navy soldiers, while Carrot stuns a large number of enemies in his path. Filled with rage, Prody again aims his bazooka at Luffy, launching several salvos which he avoids with ease.\n\nMeanwhile, outside the food store on Fron Island, Bonam, Zappa and Grant see the lights of Prody\u0027s attacks in the distance. Bonam is ready to go to the scene immediately, but Grant refuses to accompany them. He confesses that he feels weak and useless. Bonam doesn\u0027t believe him and hits him hard to restore his friend\u0027s legendary energy, but it\u0027s no use. Seeing that he couldn\u0027t bend him, he left him to his own devices and went off to fight the pirates with Zappa. Before leaving Grant, Zappa advises his friend to remember Admiral Aokiji\u0027s last words to them. This upsets Grant, who takes refuge in his memories.\n\nNot far away, on the battlefield, Luffy confronts the Navy troops without faltering and succeeds in neutralizing Prody under the admiring gaze of his friends. Believing the game won, they suddenly see Bonam and Zappa ready to do battle with them. The warrior of the Long-Armed Tribe uses his powers to strike at his opponents, while his colleague grabs his swords and lets out chilling laughter at the pirates. While his comrades battle Luffy, Grant recalls his first encounter with ex-Admiral Aokiji, when he was fitted with a large arm with hooked fingers. Aokiji rescued him using his icy powers and cured his deformity by building him a bionic arm. After this incident, he trained in Marineford with Bonam and Zappa, where he was taught by Aokiji to control his powers on the battlefield. Having understood his master\u0027s wise words, Grant hurried off to join his comrades, who were in dire straits against Luffy. Indeed, the Straw Hat has got the better of Bonam and Zappa, who quickly bite the dust as his friends look on in amazement.\n\nHaving triumphed over his enemies, Luffy and his companions, who have managed to retrieve their sacks of victuals, are about to leave the island. They are surprised to find that Brook has escaped without a scratch and that their submarine is intact. However, Luffy has to face Grant once again, who doesn\u0027t want the pirates to leave the island as easily as they entered it. A new battle ensues between the Straw Hat and the ambitious naval officer. Witnessing the duel, Bonam and Zappa are pleased that Grant has changed his mind. He tells them that all will be well and that he will fight Luffy only with his left arm.\n\nIn a fit of uncontrollable rage, Grant explodes his prosthesis, revealing an enormous hairy arm and a hand with hooked, pointed fingers. The sight of this prodigy frightens everyone except Luffy, who is ready to fight his opponent. Inviting his friends to board the submarine with their precious cargo, the Straw Hat once again faces Grant in single combat. After getting rid of his annoying Marine coat, Luffy once again stands up to his opponent, who attacks first. Grant lunges forward and, armed with his hooked arm, attempts to disembowel the young pirate alive, but he doesn\u0027t let go. The latter avoids his attack and tries to strike at his target. But he misses. Luffy is on the verge of surrendering when he decides to use the Gear Third to confront Grant. Violently inflating his right arm, Luffy fights like a madman, unleashing the elements around him. However, the Straw Hat and Grant are of equal strength. Seeing that the only way to defeat Grant was to use the Elephant Gun, Luffy used this technique and succeeded in neutralizing and knocking out his opponent with a lightning-fast punch, despite Prody\u0027s pleas to see his dreams of retirement go up in smoke.\n\nThe sun rises over a beach littered with Navy soldiers. Grant is still unconscious, but is awakened by Bonam and Zappa, who are pleased to see that their friend has survived. When the latter asks them where Luffy was, he learns that he had already left. This news angers him, but Bonam manages to calm Grant down by promising that one day they\u0027ll capture the Straw Hat. For their part, he and his friends manage to leave the Isle of Fron safely aboard the Thousand Sunny. Everyone is happy to be back at sea, but Nami realizes that Pedro and Pekoms have gobbled up their entire food supply in an instant, and this infuriates her. Luffy, who had also taken part in the feast, reassures her that all will be well, while Grant, Bonam and Zappa watch the Sunny disappear over the horizon...",

        "description": "As the Sunny finds itself tossed about in stormy seas and on the verge of capsizing, hunger and fatigue grip all the ship\u0027s passengers, even Nami, who struggles to stay on course in the storm. However, Luffy, still determined to find Sanji, tries with all his might to keep sailing. At the same time, on a snowy sea that is in fact a shower of cotton candy, Sanji is aboard the Singing Ship, Big Mom\u0027s crew ship, in the company of Baron Tamago, entering the latter\u0027s territories. The cook of the Chapeau de Paille crew sees Tarte 28, a huge watchtower in charge of spotting intruding ships. Tamago tries to persuade Sanji to join Big Mom\u0027s crew and swear allegiance to Germa 66, but Sanji refuses. He then tries to coax his host by revealing that Big Mom is in a rather more welcoming mood than usual, and that she may well appreciate him for his cooking skills. Just then, Vito arrives and shows him a photo of Sanji\u0027s bride. When Sanji looks at the photo, he immediately falls under the spell of the beautiful Lady Charlotte Pudding, Big Mom\u0027s thirty-fifth daughter.\nAfter this incident, the entire crew of the Singing Ship is busy preparing presents for Big Mom. As for Sanji, he wanders around the deck, trying to ignore Vito who is following him around, asking him if he liked Pudding\u0027s photo. Sanji\u0027s response is to remain silent. To cheer him up, Vito tells him about Sora, the Sea Warrior, a comic-book hero who appears in the World Economic Journal. According to Tamago\u0027s second-in-command, he often battles Germa 66, who is considered the villain of the story. He also claims that this is an educational way of propagandizing the Navy, but that the Germa are always portrayed as formidable adversaries, which is true in reality. Sanji gets angry with Vito after noticing him following him everywhere, even into his room, where Caesar Clown was locked in a cage. But the Straw Hat cook\u0027s behavior is not to the liking of Vito\u0027s teammate Gotti, who becomes violently angry. He is, however, put in his place by a mysterious woman who bears an uncanny resemblance to Laura, and who turns out to be his superior, as she forbids him to make any attempt on the life of their \u0022guest\u0022 because he is a Vinsmoke. She suddenly takes Gotti\u0027s ear and leads him outside, threatening to deprive him of his meal. For his part, Vito decides to join them and leaves Sanji behind, while Caesar panics at the thought of being killed by Big Mom and envies Sanji\u0027s place.\n\nA few days later, the Sunny crosses an arid zone and the team in charge of finding Sanji suffers from the heat and lack of water. Short of food since Luffy\u0027s failed culinary experiment, he tries to make up for it by fishing with Brook, Pedro and Chopper. Suddenly, he notices something biting at his fishing rod. In fact, a very large fish is swimming in the water, which is boiling hot due to the heat. Encouraged by his comrades in misfortune, the Straw Hat puts all his strength into catching the fish and succeeds, much to everyone\u0027s delight.\n\nMeanwhile, on a mist-covered sea, a mysterious hooded woman says she\u0027s looking forward to Sanji\u0027s return. Her interlocutor, with an equally masked face, replies that he\u0027s as impatient as she is...",

At any moment, Luffy is in danger of going overboard, but his friends manage to hold him back aboard the Sunny. Le Chapeau de Paille continues to fight with his prey, using all his strength with his fishing rod to tire it out. Soon, his efforts are rewarded and Luffy manages to hoist the huge fish onto the ship\u0027s deck to everyone\u0027s delight. Chopper, however, is suspicious of the catch and goes rummaging in Sanji\u0027s locker for his fish encyclopedia. The Straw Hat Crew\u0027s doctor discovers that the flesh and skin of this fish are extremely toxic. He runs to warn his comrades of the danger, but helplessly sees Luffy stuffing his face. However, to Chopper\u0027s astonishment, Luffy feels better and is even ready to cook the fish he has just caught. But Nami intervenes and, remembering her captain\u0027s poor culinary skills, decides to cook the fish herself, using a recipe from Sanji. Everyone is delighted to be able to satisfy their hunger at last.\nAs Nami takes a plate back to Chopper to regain his strength, she finds him at Luffy\u0027s bedside, lying on the deck and shivering with cold. She realizes that Luffy has fallen victim to the poison, and that Chopper could do nothing to save his friend as he had run out of medicinal herbs. To make matters worse, according to Pekoms, Thousand Sunny is already in Big Mom\u0027s territory. He advises them to hide or disguise themselves to avoid being caught. However, underwater sensors have detected their presence, and Brook is surprised to hear their snail phone ringing when he wasn\u0027t expecting a call. As they navigate these waters in a thick fog of cotton candy clouds, the crew come across the Germa 66 ship, which has a giant snailophone as its figurehead, while Luffy\u0027s condition continues to worsen: he is in dire need of an antidote if he is to be saved.\n\nTo everyone\u0027s astonishment, the crew of this unfamiliar ship recognize the Straw Hats\u0027 boat and ask what they\u0027re doing there. However, Nami notices that the Sunny is getting dangerously close to the other ship and could collide with them. She orders her comrades to hoist the sails before taking the helm for an evasive maneuver. As Chopper stands at the top of the mast, he is struck dumb by the sight of a hooded man who bears a striking resemblance to Sanji. He jumps to the deck, shouting his name. He is soon followed by his friends, who are relieved to have finally found their missing comrade. Taking advantage of this reunion, Chopper explains to Sanji his situation, telling him that Luffy had eaten a toxic poison and was in danger of dying soon. The little reindeer ended up asking him if he had an antidote on board his ship. Hearing the name Sanji repeated several times, the man in the hood breaks his silence and, annoyed, reveals to the crew that his real name is Yonji, not Sanji. He doesn\u0027t blame them for the mistake, however, as many people often mistake him for Sanji because of their uncanny resemblance!\n\nChopper is totally bewildered by this revelation, for the man in front of him really is the spitting image of Sanji. He even has the Black Leg\u0027s spiral eyebrows. For Chopper, the man can only be their friend. But Yonji retorts that his relationship with Sanji is confidential and must remain secret from the Straw Hats. Nami thinks Sanji has a little brother, while Carrot asks her how she came to this conclusion. From the top of his ship, Yongi stares intently at the young sailor and, as Sanji would have done, falls madly in love with her!\n\nThe Straw Hat crew\u0027s doctor persists in asking him if he really was Sanji, but Yonji replies that they had no reason to stay there. Chopper again calls him \u0022Sanji\u0022, which irritates Yonji, who repeats that his name is Yonji. Suddenly, Chopper is startled to notice a bluish rash covering Luffy\u0027s body. He is alarmed, thinking that the Straw Hat will be all right, as he is usually resistant to poisons thanks to his antibodies. At his side, Nami supports Luffy, telling him he\u0027s not going to die, as he must become King of the Pirates. For his part, the man in the hood openly refuses to help them, as he was not in the habit of treating the people he met. He is, however, severely reprimanded by his elder sister, Vinsmoke Reiju, who kicks him off the ship. However, Luffy\u0027s situation became increasingly worrying, and he grew weaker by the day, with no help from his friends. Suddenly, the mysterious stranger from the Germa 66 ship leaps from her boat and lands on the deck of the Sunny. Just as Carrot and his friends are ready to fight her, Reiju asks them to excuse his younger brother\u0027s hot-headed attitude...",

        "description": "Despite the distrust of Luffy\u0027s companions, Reiju is keen to apologize for her younger brother\u0027s appalling attitude towards them. He rises from the water in his flying shoes and insults his older sister for humiliating him in front of strangers. Brook is astonished by this prodigy, while Chopper thinks it\u0027s a gift inherited from a Demon Fruit. However, Pekoms, who knows Germa 66 well, explains that this organization derives its advantages from science. For his part, Brook recalls that the Vinsmoke Family is a royal family with advanced technology that once allowed them to rule all of North Blue. Reiju confirms the living skeleton\u0027s statement, adding that his family is still royal and often participates in the Reverie, even though they no longer have land to rule.\nAfter these brief introductions, Reiju approaches Luffy and almost immediately identifies the evil gnawing at his insides. The Straw Hat had absorbed the venom of a rock-armored fish from the Boiling Sea, and Sanji\u0027s big sister knows the way to save Luffy. She leans over him and kisses him greedily on the mouth to recover the venom, before the astonished eyes of the Sunny\u0027s crew and the impassive gaze of Yonji. Miraculously, this treatment works wonders, as the venom is completely absorbed by Reiju. As ship\u0027s doctor, Chopper doesn\u0027t understand what has happened. He asks her if she was feeling well. Reiju replies that she does, as her nickname is \u0022Poison Pink\u0022, and adds that she is able to suck the poison out of her body with a simple touch of the mouth, then pass it on to herself and consume it without suffering any ill effects from the poison. Faced with such a prodigy, Brook falls totally under the young woman\u0027s spell. Luffy wakes up soon afterwards and all his friends jump on him, crying with joy. Luffy says he was eating the fish and asks if he had fallen asleep. He just remembered that the skin of the fish was so good that he still wanted to taste it, which greatly upset Nami, who had feared for her captain\u0027s life.\n\nLuffy suddenly spots Reiju and thinks it\u0027s Sanji because of their resemblance. But Chopper immediately tells him that it was a woman who had saved his life. Grateful, the Straw Hat wants to know who she is. He then guesses that the young woman is Sanji\u0027s older sister, which Reiju confirms. She also adds that Sanji left his family at a very young age and that their father had always been looking for him. Two years ago, a wanted poster with a portrait that vaguely resembled him began to circulate. Their father sent Navy Headquarters after him, but it seems that the man on the APB was Duval. Brook adds that even Sanji was really upset about this mistake. When the World Government managed to take a more accurate photo, Sanji\u0027s father immediately raised the bounty and changed the terms of his son\u0027s capture from \u0022Dead or Alive\u0022 to \u0022Only Alive\u0022.\n\nAfter these revelations, Luffy asks Reiju if she knows where his brother is now. She tells him she doesn\u0027t know. Maybe he\u0027s with Big Mom or his father. She adds that they came to meet him, but it seems they got lost on the way. However, Luffy thanks Sanji\u0027s sister for saving him, but tells her what he wants now is to find Sanji, as he\u0027s his friend. For his part, Jonji observes the whole scene, wondering why his big sister had saved his enemy\u0027s life without thinking. Suddenly, he spots Pekoms on the deck of the Sunny and calls out to him. He asks him if he\u0027s really part of Big Mom\u0027s crew, and why he\u0027s now with the Straw Hats. Pekoms replies that he has his own reasons that he doesn\u0027t want to tell him.\n\nReiju then bids farewell to the occupants of the Thousand Sunny and leaps off in her flying shoes to join her younger brother, who hadn\u0027t moved. The young woman took one last look at the Straw Hats, informing them that she and Jonji had not seen them, so as not to cause trouble and prevent their brother\u0027s forthcoming wedding. After these recommendations, Yonji ordered his ship\u0027s crew to weigh anchor and continue on their way, before once again contemplating the wanted notice for Nami, with whom he had fallen madly in love. Soon, the Germa 66 ship disappears over the horizon, leaving Luffy and his companions behind, while underwater, unbeknownst to everyone, Aladdin reports to Jinbei that the Straw Hat is aboard his ship and asks him what he should do next.\n\nAfter the Germa 66s leave, Luffy gradually recovers, but Sunny\u0027s crew are still suffering from a severe food crisis. Pekoms reassures them by revealing that they are soon approaching an island where they will be able to stock up on supplies. Nami guesses that it\u0027s an island belonging to Big Mom\u0027s territory. The Mink Lion tells her she\u0027s right, and explains to her companions that Whole Cake is an island surrounded by an archipelago called Totland, and that it\u0027s made up of around 34 islands, each ruled by a minister. Suddenly, Carrot climbs the lookout to join Pedro, as she had seen another ship approaching them in the distance. Pekoms also sees this ship and tells his comrades that it\u0027s a scout ship in the pay of Big Mom. He advises them to hide in the cabin if they don\u0027t want to be captured. He would remain alone on deck to negotiate with the authorities. When they arrived on Cocoa Island, Pekoms managed to convince them that he had single-handedly captured the Sunny and was going to give it to Big Mom as a gift. Brook, Nami, Carrot and Pedro watch the whole scene without betraying their presence. Suddenly, Carrot notices that Luffy and Chopper are no longer aboard the Sunny. Nami guesses that they have disembarked and, driven by curiosity, wanted to explore the island. Indeed, the two young pirates venture into a town where they discover, to their astonishment, that everything is made of chocolate...",

Suddenly, the little reindeer sniffs a sweet smell that intrigues the Straw Hat. Soon, the two were running towards the place where Chopper had smelled the sweet smell. Meanwhile, on the Sunny, after Pekoms urges them to disguise themselves, Nami and Carrot change outfits. For his part, Brook tries to contemplate the underside of Nami\u0027s nude outfit, but she severely reprimands him with a violent punch. Pekoms tries to restore calm by reminding his friends not to linger too long on the island and to find food for the rest of their adventures. Indeed, they still need a day\u0027s sailing to reach Whole Cake Island, where Sanji is being held prisoner.\nCarrot is eager to discover the island and wants to get a glimpse of the town. To do so, he borrows Pedro\u0027s binoculars. Using them, the young Mink is first impressed by the ethnic diversity of the city: all species were represented, Humans, Fish-Men, Long-Arms, Long-Legs, Dwarves and even Minks! Pekoms explains that this is Big Mom\u0027s cosmopolitan dream: to create a multi-ethnic society where every race coexists in peace, without discrimination. Carrot notes the abundance of chocolate in the city and, much to Brook\u0027s delight, Pekoms explains that almost everything is edible, except for certain functional items such as roof tiles and street furniture. The Mink-Lion also explains that this is Chocolate Town, the capital of Cocoa Island, one of the thirty-four islands that make up the Totland Archipelago. With these words, the Nami, Carrot, Brook and Pedro set off to explore, with the exception of Pekoms, who had decided to keep the Sunny while they were away.\n\nOn Cacao Island, Nami\u0027s group soon track down Luffy and Chopper thanks to the commotion they\u0027ve caused: indeed, the two young pirates have been filling their bellies after eating at the Caf\u00e9 Caramel, a public place, which led to their arrest by Agent Chocolat. Absurdly, Luffy and Chopper retort that their excuse was that the building was too good. Suddenly, Caf\u00e9 Caramel owner Charlotte Pudding arrives on a flying carpet, accompanied by a slimy living thing on her shoulder. After learning the pirates\u0027 \u0022excuse\u0022, she lies to the agent: she makes him believe that the caf\u00e9 is soon to be demolished, and so she\u0027s asked them to take the opportunity to eat it. Unsuspecting, the policeman apologizes to everyone. Pedro, who had been observing the scene, is stopped by a Mink-Loup acquaintance who asks him what he\u0027s doing there. Pedro tells him he\u0027s on a secret mission and Nami takes the opportunity to question the Mink-Leopard, but the latter replies that he\u0027ll explain later.\n\nTo recover from her emotions, Pudding invites Luffy and her friends to her home, as she is flattered that they found Caf\u00e9 Caramel so delicious. Once settled in, the pirates savagely devour parts of Pudding\u0027s house. When Pudding asks them again if it was any good and receives an affirmative answer, she blushes. Pudding explains the steps of the Caf\u00e9 Caramel recipe, which she had lovingly cooked herself. While preparing a hot cup of tea, the caf\u00e9 owner asks for everyone\u0027s first name, and the Chapeau de Paille accidentally reveals his identity, causing Pudding to lose her smile, visibly worried after hearing her first name pronounced.\n\nNot far away, on an egg island, the population is panicking at the idea that Empress Big Mom has decided to organize another Tea Party, and the army assembles, ready to attack. The soldiers spot only one enemy, a mysterious woman in a large hat. On another flour island, a strange character sows chaos wherever he goes. And finally, on a fruit island, a humanoid rabbit is slicing up the population. At the same time, on Whole Cake Island, Big Mom is personally overseeing preparations for Sanji\u0027s wedding tea party in three days\u0027 time, knowing that a very special guest is already in her archipelago: the Straw Hat...",

Nami tries to reassure their host of their good intentions, but she panics, much to Pedro\u0027s dismay, who decides to silence her by threatening to slit her throat. The young sailor manages to calm the Mink-Leopard\u0027s ardor, while Pudding confesses.\nShe is indeed what she claims to be, Big Mom\u0027s 35th daughter, even though Big Mom already had thirty-nine daughters and forty-six sons, whom she forcibly married with the sole aim of strengthening her own crew. As fate would have it, however, e Pudding met Sanji and fell under his spell. Yet, despite his attraction to her, Sanji refused to marry her and said he had to give it up to continue his journey with his friends. She understood his decision and confessed to Luffy and his friends that she was very different from her mother. To prove her point, Pudding shows the crew the route they must follow to reach Whole Cake Island safely, a route known only to Big Mom\u0027s sons and which passes through various islands: Candy Island, Nuts Island, Jam Island and others. Suddenly, someone knocks on Pudding\u0027s door and everyone gets scared. They are soldiers from the guard who have come to escort the young woman to her forthcoming wedding. Pudding informs them that she still has some work to do, and uses this subterfuge to help the Straw Hats leave her house discreetly.\n\nMeanwhile, Sanji continues to be pursued by Vito, who is full of praise for the Germa 66\u0027s exploits. This adoration is starting to annoy Sanji, who is trying everything he can to lose him. Not far away, Sanji\u0027s two older brothers, who lead the Germa 66, land on Brock Colie Island to put an end to the hostilities ravaging this New World island with an impressive army of clones. At the same time, on Cocoa Island, the team in charge of finding Sanji is out shopping, lingering over the stalls displaying succulent chocolate delicacies. They return one day later aboard the Thousand Sunny to find that Pekoms, who was supposed to watch over the ship while they were away, has disappeared. Luffy and his companions begin searching the ship for him, without success. Suddenly, Chopper yells at them to come with him to Sunny\u0027s bathroom to read a message, written from the Mink: \u0022Turn back\u0022. But the Straw Hat, to everyone\u0027s amazement, ignores this warning and decides to continue their mission in spite of everything...",

An enemy, still alive, asks a Germa 66 leader how he dared attack his wife and children, before attempting to shoot him. At this point, the military leader says \u0022Wall\u0022 and a Germa soldier steps in between the bullet and his superior, sacrificing himself by protecting him in full view of his comrades. The Germa 66 leader then shoots the soldier dead, explaining that it had only taken him four hours to end a war that had lasted two years, and that he was in a hurry to attend his brother\u0027s wedding. He then joined his other brother, who had taken part in the expedition with his entire army to the cheers of the local army. The second military chief of Germa 66 asked his interlocutor by snail phone when Sanji\u0027s wedding would take place. The latter replied that it would be in three days\u0027 time, and that two days would be more than enough to reach Whole Cake Island from his position. Before hanging up, he adds that he can\u0027t wait to see Sanji again.\nAt the same time, after the disappearance of their guide Pekoms, Luffy\u0027s team has left Cocoa Island and is following Pudding\u0027s directions to reach Big Mom\u0027s lair. Le Chapeau de Paille is worried about their friend\u0027s fate, but Pedro advises them not to waste too much time and to continue sailing to Whole Cake Island. Suddenly, Chopper and Carrot smell something sweet in the ocean air. They are undoubtedly close to another island. This information is confirmed by Pedro who, from the lookout, sees an island covered with jam jars looming on the horizon. This is Jam Island, the next island on their route. However, Nami decides to go around it, as indicated on the map Charlotte Pudding had drawn for her. The young sailor explains to her friends that she is doing this to avoid being surprised by the enemy, which greatly saddens Chopper and Carrot, who were eager to linger on the island. Luffy comes up with the idea of cooking, but is overtaken by Nami, who doesn\u0027t want him to, given his poor culinary skills.\n\nThe team in charge of recovering Sanji then continues their navigation and arrives in an area where the water was the color of grapes. Pedro explains that Sunny is near the island that produces juice. Nami is astonished by such knowledge and remembers that Pedro had been accosted by a Mink-Loup who was a friend of his in Chocolate Town. Under the questioning gaze of his friends, Pedro is forced to confess that this is not the first time he has ventured into the Totland Archipelago. Suddenly, a violent tremor shakes the Thousand Sunny. Carrot noticed, terrified, that a horrible sea monster was attacking them. It\u0027s a Centipede Sea King, and it\u0027s back with a vengeance. He is quickly defeated by Luffy, who uses his powers to shoot him down. But a second sea monster, twice the size of the previous one, emerges from the water and is about to engulf the Straw Hat ship. Luffy doesn\u0027t want to hear of it, and uses his powers to inflict a crushing defeat on the second Sea King, before the astonished eyes of his friends.\n\nMeanwhile, on Whole Cake Island, Big Mom is suffering from a massive case of the munchies and calls for a croquembouche to soothe her hunger. Before the helpless eyes of her most loyal lieutenants, she pounces on the island\u0027s confectionery and ransacks Sweet City to the horror of its inhabitants, even going so far as to destroy her own castle by devouring it whole-heartedly while continuing to demand a croquembouche...",

The panic-stricken inhabitants of Sweet City flee in all directions to avoid being devoured by the Empress, who demands that she be served a Croquembouche immediately. Suddenly, the Minister of Gelato, Charlotte Muscat, Big Mom\u0027s sixteenth son, appears. He tries to calm his mother\u0027s fury, but to no avail. He asks Baron Tamago if the famous pastry is finally ready. Baron Tamago told him that there was only half an hour left for the Croquembouche to be baked. Muscat did all he could to gain time, but Big Mom, gripped by hunger, turned bloodshot eyes on her son and attacked him, robbing him of forty years of life before the horrified eyes of the people of Sweet City and his siblings, who soon watched helplessly as Muscat died.\nAfter committing her crime, Big Mom strides towards his castle with the aim of devouring it. Just when all seemed lost, Jinbei suddenly appears, swimming down a river of juice on the back of a huge whale shark. Beside him is a Croquembouche, a huge cake made of cream puffs, which he had managed to gather in a hurry. With a leap into the air, he forces it down Big Mom\u0027s throat. The latter, won over by this exquisite treat, instantly calms down, to the delight of the island\u0027s inhabitants and dignitaries, who immediately decree the reconstruction of Sweet City. After regaining her lucidity, Big Mom thanks Jinbei for the gift and for the pongeglyph he had given her the day before, even though she can\u0027t read it. But the Fish Man has an important announcement to make, which Big Mom interrupts because she suspects her loyal sea paladin of wanting to leave his crew.\n\nAt the same time, the team tasked with recovering Sanji continues to sail to Big Mom\u0027s lair. They pass through an area of mixed fruit juices, a sight that captivates all team members except Pedro, who is on guard. Suddenly, a giant watermelon appears on the ocean. Seeing this, Luffy rushes to the bridge and throws his elastic arms out to retrieve the fruit, ignoring Pedro\u0027s warnings that he\u0027s about to catch a Football Fish Fruit. The Straw Hat grabs his booty and takes it back aboard the Sunny. Suddenly, before the horrified eyes of his friends, the strange creature opens its mouth and engulfs Luffy. Everyone thought he was dead, but the Straw Hat had not said his last word. He managed to pulverize his attacker from the inside and did the same with two other fruits, an orange and a peach, which were floating around. Soon, to the delight of Chopper and Carrot, all the members of the expedition were invited to a huge feast where they were able to taste the flesh of these creatures, which were exactly like the fruits that corresponded to them, with the exception of Nami, who had strangely lost her appetite.\n\nAt the same time, on Whole Cake Island, Jinbei had to face Big Mom\u0027s reproachful gaze. She suddenly stands up and invites him to follow her. The proud sea warrior submits, and as he makes his way to Big Mom\u0027s castle, watched in panic by the inhabitants of Sweet City, Jinbei recalls his first meeting with Luffy, when the latter came to Impel Down prison to rescue his brother Ace, and the latter\u0027s death during the terrible battle at the top of Marineford. He also remembers the words he spoke to Luffy to help him overcome the grief caused by the loss of his brother, and the help he had given him on the Isle of the Fish-Men by donating some of his blood to save him after his victory over Hody Jones. It was there that he received the Straw Hat\u0027s invitation to join his crew, but Jinbei politely declined, as he still had things to do. Nevertheless, he promised that when he was finally free of these responsibilities, he would join the crew of the Thousand Sunny, and the time had finally come to fulfill this promise...",

Some of Sweet City\u0027s inhabitants are stunned by the carnage, while others mourn the loss of Charlotte Muscat, whose body still lies in the middle of the street. Suddenly, two dark shadows approach and Charlotte Mont d\u0027Or spots them. He orders them to take her brother\u0027s corpse, carried on a stretcher by two guards, back to the castle to try to save him, while a child standing next to him asks if Jinbei, following his announcement to Big Mom, is going to die too. Mont d\u0027Or replies that such a thing could happen if his mother were angered. At the same time, her mother arrives with Jinbei at the foot of her castle.\nAs the valiant Paladin of the Seas approached the entrance to the empress\u0027s residence, he recalled the last discussion he\u0027d had with his men a few hours earlier, when he\u0027d explained that he had every intention of joining the Straw Hat Crew. Jinbei believes that Luffy will be the pirate to rule all the seas, although the consequences of doing so will be devastating. For his part, Aladin, his most loyal lieutenant, is not against the idea of his captain joining Luffy, and Jinbei is astonished that he agrees with him. The other Fish-Men remind him of all Jinbei has done for them, and that he joined Big Mom\u0027s crew only to protect Fish-Men Island. So they accept his decision and support him whatever happens. But this plan is thwarted by Charlotte Praline, Big Mom\u0027s 29th daughter, who tells Aladin, her husband, that no one had dared leave his mother\u0027s crew until now at the risk of losing his own life.\n\nBack to the present: Jinbei, who had told Big Mom of his desire to leave her crew, listens as she gets angry, saying it wouldn\u0027t be fair if she lost such a valuable collaborator as him. She then shows him a roulette wheel with symbols of human body parts drawn on it and coldly asks him what he\u0027s going to lose in exchange for leaving.\n\nMeanwhile, the Thousand Sunny continues to sail through the waters of Big Mom territory, but finds itself trapped in a sea of solidified syrup. The team tasked with rescuing Sanji has defeated some fearsome giant ants that had been attacking them. Now asleep, these creatures are no longer a threat to them, and it\u0027s at this point that Carrot reveals to Luffy that Pedro had once been a pirate and had once traveled with Pekoms. Pedro doesn\u0027t deny his past, but explains to his new ally that his true intention was to explore the New World with Pekoms to deliver a Road Poneglyph to Duke Nekomamushi, and that the World Government had unjustly considered him a pirate and put a price on his head. However, Pedro was surprised when his leaders showed Luffy and his friends the ancient relic hidden beneath the Whale Tree. It\u0027s a privilege granted only to the Kozuki Clan and, 26 years ago, to Gol D. Roger\u0027s crew. Roger to reach his final destination, Raftel, where he became King of the Pirates. After this confession, Pedro proposes his plan: to divide their group in two. One would rescue Sanji, while the other would steal the Road Poneglyph. Suddenly, the giant ants awaken and attack Luffy and his friends. Luffy and his friends defeat every last one of them. After this misadventure, navigation continues and the Sunny finally arrives in sight of Whole Cake Island.

        "description": "On Whole Cake Island, Nami, Carrot and Chopper continue to chase Sanji, who keeps running away from them. Suddenly, they stop after spotting a half-buried giant in front of them. He tells them he\u0027s here because he likes being in this state and adds that he loves apple juice. Nami finds him strange and tells her companions to flee, but a swordsman rabbit dressed in a cape and hat, a subordinate of Big Mom, tries to kill the young sailor, but Carrot, who was behind her, pushes her aside to dodge the attack.\nAfter this incident, the rabbit disappeared as mysteriously as it had appeared, and the three pirates don\u0027t understand what\u0027s going on. They soon arrive in a strange part of the forest. Nami suddenly notices that her Log Pose and the pendulums hanging from the tree trunks are completely out of kilter. Suddenly, the living trees begin to move their trunks and sing a song about a game of death.\n\nCompletely overwhelmed by events, Nami, Carrot and Chopper try to make their way back to the coast to escape the rabbit that has been chasing them. Young Mink manages to slow down their pursuer by electrocuting his mount, but their assailant has not said his last word and attacks them by whirling his spear, which sends him hurtling in their direction.\n\nMeanwhile, behind Big Mom\u0027s immense castle, an impressive multi-ship vessel arrives at Whole Cake Island. This is the Kingdom of Germa, the world\u0027s only mobile kingdom. It has been specially brought to Whole Cake for the Tea Party. Sanji is aboard with his younger brother Vinsmoke Yonji. The Straw Hat Crew\u0027s cook asks him to leave, but he refuses. They come to blows and Sanji shows everything he\u0027s got to fight for. At the same time, in the mysterious forest, the rabbit continues his attack, but his spear hits the neck of the half-buried man, who sees the three pirates running towards the coast. Nearby, Luffy continues his duel with his clone, activating the Gear Third to shoot him down. But this attack has no effect on the two fighters, who are of equal strength. Suddenly, Nami, Carrot and Chopper arrive at the scene of the fight and ask Luffy to accompany them to the side. In his haste, the real Chapeau de Paille runs towards the forest while his impostor joins his three friends, who manage to cross the river despite the bridge demolished by the talking crocodile. However, they go round in circles and, instead of finding their way out of the forest, they come face to face with the half-buried man who\u0027s in agony. The rabbit\u0027s spear is still stuck in the back of his neck, causing him immense pain. The giant asks them to help him remove it, but Nami and her friends flee again and cross a huge lollipop field. After crossing the river once more, they come across the half-buried man a second time. Nami then understands what\u0027s going on, glancing at her totally deranged Log Pose. But it\u0027s too late as Luffy pounces on her and reveals his true face. It\u0027s actually Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, the 8th daughter of the Charlotte Family, who reveals that they\u0027ve entered the \u0022Seductive Woods\u0022 and is trying to disfigure Nami and Carrot to make them as hideous as she is...",

        "description": "On Tougato, an impressive multi-ship vessel enters Lake Apricot, a harbor for ships belonging to Big Mom\u0027s crew or his allies, behind his huge castle. This is the Kingdom of Germa, the only mobile kingdom in the world with no land of its own. It is ruled by the Vinsmoke, who had previously conquered all of North Blue. A multitude of Germa soldiers populate its shores, training for fierce battles. Sanji observes these battles from a window of the castle. His sister, Vinsmoke Reiju, is sitting in the room, calling out to him. Sanji curtly reminds her that he cut his ties with the Vinsmoke family long ago. Reiju reminds him, however, that royal blood runs in his veins and that he has maids at his disposal as well as soldiers ready to sacrifice themselves for him. But Sanji stubbornly refuses to marry Charlotte Pudding. Suddenly, their discussion is interrupted by the arrival of his father, who enters Sanji\u0027s apartments and calls him \u0022Fiston\u0022. The latter replies that if he has a father, it can\u0027t be him. Jajji retorts that if a man speaks to another man clearly, it\u0027s with his fists, and decides to fight him.\nMeanwhile, in the Seductive Woods, the real Luffy has been separated from the group and is running like hell in search of his friends who had left with his clone. But the forest flora he comes across informs him that he can never leave these woods. The trees and flowers decide to attack the Straw Hat by surprise. At the same time, in the Kingdom of Germa, the soldiers are alarmed: Sanji and his father Jajji are about to duel to determine the young man\u0027s future. Not far away, Vinsmoke Yonji sits in a workshop of sorts. An assistant, who calls him \u0022Master Yonji\u0022, tries to put his head back on, first with a hammer and then with a hydraulic press.\n\nIn the square in front of Jajji Castle, Reiju watched the fight between Sanji and his father. The latter, armed with a spear, attacked first, but Sanji, who is very quick, managed to parry all his blows, much to the astonishment of the Germa 66 soldiers. Reiju is equally impressed. Sanji then launches a counter-attack, using his legs to strike his father, who doesn\u0027t understand why his own son refuses to marry into Charlotte Linlin\u0027s family. Sanji replies that he no longer belongs to the Vinsmoke family and that he wants to save his friends. He then recalls his childhood. He remembered how he was often bullied by his three other brothers for cooking for the poorest of the poor. One day, his father passed by with Reiju, who mocked Sanji. The latter begged Jajji for help, but Jajji said he wasn\u0027t going to help him, as he was useless to his family and a disgrace to them.\n\nBack in the present, Jajji launched another attack on his son, but Sanji managed to stop it by blocking the tip of the spear with his right leg! Jajji doesn\u0027t understand how his son can master Haki. He then orders one of his soldiers to throw him a sword, which he hands to Sanji. But Sanji refuses to use it, as he is still fighting with his legs, and tells him that his hands are only for cooking. This decision exasperates Jajji, who has even more contempt for his son...",

        "description": "Sanji, hands in his pockets, faces his father outside the castle. Reiju watches them intently, as do hundreds of Germa 66 soldiers who have come to witness the battle. Sanji warns his enemy that he won\u0027t use his hands against him, as his hands are made for cooking and not for fighting. In response, his father retorted that it was dishonorable for a nobleman to cook for ordinary people. The fight is then engaged by Jajji who rises by propelling himself into the air and attacks Sanji from above, who retaliates with a \u0022Collier Shoot\u0022. Alas, that\u0027s not enough, and Jajji follows up with \u0022Electromagnetic Crack\u0022 (an attack in which his kick is electrified) and \u0022Blast\u0022, which sends Sanji tumbling against a wall. On the ground, the unloved son of the Vinsmoke Family recalls his childhood, when his father locked him in a dark place with an iron mask over his face. He thinks back to how Jajji had never given him even one good memory, and this enrages him. Before Sanji could get to his feet, his father attacked again. The Straw Hat Crew cook retaliates, setting his right leg on fire, and attacks his father again, who does the same and performs the technique known as \u0022Wall\u0022. Three Germa soldiers line up in front of Sanji, who tells them to withdraw immediately, when Jajji suddenly pierces the middle man with his spear. Sanji is taken aback by this surreal scene and his foot parries the tip of the spear that had pierced the now dead soldier\u0027s belly. Jajji again pulses an electric discharge into his weapon, propelling Sanji into the air. Seeing this, Reiju smiles and stops observing the scene.\nMeanwhile, in the Seductive Woods, Luffy is still looking for his friends, unaware that trees and other animated creatures are smiling, surrounding him and chanting \u0022Let\u0027s play a deadly game\u0022. They clearly tell Luffy that he\u0027ll never get out of here alive, then attack him with their branches. Luffy resists, then lands a heavy blow on a tree to knock it out. He asks the others to stop blocking his path, but this angers them and they surround him even more. At the same time, in the river leading to Sweet City, a shark-shaped submarine sails discreetly by. It\u0027s the Shark Submerge III, piloted by Brook and Pedro, who realize they\u0027ve arrived in the capital of Whole Cake Island. They leave their submarine in an inconspicuous place and exit the submersible to walk to Big Mom\u0027s castle. In town, they spot a newsagent hawking the latest Totto Land News, the newspaper of the Totland Archipelago. Pedro steps forward and sees a photo of Jinbei on the front page.\n\nNot far away, in the Seductive Woods, Luffy has managed to subdue a few over-stirring forest dwellers, but comes face to face with a buried man he\u0027d come across earlier. The latter is complaining of a violent pain in the back of his neck. Luffy extracts a spear from the back of his head. After helping him, the giant asks him for some apple juice, but Luffy refuses and asks if he has seen his companions. Suddenly, Luffy spots Chopper standing motionless in front of the half-buried man.\n\nAt the same time, on Whole Cake Island, in the castle of the Kingdom of Germa, the defeated Sanji is nursed back to health by his older sister Reiju, who dresses his wounds as Jajji enters the room. Sanji openly insults his father, who explains why he used his last fighting technique to defeat him. All the soldiers of Germa 66 are ready to die for the Vinsmoke family. But Sanji doesn\u0027t understand why his father didn\u0027t use his huge army to conquer North Blue. Jajji tells him that he wants to ally himself militarily with Big Mom, hence the organized wedding, which is in fact a mere formality. He also explains that it was unthinkable for him to marry off one of his sons, except for his missing son who was never considered his own blood, but a failure. This remark boils Sanji\u0027s blood as he broods over his rage and distracts him from Reiju, who takes advantage of the situation to place explosive bracelets around his brother\u0027s wrists. Jajji explains that, to force him into marriage, he has ordered his daughter to put explosive bracelets around his wrists, which he can only release by using a key held by Big Mom. If he tried to remove them by force, they would explode in the same way as the Celestial Dragons\u0027 slave necklaces. He adds that he was right to put them on him, because Jajji understood that Sanji\u0027s hands were his most precious possession.\n\nAt the same time, in the Seductive Woods, Luffy sees Chopper turn around and run like an animal. The Straw Hat tried to catch up, but saw a second Chopper running in the opposite direction. As if he wasn\u0027t confused enough, behind a tree he catches a glimpse of Nami, then Carrot, then Sanji and finally Charlotte Pudding, hiding behind trunks and switching places. The trees tell each other that the best strategy is to lead him astray, the better to imprison him. Back at the Germa castle, from the top of the ramparts overlooking the inner courtyard, Sanji unwillingly observes the training of his father\u0027s soldiers. Looking at his wrists, he is suddenly reminded of the episode when, as a child, Zeff had nursed his hands back to health, telling him never to fight with them. He looks again at his handcuffs and lets out a violent curse...",

        "description": "In Sweet City, the townspeople discuss Jinbei, who had asked Big Mom to withdraw from his crew and then backed out for fear of losing one of its members. Some say they no longer have any respect for the Fishman, calling him a coward even though he had managed to cure their mistress of her illness. Pedro, meanwhile, learns who Jinbei is and asks Brook if he knows him too. The living skeleton replies affirmatively, recalling the episode when Luffy had asked Jinbei to join the Straw Hat Crew. Suddenly, Pedro hides under a store window and asks Brook to come discreetly. The two pirates peer through the window and see Charlotte Pudding, who is asked by Baron Tamago to choose a wedding dress. Several women ask her to try on dresses, and for her part, Pedro says she couldn\u0027t part with her guards. Brook wonders who Luffy had seen on the southwest coast of Whole Cake Island, and Pedro speculates that he must have mistaken him for someone else. Brook notes that he has seen Tamago on Big Mom\u0027s boat before, and Pedro says he knows him. The man in question is challenged by guards outside the store who inform him that the Straw Hats have broken into the archipelago, and four of them have been spotted in the Seductive Woods and would soon be captured. They add, however, that Brook and Pedro are still missing. The fact that they\u0027ve been spotted for a long time panics the latter, who try to keep a low profile.\nNot far away, on the northeast coast of Whole Cake Island, Pekoms finds himself cornered against the sea by the crew of the Firetank, led by Capone Bege. The latter is accompanied by his wife Charlotte Chiffon, the 22nd daughter of the Charlotte Family, and their son, young Capone Pez, whom he tries to calm as best he can. Big Mom\u0027s confidant tells Pekoms that he\u0027s going to die soon. He asks him for his last wish, pointing his pistol at his victim while Petz begins to cry again. Pekoms then screams at him that underestimating Big Mom will lead to his downfall. Bege doesn\u0027t get the message, however, and fires point-blank at his former teammate. The Mink lion falls into the shark-infested sea, where the scent of blood draws them in.\n\nAt the same time, in the Seductive Woods, Luffy is still chasing what he thinks are his companions, even though they don\u0027t speak and move like animals. Pudding even imitates an animal sound, which greatly disconcerts Luffy. Nevertheless, the young pirate manages to grab Sanji and tie him up, but he still doesn\u0027t speak and struggles, making monkey noises. Suddenly, a second Sanji arrives and stands in front of Luffy, scratching his nose.\n\nMeanwhile, at Ch\u00e2teau Tougato, in the Queen\u0027s chamber, Big Mom has granted audience to Caesar Clown. She tells him she\u0027s invested a lot of money to help him with his research, and the scientist nervously approves. She explains with some joviality that her dream is for all the races of the world to be united into a single family, and for that family to share lunch with her. So she orders him to develop a drug that will turn this family into giants. Caesar believes this is impossible, and that it would take him a long time to design such a serum since he failed that experiment on Punk Hazard\u0027s children. In reality, Caesar had used Big Mom\u0027s money for his own personal account, buying himself booze and women. He never thought Doflamingo would ever get beaten up, and that upsets him deeply. Big Mom asks him why he\u0027s pulling such a face and Caesar tearfully explains that his research had failed because Luffy and Trafalgar Law destroyed his laboratory. Big Mom tells him, much to his surprise, that she had built a laboratory on Tougato almost identical to the one on Punk Hazard, thanks to her son Charlotte Perospero, who had built it out of candy. However, the Empress gave him just two weeks to develop the Gigantification drug, failing which he would be killed in Charlotte Perospero by turning him into a candy. The latter, possessor of Pero Pero no Mi, a Demon Fruit capable of transforming everything into confectionery, shows Caesar that he has his heart and compresses it in front of him for fun. Caesar then remembers that he had asked Sanji to give him back his heart, but he had thrown it at Vito, and his heart is now in Perospero\u0027s hands! Elsewhere, in the \u0022Seductive Woods\u0022, night has fallen and an exhausted Luffy has managed to catch a fake Sanji and a fake Charlotte Pudding while talking to the buried giant. Nearby are copies of the Straw Hat\u0027s friends, who can\u0027t help gesticulating and multiplying at breakneck speed...",

She, Carrot and Chopper had been attacked by Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, a horrible witch posing as Luffy. She had caught the young sailor in order to disfigure her. But Nami didn\u0027t give in and used her new climatic staff, which Usopp had made for her, to strike her assailant. The latter counter-attacked and Carrot took over, trying to punch Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, but the opposite happened. Carrot was thrown backwards by her own punch! They had discovered, to their horror, that their opponent was a mirror-woman who had eaten Mira Mira no Mi. This strange Demon Fruit enabled its user to create mirrors with his hands. These mirrors could be used to return attacks with the enemy\u0027s reflection. They could also lock the enemy in and prevent him from getting out. This was the sad experience Carrot underwent when he tried to attack Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e once again. The half-buried man witnessed the whole scene, but his situation prevented him from acting.\n\nThe infamous Br\u00fbl\u00e9e then revealed that Big Mom was aware of the Straw Hats\u0027 presence on her territory and had ordered her subordinates to prevent them from finding Sanji. It was for this reason that Luffy and his friends had been dragged into this strange forest where trees and flowers were able to speak and move. Br\u00fbl\u00e9e ordered them to capture Nami, but Chopper thwarted her plan by taking the form of Monster Point so that his friend could escape, promising to bring back reinforcements. Stalked by terrifying nightmare trees and flowers, Nami managed to track down the real Luffy, who mistook her for a double and tied her up by mistake.\n\nAfter this account, Nami turned to the half-buried man and suspected him of being one of Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e\u0027s accomplices, since he hadn\u0027t moved a finger to stop her. At the same time, in Big Mom\u0027s castle, she asked her subjects for news of the intruders who had dared to enter her kingdom. They replied that they were currently in the Seductive Woods being tortured by Br\u00fbl\u00e9e and the Homies who populate the forest. The Empress is thrilled by this announcement, until she receives a visit from her son Charlotte Cracker, who has been summoned by his mother. She orders him to personally take care of Luffy and the other Straw Hats, so that they don\u0027t leave the Seductive Woods alive. Her son gladly accepts her proposal.\n\nIn the Temptress Forest, Nami continues to question the half-buried man, suspecting him of being one of Br\u00fbl\u00e9e\u0027s accomplices after noticing that he hadn\u0027t been attacked. He convinces them otherwise and reveals that each inhabitant of the Totto Land Archipelago must pay a tax by giving the equivalent of one month of their soul, or one year of life every six years, in exchange for the protection and security that Big Mom can offer them. The latter, thanks to her power, scatters all these collected souls throughout her territory via the incarnations made from Linlin\u0027s soul, so that they settle in inanimate beings as well as in animals that immediately become humanized, as was the case with the talking crocodile and the rabbit that attacked the pirates. As for the doubles of Luffy\u0027s friends who are always swarming around, this is quite simply the work of Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e.\n\nThis latest revelation arouses the curiosity of Luffy and Nami, who want to know who they\u0027re dealing with. The half-buried man is tormented by the Straw Hat as a strange individual approaches them, upsetting all the flora in the process. Pressed by Luffy and Nami, the Half-Buried Man confesses and reveals that he is one of the countless husbands of Charlotte Linlin, aka Big Mom. This news terrifies the two pirates as Cracker, Big Mom\u0027s tenth son, approaches, determined to kill them...",

        "description": "As Charlotte Cracker advances towards Luffy and Nami, he frightens the Homies in his path with his immense size. Unaware of the danger threatening them, the two pirates are stunned after hearing the half-buried man\u0027s revelation. But, piqued by curiosity, the Straw Hat wanted to know more about him, and the man confessed to them that he was one of the countless husbands of Charlotte Linlin, aka Big Mom, but had been abandoned by all after giving birth to her two daughters. While he was chatting with the two pirates, a mysterious individual appeared and pulled him from the ground by the hair. It was Charlotte Cracker, Big Mom\u0027s tenth son. The unfortunate man begs for his release so that he can see his daughters, Chiffon and Laura, one last time. At the mention of this last name, Nami suddenly freezes.\nWhile Charlotte Cracker brutalizes Pound, Nami learns from the latter that he is the father of Laura and a certain Chiffon: Laura is therefore Big Mom\u0027s daughter, and the Life Card she gave her during her stopover in Thriller Bark belongs to her mother. Suddenly, Randolph appears from the sky and attacks Luffy and Nami with his crane. He is brutally stopped by Cracker, who takes advantage of the situation to make the Homies faint with his mysterious power, strangely resembling the Haki of Kings, which has the effect of withering the Homies with fear. He then berates Randolph, who surprisingly apologizes as he speaks, as does his crane.\n\nCracker explains that he was sent here as backup by his mother in case Br\u00fbl\u00e9e failed in her mission to trap Luffy and his band of pirates. Big Mom\u0027s daughter then appears and answers vanity over Roi Baum, a giant tree that is the master of the forest. Cracker reminds Br\u00fbl\u00e9e that tomorrow, at noon, all members of the Vinsmoke Family will gather at Whole Cake Castle to forge lasting ties with the family and take advantage of Germa 66\u0027s fabulous technology. But, to spite her brother, she shows him that she has managed to capture Chopper and Carrot with her power after turning her friends\u0027 clones into animals. Suddenly, Br\u00fbl\u00e9e drops her mirror, which shatters on the ground. Luffy rushes to catch the pieces, but Chopper reassures him that he and Carrot are fine, but trapped in another dimension. Cracker, for his part, prepares to kill Pound because he can\u0027t hold his tongue and Big Mom wouldn\u0027t mind seeing him disappear. After all, she\u0027d abandoned him long ago and he\u0027d been her husband just because she married strangers of a different race. Pound begs him not to do it, as he still wants to see his two daughters again before he dies to congratulate them. But Cracker doesn\u0027t listen to him and is ready to deliver the coup de grace by twirling his sword above him. However, Luffy prevents Cracker from swinging the sword at Pound and uses his Haki to free him. Free at last, Pound crawls back to Nami, while the Straw Hat engages in an epic battle with the Sweet Commander.\n\nMeanwhile, Nami flees with Pound, both pursued by the Homies, when Nami pulls out the Life Card given to her by Laura. Strangely enough, their pursuers sense her and suddenly stop chasing them, even the mighty King Baum, much to the dismay of Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, who doesn\u0027t understand what\u0027s going on. But Nami knows what really happened: the piece of paper in her hand is impregnated with the soul of Big Mom, Laura\u0027s own mother...",

        "description": "Night has fallen on the Seductive Woods just as Charlotte Cracker and Luffy are about to clash. The forest dwellers flee at the imminence of battle, but are automatically petrified by the mysterious force of the Sweet Commander. The Straw Hat is ready to attack first and activates Gear Second. Fighting like the devil, he notices that his sword-wielding opponent has the ability to multiply his arms, an advantage that greatly distracts Luffy. The latter, in fact, has great difficulty countering his attacks, even when using his Haki.\nFor her part, Nami notices that the Life Card given to her by Laura is soaked entirely in Charlotte Linlin\u0027s soul. This has the effect of protecting her from the Homies, who can no longer approach her. The young sailor is intrigued by this phenomenon, but is surprised by the unexpected arrival of Luffy, who has been temporarily defeated by Cracker. He advances towards the pirates. At the mere sight of him, Pound is paralyzed with fear. Nami suffers the same fright when she notices the incredible ability of Big Mom\u0027s 10th son. With his advantage, Cracker demonstrates his incredible gift by multiplying his arms and legs before their very eyes.\n\nAlthough his opponent is tough, Luffy has not lost his courage. He activates Gear Second once more and returns to the charge. He uses every fighting technique he knows to bring down his enemy, but nothing helps: Cracker remains unshaken. Faced with this carnage, Nami begs Luffy to stop fighting, reminding him that their main mission was simply to recover Sanji and get out of there as quickly as possible. But the Straw Hat is stubborn and decides to fight Cracker at full strength. For his part, Cracker laughs at his young adversary and takes advantage of the moment to present him with his sword, christened Bretzel, which is a unique weapon in the world. Nami takes fright and asks her captain to flee. But Luffy insists on staying and attacks Cracker with the \u0022Gear Third\u0022. However, his enemy turns out to be a seasoned warrior who manages to parry all the Straw Hat\u0027s attacks. The latter even finds himself in a bad position after realizing that his blows were ineffective against Cracker. Cracker inflicts the \u0022Pretzel Roll\u0022 attack, in which his sword is induced with Haki, sending Luffy waltzing into the middle of the forest and plunging Nami and Pound into despair.\n\nSuddenly, they hear the shrill cackle of Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, who had been observing the scene perched on King Baum. She congratulates her brother on his fight, but he hasn\u0027t finished with the Straw Hat and runs towards her to finish him off. Nami tries to catch up, but is stopped by one of King Baum\u0027s roots. The young sailor looks up and sees Br\u00fbl\u00e9e on one of the branches of this gigantic tree, ready to fight Nami. Noticing that her young adversary was afraid of her, Br\u00fbl\u00e9e revealed that captains Eustass Kid, Scratchmen Apoo, Urouge and Capone Bege, belonging to the same generation of pirates as Luffy, had managed to set foot on Big Mom\u0027s lands but, apart from Capone Bege who quickly became one of her most loyal subordinates, they had been manu militari rejected from Charlotte Linlin\u0027s territories. Only one of these pirates did not meet this fate. He was Urouge, the mad monk, who had defeated one of Big Mom\u0027s four commanders before being annihilated by Cracker in a Homeric battle.\n\nAfter this revelation, Brul\u00e9e tried to catch Nami by pulling her into her \u0022mirror world\u0022 using her powers. But she is prevented from doing so by Pound, who punches her in the face with all his might. Irritated by this betrayal, Br\u00fbl\u00e9e tried to kill her attacker, but was immediately electrocuted by Nami, who had used her Thunder Bolt Tempo. The Homies were paralyzed with fear at the sight of this prodigy. Nami thanked Pound for helping her, even though this gesture would compromise her existence on Tougato Island. The giant reassured her that he was going to be killed anyway, then asked Nami if she was indeed Laura\u0027s friend. The young woman replies that she is, bringing out the Carte de Vie, which once again terrorizes all the inhabitants of the forest. Nami then realized that Laura was indeed Big Mom\u0027s daughter. Knowing this, the navigator was going to take advantage of the Carte de Vie, which had the ability to frighten the trees of the forest.\n\nMeanwhile, Charlotte Cracker took off running towards Luffy, sweeping everything in her path. He finally gets close enough to the Straw Hat to kill him, but the latter resists. He gets up and uses his powers once again to shoot the Sweet Commander. But the Sweet Commander returns with a vengeance. Luffy isn\u0027t one to give up, however, and as he battles his adversary, he yells at him to go and see Sanji anyway...",

        "description": "In the Kingdom of Germa, Sanji mopes while thinking of his friends. He is disturbed in his solitude by his sister Reiju, who informs him that their brothers, Ichiji and Niji, will arrive the next day. This news is neither hot nor cold for the Straw Hat crew\u0027s cook, who continues to ignore his sister. He suddenly thinks back to what his brothers had done to him when he was young, while Reiju warns Sanji that the following day will be a very important one for the Vinsmoke Family, as it will be the first time in 13 years that the whole family will be reunited. In addition, an important event will take place at Big Mom\u0027s castle, where the ceremony between Charlotte Pudding and Sanji will be finalized. Before leaving him, Reiju advises his little brother to go to bed, as he has a very long day ahead of him tomorrow. He says nothing, but his gaze is suddenly drawn to a moth that lands softly on his finger before resuming its flight when Sanji glances at the explosive bracelets still clasping his wrists. He couldn\u0027t remove them and knew he was now at the mercy of his family.\nMeanwhile, in the Temptress Forest, Luffy is having a hard time beating Charlotte Cracker. The latter turns out to be a seasoned warrior who manages to parry all the Straw Hat\u0027s attacks. Cracker uses his swords to send him hurtling through the forest, destroying everything in his path. Luffy finishes his run by crashing into the wall of a cookie house fitted with a paddle wheel. Half-unconscious, he failed to notice that Cracker was approaching him to finish the job. The Homies, terrified, flee at the sight of him. But one of them pulls himself together, reminding them of the mission entrusted to them by Big Mom herself: to prevent anyone from leaving the Temptress Forest. The Homies gather again as Luffy rises to his feet, ready to do battle with Cracker. Once again, the Straw Hat launches an attack and valiantly confronts his enemy. But the young pirate once again struggles to bring him down, as he\u0027s never seen Weapon\u0027s Haki as tough as this. His Haki-induced attacks are not enough to bring down his opponent. The latter continues to advance towards the cookie house, where he inflicts a stinging beating on his opponent. Cracker takes advantage of this moment to try and dissuade Luffy from recovering Sanji, as in his opinion there was no point. Indeed, since Sanji is a nobleman, he will certainly refuse to go with him if he saves him and will tell him to leave, as the mere sight of him would make him sick. This insult infuriates Luffy. The Straw Hat activates the Gear Fourth and attacks his opponent using the \u0022Kong Gun\u0022, momentarily neutralizing Cracker before the astonished eyes of the Homies.\n\nAt the same time, in the streets of Sweet City, Pedro and Brook come within sight of Big Mom\u0027s heavily guarded castle. They come up with the idea of hiding inside one of Cracker\u0027s cookie soldiers and wait for him to finish his patrol before returning to the Whole Cake Ch\u00e2teau. Meanwhile, Chopper and Carrot, their feet chained to ball and chain, are trapped in Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e\u0027s \u0022Mirror World\u0022. The little reindeer discovers mirrors all around them. He decides to take a look.\n\nNot far away, Nami takes advantage of the Life Card given to her by Charlotte Laura, which keeps all the inhabitants of the Temptress Forest at bay. She decides to use it to turn the Homies against the Charlotte Family and use them as her servants to support Luffy in his fight against Cracker. King Baum initially refuses this arrangement, but then changes his mind when he sees Charlotte Linlin\u0027s Life Card glittering before his astonished eyes.\n\nIn another corner of the forest, the battle between Luffy and Cracker continued. Indeed, Big Mom\u0027s 10th son had not said his last word. He rises to his feet and attacks Luffy again with a \u0022Pretzel Roll\u0022, but the Straw Hat uses the full power of his Gear Fourth to destroy his opponent\u0027s cookie armor, who, deprived of this protection, reveals his true appearance: a beardless, purple-haired, shirtless man with fine eyes and a disturbing smile. Cracker reveals that he has eaten Bisu Bisu no Mi, which enables him to create giant animated cookie soldiers indefinitely and manipulate them at will. Faced with this new peril, Luffy has no choice but to continue the duel if he still wants to see Sanji again...",

Big Mom\u0027s son gathers several of his biscuit-men to attack the Straw Hat, who dodges his blows and then tries to retaliate with Gear Fourth techniques, but Cracker protects himself several times behind his biscuit-men. After Luffy has destroyed them all, the Sweet Commander draws his sword, which comes into contact with Luffy\u0027s Haki-covered fist. He manages to fend it off with a sword blow to the stomach, then recreates cookies to discourage it by clapping his hands. Around the two combatants, the living plants are intimidated by the fight and notice that Nami has taken up residence in King Baum\u0027s mouth. The young sailor reminds them that she controls them thanks to Laura\u0027s Life Card. She orders them to attack Cracker, but the Homies explain that they fear him. Despite Pound\u0027s refusal, who treats her harshly, Nami then asks them who they are more intimidated by: Big Mom or Cracker. Meanwhile, Chopper and Carrot notice in Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e\u0027s Mirror World that there are several mirrors leading to different parts of Totland. Chopper devises a plan and asks Carrot to call him big brother. She calls him Choniki, a contraction of Chopper and big brother. The Straw Hat Crew\u0027s doctor, initially embarrassed by this nickname, thinks they could use Br\u00fbl\u00e9e\u0027s power to their advantage and quickly find Sanji through these mirrors.\nAt the same time in Sweet City, night has fallen and a guard made of cookies is on patrol. Brook takes the opportunity to slice through his back without the guard noticing, then hides inside his body with Pedro. The two pirates hide under the guard\u0027s cape and wait for him to finish his patrol before returning to Whole Cake Ch\u00e2teau.\n\nA little later, the sun rises and the duel between Cracker and Luffy continues. The Sweet Commander summons an army of Cracker men, and Luffy manages to break them with the \u0022King Kong Gun: Organ\u0022 technique, tripling the number of his arms before the astonished eyes of his opponent. While the Straw Hat destroys the biscuit-men one by one, Cracker takes advantage of the moment to attack Luffy with his sword, but the latter easily dodges.\n\nNot far away, in Big Mom\u0027s castle, many Homies dance and sing around her while Napoleon, his bicorne talking, informs her that she will soon receive the Vinsmoke and that the wedding cake will be ready for tomorrow. Big Mom then asks her bicorn if the intruders have any chance of escaping from the Forest of Temptation, which he promptly refutes. Big Mom also learns from Napoleon that the rest of the Vinsmoke Family has just arrived at Whole Cake Island, while in the Kingdom of Germa, Germa 66 celebrates the victorious return of Vinsmoke Ichiji and Vinsmoke Niji, the eldest sons of Vinsmoke Jajji, who are acclaimed by their subjects. For his part, Sanji mopes and trembles as he watches the return of his elder brothers from the castle balcony. After this triumphant welcome, Ichiji and Niji appear before their father, who congratulates them on their victory on Brock Colie Island. It\u0027s at this point that Vinsmoke Reiju sends for Sanji, who is humiliated by Niji when he mocks him for his handcuffs. Sanji pushes him away violently, which irritates his brother. After this incident, the entire Vinsmoke Family is finally reunited for breakfast in their floating castle. Jajji then debriefs his sons on their intervention on Brock Colie Island. He explains that the island\u0027s army called on them because it had run out of weapons, the weapons that Doflamingo had been supplying them with. He points out that Germa 66 is a member nation of the World Government and Vinsmoke Yonji reminds him that the Reverie will soon take place. Jajji replies that after the power they will soon gain, the World Government will surely take away their right to participate in the Reverie. Niji then addresses Sanji, telling him that his absence has preoccupied them after teasing him about running away as a child and then wondering where and how his death would be most amusing. At this question, Yonji bursts out laughing and Sanji orders Niji to finish what\u0027s on his plate, but Niji refuses, claiming he\u0027d already eaten before coming. Sanji is disgusted by this response, criticizes his brother for having no idea of the importance of food and ends up insulting him by calling him a stupid prince. Niji, exasperated, calls the head cook, Cosette, complaining that her bad cooking has ruined Sanji\u0027s good mood. Calmly, he throws the dish in her face, but the plate is intercepted by Sanji and the contents fall to the floor. Sanji, distressed by such behavior, reprimands his older brother for wanting to disfigure a woman\u0027s face...",

        "description": "In the Temptress Forest, Luffy continues his fight against Charlotte Cracker\u0027s cookie men, but the battle is unequal. No sooner has the Straw Hat finished destroying soldiers than his opponent rushes to make new ones with his power. Seeing that the only solution is to defeat Cracker, Luffy uses the full force of his Gear Fourth to bring him down. But Big Mom\u0027s 10th son immediately creates dozens of cookie soldiers to tire out his attacker. The latter stopped his attack for lack of time and decided to use another method. He launched himself into the air, pumping his right fist to the max before rocketing towards his opponent. The latter erects rows of biscuit-men to weaken the Straw Hat\u0027s attack, but the latter uses a Gomu Gomu no King Kong Gun that pulverizes all Cracker\u0027s creations in an instant! But just as he\u0027s about to strike, the Gear Fourth\u0027s effects wear off and Luffy is brutally pushed backwards before the astonished eyes of his opponent. The Straw Hat ends up in the middle of the forest. He tries in vain to get up, but his strength fails him. He has to face the facts: Luffy needs ten minutes to reactivate the Gear Fourth and must hide to gain time.\nMeanwhile, at Germa Castle, Jajji witnesses Niji and Sanji arguing. The latter is outraged that his brother should hold Cosette, the head cook, in such contempt. Before the incredulous eyes of his family, Sanji picks up the aligot, a mixture of cheese and potatoes, which has spilled onto the floor, and begins to eat it after giving details of the dish and its nutritional importance. Cosette tries to stop him, but to no avail, while Niji looks disgusted. Excited by this behavior, Niji rushes at Sanji to hit him, but is prevented by his father, who reminds him that his younger brother\u0027s wedding will soon be taking place. However, the power of Niji\u0027s attack knocks Cosette over, and she falls half-fainting. Sanji offers her his hand to lift her up. Sanji\u0027s attitude revolts Niji, who finds it scandalous for the Vinsmoke family, while Sanji replies that his main dishonor is to belong to that family. With Cosette running off, the tension between the two brothers is ratcheted up a notch. Sanji criticizes the members of his family, regarding the others as less than nothing, while Ichiji has never understood his younger brother\u0027s attitude since they were children. Their father, Jajji, makes the same observation before revealing to Sanji a photo of Zeff, pointing out that it was this man who had put absurd ideas into his son\u0027s head. When Sanji sees the photo, he immediately freezes. Jajji coldly tells his son that he knows his past, and that two years ago he was working on board the restaurant ship Baratie.\n\nJajji now has Sanji at his mercy, and recalls his last conversation with Baron Tamago, who lent him the explosive handcuffs and gave him Zeff\u0027s photo, pointing out that he knew the weak point of both the Straw Hats and Sanji. Jajji then suggests that Sanji comply and accept his marriage to Charlotte Pudding, or he\u0027ll have Zeff\u0027s throat slit. Sanji, who knows that his father was capable of such a thing, suddenly remembers his past and his encounter with Zeff at the Redfoot, who had shown him the ropes by treating him harshly. Sanji also remembers the sinking of his ship and its rescue. He remembers his long stay on a deserted rock with Zeff, who had saved his life, and the days of uninterrupted starvation. It was during this period that Sanji understood the importance of food. It should not be wasted in vain, for it is precious. After this misadventure, Sanji and Zeff opened their restaurant, and when Luffy\u0027s crew arrived, Sanji bade farewell to his benefactor, swearing that until death he would not forget all he had done for him.\n\nBack to the present: Sanji faces his father. Jajji hopes his son\u0027s wedding will go well. In fact, the whole Vinsmoke family has been invited to Big Mom\u0027s castle to have lunch with her and meet Puddding. Resigned, Sanji has no choice but to obey his father. Meanwhile, in the Forest of Temptation, Cracker orders his Cracker Cookie men to find Luffy, who has gone into hiding to recuperate. But he is spotted by Cracker\u0027s army. Without Haki, the Straw Hat is no match for his opponents. Indeed, one of the Cracker-men has found his trail and tries to eliminate him using his sword. At his wits\u0027 end, Luffy dodges his attacks, but he\u0027s still vulnerable...",

        "description": "Luffy has to wait ten minutes if he wants to reactivate the Gear Fourth, and during this time his life is threatened by one of Charlotte Cracker\u0027s cookie men, who had managed to track him down. Straw Hat, exhausted, can no longer escape. His adversary takes advantage of the situation to deliver the coup de gr\u00e2ce by bringing his sword down on him. However, King Baum intervenes, commanded by Nami, and saves Luffy\u0027s life by violently striking the man-biscuit, who flies off into the air. The young pirate is delighted to see his friend again, while the King of the Forest of Temptation curses her for daring to hit one of Cracker\u0027s creatures. King Baum is at Nami\u0027s mercy, however, as the young sailor holds the Life Card given to her by Charlotte Laura, which is imbued with Big Mom\u0027s aura.\nAfter the reunion, Luffy tells Nami that he has to wait ten minutes before he can use his Haki again, and must rest. The young woman understands his situation and orders all the Homies to place Luffy in King Baum\u0027s mouth for safekeeping. Despite the latter\u0027s protest, the Straw Hat is carefully led into King Baum\u0027s mouth to rest and regain enough strength to activate his Gear Fourth a second time. After thanking his friend, Luffy falls asleep, while Nami suddenly spots one of Cracker\u0027s biscuit-men running back in their direction. Nami orders King Baum and the other Homies to flee if they don\u0027t want to be torn to shreds by Cracker\u0027s creature. Cracker hears their cries of distress in the distance and rushes after them, clapping his hands so that his Homies will follow blindly. For her part, Nami orders King Baum to pick up the pace if he doesn\u0027t want to be overtaken by Cracker.\n\nMeanwhile, back in the Mirror World, Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e is still reeling from Nami\u0027s attack and is determined to take her revenge. But first she has to find Chopper and Carrot, who are having a hard time escaping this bizarre place because of the balls attached to their ankles. They look in the mirrors for Sanji. The two friends think they\u0027ve found him, but unfortunately they come across a look-alike who vaguely resembles the cook from the Straw Hat Crew. Despite their best efforts, they were unable to find Sanji. Suddenly, a thud is heard. Intrigued, Chopper and Carrot see Big Mom walking down a corridor through a mirror. This horrifying sight stuns them on the spot. Indeed, the mistress of Whole Cake Island was smiling! After this moment of horror, Chopper and Carrot overhear the conversation of two guards who had crossed Big Mom\u0027s path and learn that Sanji will be invited to a meal in Big Mom\u0027s castle with all the members of the Vinsmoke Family to finalize the union of Sanji and Charlotte Pudding. They also understand that their friend is in Germa 66\u0027s castle, and must do everything in their power to find a mirror giving a view of the castle\u0027s interior.\n\nAt the same time, in the Vinsmoke mansion, Cosette, the head cook, is strolling quietly through the corridors. Stopping at a window, she readjusts her hair and suddenly thinks of Sanji, who had come to her defense. The young woman is troubled and begins to feel for him. But Cosette is surprised by Niji, who is astonished by the young woman\u0027s presence in this part of the castle. One day later, Sanji wanders through the same corridors and discovers Cosette unconscious and with a swollen face. This incident sends Sanji into a frenzy, and he calls for help to save Cosette\u0027s life. His brother Yonji, who blames him for allowing a commoner to have confidence in her, then calls for help. But Sanji wasn\u0027t angry with Yongi, since he knew the name of Cosette\u0027s assailant. It\u0027s Niji! His older brother invites him to follow him to lead him to him. The cook from the Chapeau de Paille crew obeys and follows Yonji, leaving the head cook in the care of the doctor who has rushed to her side. Yonji takes Sanji to a secret room in the castle, where he discovers hundreds of stasis capsules containing soldiers from Germa 66 who all look alike.\n\nNot far away, in the Forest of Temptation, King Baum continues his frantic flight on Nami\u0027s orders, to lose Cracker and his cookie men and give Luffy time to recover. The young sailor orders the Homies to slow down their pursuers\u0027 progress, but they are no match for them. Nami has to do all she can to buy time for Luffy to regain his full vitality. But despite their best efforts, Nami and her companions are quickly overtaken by Charlotte Cracker, whose mere presence petrifies any Homies unfortunate enough to be near him. Big Mom\u0027s 10th son notices that King Baum has joined the ranks of the Straw Hats and chastises him by slicing off the top of his skull with his sword. Then he confronts Nami, announcing that he\u0027s going to kill them all.\n\nAt the same time, in the secret laboratory of Germa 66\u0027s castle, Yonji explains to Sanji that he is facing the soldiers of Germa 66. Sanji notes that they all have the same head, and Yonji replies that men can be made. He reveals that Germa 66 has always been known as \u0022The Kingdom of Science\u0022 and that their father, before he and Sanji were born, was a great scientist who was part of an outlawed foreign group of researchers working for Dr. Vegapunk. To Sanji\u0027s astonishment, Yonji added that Vegapunk and Jajji had achieved a revolutionary feat: they had been able to discover how to create life. After this discovery, the World Government decided that this was too great a power and arrested Vegapunk. The research group was disbanded and Jajji worked on Germa 66. The humans crammed into vats in front of Sanji are in fact clones created by Jajji for use as cannon fodder! They are the ideal soldiers, programmed to wage war and blindly obey their leaders. Assets that made Germa 66 so powerful. Of course, these soldiers are unaware that they are clones. Yonji also points out that their current location could be likened to a soldier\u0027s garage, and that it took five short years to design a twenty-year-old soldier. Yonji continues his explanation, but Sanji interrupts him in disgust. Just then, Ichiji and Niji enter the laboratory. Sanji catches sight of the latter and attacks him to punish him for having beaten Cosette before the astonished eyes of his brothers...",

        "description": "Nami uses her climatic stick and prepares to take on Charlotte Cracker\u0027s terrifying cookie men, while Luffy continues to recuperate, well protected in King Baum\u0027s trunk. Bravely rushing ahead of her foes, the young sailor orders the King of the Temptation Forest to protect her for as long as possible, while she distracts her adversaries to open a breach through which the Homies can escape. She then executes her plan, enabling King Baum and his retinue to flee, taking the still-weak Straw Hat with them. But her tactics don\u0027t work, and Nami soon becomes the target of Cracker\u0027s biscuit-men, who want to kill her with their swords. But the young woman doesn\u0027t give in, moving quickly to avoid their sword blows. For his part, Cracker is impressed by Nami\u0027s zeal and congratulates her. However, Nami remains on her guard and nearly loses her life when Cracker tries to strike her from behind. After missing her, Big Mom\u0027s 10th son asked her why she and her friends were risking their lives to save a member of the Vinsmoke Family. It was beyond him. Nami confirms that he wouldn\u0027t understand Sanji\u0027s importance to her. Sure, he\u0027s a pervert attracted to women, but he\u0027d do anything to save his friends\u0027 lives at the risk of his own. And to thank him for his dedication, his comrades are willing to do anything to rescue him, even if it means risking their lives to face an enemy as dangerous as Big Mom. On the strength of this argument, the battle between Nami and Cracker resumes, but this time Cracker confronts her in person. Unfortunately, Nami is no match for Cracker and soon finds herself in a bad position. Just as Cracker was about to run her through with his sword, the Sweet Commander was heckled by Luffy, who had regained his full strength. The young sailor is relieved to find her friend back on his feet. Luffy tells her that he will now take care of their enemy, while she continues to search for Sanji.\nMeanwhile, in the secret laboratory of the Kingdom of Germa, Sanji avenges Cosette with a violent kick to Niji, who seems surprised by the attack. For his part, Ichiji reminds Sanji that Zeff\u0027s life is in his hands, and if he doesn\u0027t comply, his friend will be killed. But the Straw Hat crew\u0027s cook wants to continue his vendetta, but Niji won\u0027t let him. The latter grabs him by the back of the neck and inflicts the \u0022Henry Needle\u0022 attack: a highly electrically-charged knee strike to the spine that knocks Sanji to the ground. After this beating, Niji and his two other brothers welcome Sanji into the Vinsmoke family, before reminding him who he was in their eyes: a failure!\n\nAt the mention of this word, Sanji recalls that one day their father had gathered them together to announce that their bodies had been physically and intellectually enhanced by genetic manipulation, and that, thanks to this \u0022enhancement\u0022, the whole Vinsmoke siblings were fit to lead Germa 66 to new glories. To showcase these abilities, Jajji pushed his children to train in agility and strength trials, in which Sanji failed miserably compared to his brothers and sister, and this weakness caused his father disappointment. After these tests, the employee in charge of making the assessment announced that, indeed, Ichiji, Niji, Reiju and Yonji had the abilities of an adult at their age, thanks to their genes. However, Sanji has suffered an error in the modification of his genes and has remained a simple human being, which explains the poor results of his tests. In his room, Sanji is cared for by his sister Reiju and discovers that she has heart. But the little girl asks him to keep quiet for fear of being harassed by his brothers. After these misadventures, Sanji prepared food for a little rat who used to visit him when he was alone. But he was surprised by his father, who reprimanded him severely for the sole reason of cooking for someone, reminding him that this was his dead mother\u0027s job. Throwing the poor little rat and the plate his son had just prepared out of the window, he ordered him never to cook again, as it dishonored the honor of the Vinsmoke. Crying, Sanji had to submit, and despite all his efforts, he couldn\u0027t catch up. So his father decided to get rid of him by making his people believe that his youngest son had died in an accident. In truth, Sanji had not died, but had been placed in prison, his face covered by an iron mask so that the guards assigned to watch over him could not know who he was. From the depths of his cell, he wept all the tears of his body, imploring his father to forgive him for being so weak...",

        "description": "It\u0027s been six months since little Sanji was born. His brothers and sister have forgotten his existence and continue their training under the watchful eye of their proud father and the acclaim of all their subjects. Sanji, for his part, is not dead and languishes in his gaol, face masked, thinking he\u0027ll never see the sunlight again. He is, however, visited by a little mouse who brightens up his day a little. A few Germa 66 employees regularly bring him food. At the castle, the kingdom\u0027s cooks wondered who the food was really for, but they had to obey the king\u0027s orders and ask no questions. For his part, Sanji fed his little guest and remembered his father\u0027s harsh remarks about his late mother\u0027s activities. The little boy remembered very well that, before his mother died, precisely when she was ill, he used to visit her regularly to bring her favorite dishes. She was the only person in the whole Kingdom of Germa to appreciate her dishes, and it was thanks to her that Sanji developed a passion for cooking at an early age, asking his jailers to bring him cooking utensils and books. It was while consulting one of these that he discovered the existence of All Blue, a sea of fish from the four seas of the planet.\nAs the days go by, Sanji\u0027s culinary talents finally come to the fore. But one day, Vinsmoke Ichiji notices one of the guards bringing food into the kingdom\u0027s prison and decides to follow him. Shortly afterwards, in possession of the key to Sanji\u0027s cell and in the company of his two other brothers, he pays a courtesy call on his dead brother with the sole aim of beating him up. After this misadventure, Reiju, witnessing his brothers\u0027 relentlessness against Sanji, pays him a visit and takes pity on him. She explains that the genetic modifications they have undergone have deprived them of compassion, but it hasn\u0027t worked on her, and she feels different from them. However, she reminds Sanji that she\u0027s not \u0022on his side\u0022, then informs him that the kingdom has business on East Blue, and is currently crossing Red Line. Thanks to their special ships, the Germa 66 manages to cross the immense mountain without any difficulty. Meanwhile, Sanji continues to perfect his culinary skills, while being harassed all day long by Ichiji, Niji and Yonji, and nursed back to health by Reiju. One day, he tells her of his decision to become a chef, a revelation that upsets his older sister, who doesn\u0027t understand his choices. Yet Sanji was ready to do anything to realize his dream. At the same time, Germa 66 troops attack the Kotzians. Sanji takes advantage of this opportunity to ask Reiju to help him escape from his prison. Reiju accepts and breaks the bars with her bare hands! Having regained his freedom, Sanji follows his sister\u0027s advice and runs to his father\u0027s room to steal the key that will free him from his iron mask. However, he is surprised by Jajji, who is amazed by the fiery temperament of this son who used to shame him. Threatening him with a dagger, Sanji orders his father to let him leave the Kingdom of Germa. His father agreed to let him go, but asked him never to reveal to anyone that he was his father. Jajji doesn\u0027t want to be further shamed by a son he has never loved. After shedding his mask, Sanji runs off in tears as war rages nearby. Outside, Reiju accompanies his brother to a cruise ship that had the misfortune to anchor in the harbor of the island attacked by Germa 66. As the ship had nothing to do with the conflict, it was left unharmed by the belligerents. Reiju, like Sanji, sobbing, orders him to board the ship, telling him that one day he\u0027ll meet people who will treat him as he deserves, and to run without looking back.\n\nBack to the present: Sanji, an adult, is beaten up by his three brothers, who leave him half-dead and with a swollen face...",

Meanwhile, in the \u0022Temptress Forest\u0022, Luffy faces Charlotte Cracker\u0027s cookie men. The Straw Hat orders Nami to flee with the Homies. The young sailor obeys and mischievously shows King Baum the Life Card soaked in Big Mom\u0027s essence, so the tree king agrees to cooperate. For his part, Luffy is racked with hunger, but first he must concentrate on his battle. His adversary, having noticed his weakness, orders one of his warriors to attack Luffy. Luffy manages to dodge his sword strike, while Cracker continues to create more cookie-men with his power. Soon, the Straw Hat finds himself completely surrounded by dozens of cookie warriors, at Cracker\u0027s mercy!\nLuffy\u0027s situation looks desperate. Suddenly, the smell of cookie wafts into his nostrils, and he decides to try the pieces of cookie on the ground, but they\u0027re too hard to eat. Cracker laughed at this and explained to his opponent that the cookies he made were for fighting, not for eating. However, they were cookies all the same, and Nami, who had been watching the fight from afar, came up with an idea to help her friend. Using her climatic stick, the young woman created a rain capable of softening the cookies so that Luffy could destroy them more easily. This ruse worked perfectly and annoyed Cracker, who decided to create new warriors despite the rain that continued to fall. For his part, Luffy was unimpressed by the number of his opponents and began to devour them, encouraged by Nami, who had discovered the weak point of Big Mom\u0027s son\u0027s Fruit du D\u00e9mon: the water made the cookies soft. The more Cracker made new warriors, the faster Luffy gobbled them up, to the amazement of King Baum and the Homies.\n\nFaced with this affront, Charlotte Cracker began creating dozens of new warriors. Nami, witnessing this prodigy, orders Luffy and the Homies to retreat. The Straw Hat obeys, while Cracker orders his cookie soldiers to pursue the fugitives deep into the Temptress Forest. As he runs, Luffy vows to eat all Cracker\u0027s cookie men and save Sanji.\n\nAt the same time, in the Mirror World of Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, Chopper and Carrot are pursued by the mistress of the place, armed with a scythe, and their run is broadcast on all the mirrors of the Totland Archipelago. Not far away, in the Temptress Forest, Luffy launches a counter-attack and soaks Cracker\u0027s biscuit-men with apple juice and melon juice to make them softer and tastier. This ruse annoys Cracker, who sees his entire fine army of warriors decimated under the voracious fangs of the Straw Hat. However, Big Mom\u0027s 10th son has not said his last word and creates dozens of new cookie warriors who surround Luffy. The latter, his belly distended by his incredible feast, sees his adversaries advancing before him. For her part, Nami once again brings down rain with her climate stick to soften Cracker\u0027s creations, then once again encourages Luffy by ordering him to eat as many warriors as his stomach can swallow. The Straw Hat takes his friend at his word, determined to devour all his opponents and bring back Sanji.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Kingdom of Germa, things heat up when Jajji decides to summon his children to the Whole Cake Ch\u00e2teau to meet the Charlotte Family. For her part, Reiju helps her brother conceal his swollen face using a special mask that erases in an instant all the wounds Sanji had received to prevent his fianc\u00e9e from being frightened at the sight of his swollen head. After treating her brother, she asks him where his gallantry comes from. This question surprises Sanji, who flashes back to his Baratie days when Zeff taught him never to hit a woman, a rule Sanji had always followed.\n\nIn the Temptress Forest, Luffy has once again triumphed over Cracker\u0027s cookie men, but his belly is completely full. For his part, his opponent is exhausted and fed up with fighting the Straw Hat, who has a nasty habit of fighting, fleeing, returning and eating. To finish him off, Cracker decides to create a new batch of cookie men, then threatens King Baum, who had dared to defy Big Mom\u0027s authority by helping the Straw Hats. The Tree King tries to defend himself by explaining to Cracker that he and the Homies were being manipulated by Nami, who has one of Big Mom\u0027s Life Cards in her possession. But this excuse doesn\u0027t convince Cracker, who is always ready to punish the inhabitants of the Temptress Forest. Big Mom\u0027s son orders his cookie men to attack Luffy, while Nami brings on the rain for a third time. For his part, the Straw Hat has reached his limit and is no longer able to swallow new cookies. But faced with the threat, he draws on his last reserves and, encouraged by Nami, voraciously devours the cookie warriors under the appalled gazes of the Homies and the ulcerated eyes of Cracker...",

        "description": "In his room, Sanji, in the company of his sister Reiju, is visited by a maid who brings him a clean shirt so that Sanji will be presentable for the commitment ceremony to be held at Whole Cake Ch\u00e2teau. His sister forces him to get dressed, even though he has no desire to go.\nMeanwhile, in the Temptress Forest, Luffy continues to wreak havoc among Charlotte Cracker\u0027s cookie men, who are getting tired of creating too many soldiers, who are immediately devoured by the Straw Hat through Nami. Luffy, his belly distended, has become monstrous and enormous. He confesses to his adversary that he can\u0027t eat anything else, and Cracker takes advantage of the situation to order his cookie warriors to attack Luffy. But this was without counting on Nami, who sends rain down on her opponents to soften them and make them brittle. Luffy, forced by circumstance, continues to devour Cracker\u0027s creatures to his heart\u0027s content, before the stunned eyes of King Baum, who couldn\u0027t believe the appetite of a mere human! But Luffy has reached his limit, much to Cracker\u0027s delight. Cracker swung his sword and stabbed Luffy in the most vulnerable part of his body: his stomach. Nami, from the top of King Baum, yells at her friend to be careful, and the latter uses his haki to cover his right arm before taking a deep breath. As he does so, Luffy activates a new form of Gear Fourth that stuns Cracker. Cracker tries to pierce Luffy\u0027s belly, but is unable to do so. Cracker returns and tries to decapitate Luffy, but the latter won\u0027t allow him the honor.\n\nCracker tries one last attack, gathering all his power, but it has no effect on Luffy. Luffy pulls his opponent towards him, who is literally swallowed by his belly. Risking asphyxiation, Big Mom\u0027s 10th son orders his cookie men to come and save him. As his soldiers reach him, Luffy asks Nami not to get them wet. Intrigued by this wish, the young sailor submits and sees her captain use the \u0022Cannon Ball\u0022 technique, violently exhaling his opponent from his body. Cracker then proceeds to smash all the cookie soldiers in his path. The force of the attack is so strong that it sends Cracker flying across the whole of Tougato Island to Whole Cake Ch\u00e2teau, where he is found by the ministers of Big Mom, Charlotte Mont d\u0027Or, Charlotte Galette and Charlotte Opera, who declare a state of emergency throughout the country, knowing that Luffy was nearby. For his part, the effects of the Gear Fourth wear off and the Chapeau de Paille regains his normal size before the astonished eyes of Nami, who notices that her friend still has his paunch. Luffy explains that he\u0027s eaten enough cookies to last a lifetime, and Gear Four takes up a lot of his energy. Suddenly, Pound emerges from a bush and explains to the pirates that he thought they had lost to Cracker and that he had preferred to flee. But, seeing that this was not the case, Pound warns Nami and Luffy that the defeat of one of Big Mom\u0027s sons would provoke her wrath and explains that the Empress is able to create storms with her powers if surrounded by her subordinates, Zeus and Prometheus.\n\nDespite this threat, Luffy is determined to save Sanji and laments to Nami that they have wasted too much time in the Seductive Woods. He is determined to prevent their friend\u0027s marriage to Charlotte Pudding. For her part, Nami had heard that the ceremony was to be held in a castle. As the Straw Hat was unable to get up from the colossal amount of cookies he had just ingested, Luffy ordered King Baum to take him immediately to Big Mom\u0027s castle. The tree king is forced to accept after Nami shows him Charlotte Laura\u0027s Life Card.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Mirror World, Carrot and Chopper are still being pursued by Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, armed with a large scythe, with the aim of killing them. The two escapees manage to lose her and catch their breath. Suddenly, Carrot sees Sanji through a mirror and tries in vain to call him and Chopper. But their friend is accompanied by his sister Reiju and they learn that they are on their way to Whole Cake Ch\u00e2teau, Big Mom\u0027s home. Chopper and Carrot must pass this information on to Nami and Luffy, but they are surprised by Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, who is delighted to have finally found them.\n\nAt the same time, to the cheers of all the soldiers of Germa 66, Sanji steps forward to take his place in the carriage already containing his father and brothers, which is to take him to Big Mom\u0027s castle. The atmosphere is chilly, and Sanji has to put up with their company after donning a red cape, a symbol of royalty. The convoy slowly leaves the Kingdom of Germa, while Sanji feels a twinge of sadness at the thought of never seeing his old companions again...",

        "title": "A heartbreaking duel - Luffy versus Sanji (Part 1)",
        "description": "While still working as a cook aboard the Baratie, Sanji had given food to the starving Gin. It was on this occasion that he met Luffy who, witnessing his great generosity towards a starving pirate, invited him to join his own crew. Sanji seemed surprised by this request, and didn\u0027t immediately respond. But it was when he saw the Straw Hat fight the fearsome Don Krieg that Sanji changed his mind. With the approval of his mentor, Zeff, Sanji agreed to join the Straw Hat crew and follow Luffy wherever he went. It was the beginning of a solid friendship. Sanji remembered this episode from his past as he walked with the rest of his family towards Big Mom\u0027s castle.\nAt the same time, Nami and Luffy, transported by King Baum, emerged from the Forest of Temptation to rescue Sanji. The young sailor, who had a piece of mirror in her possession, receives a message from Chopper. The little reindeer informs her that he and Carrot are in big trouble, being chased by Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e all over the Mirror World. Nami tries to find out what\u0027s going on, but the connection is suddenly severed. As for Chopper and Carrot, their situation is becoming increasingly worrying. Using her power, Br\u00fbl\u00e9e pulls the talking crocodile, Randolph and his faithful mount out of their world to help her catch the two fugitives. Chopper, far from being afraid of the fate that awaited him, explains to Carrot that he may have found a way to save Sanji.\n\nOn her way to Whole Cake Ch\u00e2teau with Luffy, Nami had not forgotten the horrible arrangement Big Mom had made when she decided to make Sanji her son-in-law. She had entrusted this dirty deed to Capone Bege, who had kidnapped her friend and handed him over to the Empress. She also remembered that Sanji had told her not to worry about him, and that he\u0027d be okay no matter what. However, it was time to fight Big Mom\u0027s men, and Nami recalls the fierce battle between Luffy and Charlotte Cracker, who had underestimated her opponent, and her friend\u0027s victory over Big Mom\u0027s 10th son, who was soundly beaten by the prodigious power of the Straw Hat. The latter, as if by magic, had regained his usual silhouette, much to Nami\u0027s amazement. For his part, King Baum informed his \u0022passengers\u0022 that they would soon be in sight of the castle. Instead, they spotted a curious, heavily-armed convoy on its way to Big Mom\u0027s mansion. It\u0027s the Germa 66 escort protecting the Vinsmoke Family. Hearing the name, Luffy jolts awake and realizes he\u0027s finally found Sanji. Without warning, he jumps from the top of King Baum and abandons Nami to join the Vinsmoke carriage. Nami tries to dissuade him, but to no avail. Already, Luffy has reached the convoy and cheerfully calls out to Sanji, who doesn\u0027t seem to be listening to him, nor to the rest of his family, who were nonetheless surprised by the Straw Hat\u0027s impromptu arrival. But the joy of the reunion disappears completely when Sanji brutally ejects Luffy from the royal carriage with a violent kick before Nami\u0027s horrified eyes. In response, Sanji informs his former companions that he has decided to accept his royal status by calling himself Vinsmoke Sanji from now on, and insults his former companions by calling them dirty pirates. Luffy doesn\u0027t understand his friend\u0027s attitude and is ready to come to blows with him to get him back. For his part, Sanji is determined to show him what he\u0027s made of.\n\nAs Sanji prepares to fight Luffy, he recalls his painful past when his father imprisoned him, forcing him to wear an infamous iron mask that concealed his face. Sanji also remembered his heart-rending pleas to be released from that place, as well as his father\u0027s derogatory remarks about his son cooking for others. Nor had he forgotten the constant beatings he received from his brothers, or the discovery, deep in his dungeon, of All Blue, which made him dream. But there was only one person who stood by him. That person was his elder sister Reiju, who took pity on Sanji and nursed the wounds inflicted on him by his three brothers. It was to her that Sanji confessed his desire to become a cook, even if it went against the principles of the Vinsmoke family. But his mind was made up. Sanji wanted to leave his family to realize his dream, and Reiju decided to help him. She got him into their father\u0027s room to steal the key that opens the lock on his mask. But Sanji was discovered by Vinsmoke Jajji, who was astounded by the aplomb of the son he had despised, and agreed to let him go on one condition: never to tell anyone he was his father. He did this so as not to bring shame on his family. Reiju, who witnessed this scene, ordered his brother to board the first ship to leave if he really wanted to leave his family and realize his dream of one day reaching All Blue.\n\nSanji was discovered on board the Hobbit by two cooks. On seeing them, the young boy begged them to keep him and do whatever they would give him, while making it clear that he wanted to become a cook. He begged so hard that the two men accepted his presence. Sanji kept this moment engraved in his memory, as well as his first meeting with Luffy aboard the Baratie, where he tried to make him discover the beauties of All Blue, even though the young pirate had never known of the existence of this miraculous sea. In the past, Sanji had already praised this sea when he was aboard the Hobbit. As a simple kitchen clerk, he used to make his fellow cooks dream about the magic of All Blue, where you could find every fish you could imagine. But during a storm, the Hobbit\u0027s crew came face to face with Zeff\u0027s fearsome Redfoot pirates aboard the Cooking George. The latter finds Sanji, whom he mistreats harshly until he hears the words \u0022All Blue\u0022 from the kid\u0027s mouth. However, a giant wave capsizes both ships and Sanji is thrown violently into the water. Zeff rushes to Sanji\u0027s aid, but in his panic, his right leg gets caught in debris. The pirate is forced to cut it off if he is to save Sanji from drowning. He succeeds, and the two of them land on a small island after discovering that they were the only two survivors of the shipwreck. Zeff tells Sanji not to worry about him and leaves him a small bag of food, which he must ration until help comes to save them. For days, Sanji scanned the horizon in the hope of finding a sail, but his food supplies dwindled day by day until he had nothing left. He went to see Zeff, who hadn\u0027t touched his food all that time. Desperate for food, Sanji grabbed a knife and discovered, to his horror, that instead of food he had a fabulous treasure. The young boy couldn\u0027t understand what had happened to him and was horrified to discover that Zeff had only one leg left! The pirate explained that he had saved him because he shared the same dream: All Blue. Shortly after their rescue, Sanji and Zeff opened their restaurant, which they named Le Baratie. It was in this restaurant that Sanji honed his culinary skills, despite Zeff\u0027s ruthlessness in not tolerating any slackening in his work, and his insistence that women should always be respected...",

        "title": "A heartbreaking duel - Luffy versus Sanji (Part 2)",
        "description": "Sanji is still immersed in his memories and recalls his violent altercation with his father Jajji. Their duel was short-lived, as the leader of Germa 66 was the strongest. It was while tending Sanji\u0027s wounds that Reiju placed the explosive handcuffs on him, so that his brother would blindly obey his father\u0027s orders, since he had confessed before their fight that his hands were his most precious possessions. What\u0027s more, Sanji was trapped into cooperating with his family, who had discovered Zeff\u0027s existence and risked eliminating him at any moment if he didn\u0027t obey their orders. Forced to accept, Sanji remembered that Zeff behaved like a real father, even if he didn\u0027t show him tenderness from time to time. It was by leaving Baratie that Sanji proved how much he loved his mentor, and that he would never forget him.\nSanji is jolted back to reality by Luffy\u0027s cries. He is astonished to see his friend again, as are his brothers, who are obsessed by the beauty of Nami, who is accompanying the young pirate. With a leap, Luffy clings to the carriage door and starts chatting with Sanji, who doesn\u0027t want to listen. Soon, scattered snatches of memory flash through Sanji\u0027s brain, and he begins to struggle against himself. He\u0027s torn between saving Zeff and staying with the Straw Hat Crew. Seeing he had no way out, he reacts coldly to Luffy\u0027s words and kicks him out of the royal carriage. He tells Nami and Luffy to leave, calling them low-life pirates. His friends don\u0027t understand his attitude and are astonished to learn that Sanji has accepted his royal status by calling himself Vinsmoke Sanji, Prince of the Kingdom of Germa!\n\nStill shocked by Sanji\u0027s words, Luffy asks him to clarify things. His friend then declares that he wants his companions to leave. Under the watchful eye of his family, he thanks them for their efforts to reach him, but tells them that their efforts were in vain. Sanji goes on to compare the size and wealth of Big Mom\u0027s Crew to that of the Straw Hats, saying that it\u0027s obvious that the Empress\u0027s side is the best choice for him and that he can\u0027t wait to marry his beloved daughter. He even doubts that Luffy will ever become King of the Pirates, prompting Nami to tell him that he\u0027s gone too far. When, in response, he glares at her, Nami is speechless.\n\nSanji asks Luffy to go away and forget him, but the Straw Hat refuses. Vinsmoke Yonji wants to rebuke the young pirate\u0027s words, but Sanji stops him, saying it was his business. He then climbs down from the royal carriage and advances towards Luffy, who remains motionless in front of him. The Straw Hat takes advantage of this moment to ask his friend if the time they\u0027ve spent together so far had always been a lie. Sanji replies that it took them long enough to understand, and that he was embarrassed to be associated with them for so long. As all the members of the Vinsmoke Family listen, he declares that he is obliged to engrave this truth in Luffy\u0027s head and prepares to use his \u0022Devil\u0027s Leg\u0022, astonishing the soldiers of Germa 66 at the sight of the flames emanating from his right foot.\n\nRealizing he was serious, Luffy prepares to confront him when Sanji rushes towards him. He launches a \u0022Cheek Shot\u0022 directly into Luffy\u0027s face, sending him flying and knocking out a tooth. Luffy recovers quickly and lands on his feet, much to Sanji\u0027s astonishment. His friend asks him if he\u0027s ready to fight, but Luffy refuses to use his Haki and decides to fight his friend anyway. Sanji accepts the fight and orders Luffy to disappear from his sight. But the Straw Hat refuses, which earns him another kick in the face. Once again, Luffy quickly recovers from this attack and gets back on his feet. As Luffy gets to his feet, Sanji has a flashback to the time when Luffy asked him to join his crew. For her part, perched atop King Baum, Nami begs Sanji to stop, explaining that they only went through all that in order to bring him back, including the fight with a Big Mom commander that had lasted all night. Luffy, however, asks him to keep quiet, telling him not to interfere as he had challenged Sanji to a duel. Feeling insulted to learn that their confrontation was merely a duel, Sanji resumed his \u0022Diable Jambe\u0022 assault on Luffy, while the latter continued not to defend himself. Despite the blows he was receiving, Luffy remained on his feet as Nami looked on in horror. Sanji ordered the Straw Hat to leave, but Luffy replied, his face bloodied, that he would never leave without him. Seeing that he had a tough opponent who would not listen to reason, Sanji leaps high into the air to prepare his final attack. Nami begs him to stop, and tells him they\u0027ll even leave. Luffy, however, reaffirms that he won\u0027t move an inch from where he is, leading Sanji to another flashback in which he sees Luffy again asking him to come with him. Sanji then lands on Luffy\u0027s skull with a \u0022Crush\u0022 that knocks out the Straw Hat.\n\nThe soldiers of Germa 66 are impressed by Sanji\u0027s strength and are convinced that Vinsmoke blood does indeed run in his veins. After defeating Luffy, Sanji returns to his family, leaving the Straw Hat in a pool of blood. Nami, concerned about her friend\u0027s fate, climbs down from King Baum to run to Luffy to see if he\u0027s all right and begs him not to die, shaking him vigorously in all directions. Noticing that Luffy is still unconscious, Nami gets up and catches Sanji before he can get into his carriage. She slaps him, leaving a mark on his face, and bids him farewell, annoyed, calling him \u0022Lord Sanji\u0022. The latter is unable to look her in the eye, and Jajji concludes that Sanji has finally broken with his pirate past. The former cook of the Straw Hat Crew climbs back into the royal carriage, which sets off again immediately. As the convoy pulls away, Sanji is shocked by what he had done to his friend. At this point, Luffy regains his senses. He gets up and, despite his serious injuries, doesn\u0027t believe his former crew member\u0027s words, as he\u0027s never heard Sanji say anything so untrue. For his part, Sanji hides his face in his hands, and shows an increasing amount of anguish at Luffy\u0027s words. The latter continues to remind Sanji of all they\u0027ve been through together, and makes him understand that recent events aren\u0027t enough to make him turn his back on his friend. Luffy then declares that he wasn\u0027t the one who suffered most when Sanji hit him, which brings Sanji to tears. Nami tries to dissuade her captain, saying that Sanji has gone too far, but Luffy continues to call out to his friend. Reiju asks Sanji if they should stop again, but he tells her to keep moving. For his part, Luffy remembers that Sanji once told him about All Blue and his desire to discover this magical place. Armed with this argument, the Straw Hat reminds his friend that their adventures had only just begun, and declares that he won\u0027t budge an inch until Sanji returns. He even decides to go on hunger strike until his friend returns, not wanting to eat anything other than Sanji\u0027s cooking. Niji and Yonji laugh to see their brother in tears as he recalls his childhood abuse at the hands of his brothers. Behind him, Luffy tells him that he\u0027ll wait as long as it takes for Sanji to change his mind, because he can\u0027t become King of the Pirates without his faithful cook...",

        "description": "In her castle, Big Mom learns with sorrow of the defeat of Charlotte Cracker, who has always been undefeated until now. Having struck down her messengers, she vows revenge by eliminating Luffy.\nAt the same time, Luffy is with Nami at the very spot where they left Sanji. The Straw Hat is lying on the ground, breathing heavily after the severe beating he received from his ex-friend. Nami is standing next to him, speechless as she tries to understand what is happening to them. The young woman asks Luffy if he really wants to stay here and wait for Sanji to feed him, and his answer is affirmative, despite his more than vulnerable position in enemy territory. Her friend reminds him of Pound\u0027s words and of the consequences of defeating a defeated Sweet Commander: Big Mom\u0027s revenge. This comes in the form of a storm, initiated by the Homies Zeus and Prometheus. King Baum, who always accompanies the two pirates, is frightened by the approaching storm, which is a sign that Big Mom is in a very bad mood. The members of the Vinsmoke family witness the phenomenon, but Sanji, lost in thought, pays little attention to it.\n\nAs violent winds rage across Tougato Island, the Vinsmoke convoy arrives at the entrance to Big Mom\u0027s Castle just as the Empress\u0027s Enraged Army is coming out to avenge Cracker. Sanji stands frozen in awe as his brothers marvel at the number of men deployed to wash away Big Mom\u0027s affront, and recognize some of the celebrities among them, such as Mont d\u0027Or, Opera, Galette, Amande and Bobbin the Exterminator, whose promised bounties on their heads are exorbitant. Sanji is flabbergasted and thinks of Luffy, who is still there waiting for him to come back.\n\nAfter the last of the Enraged Army\u0027s soldiers have passed through, a violent downpour washes over the Vinsmoke carriage and the whole island. Nami discovers that the rain was in fact syrup. Luffy, on discovering this, turns over on his stomach, refusing to taste the syrup, because what he wants is Sanji\u0027s cooking, and his decision is irrefutable!\n\nAt the same time, in the pouring rain, Baron Tamago welcomes the members of the Vinsmoke Family with the respect due to their rank, while Sanji\u0027s brothers ponder how to incorporate Big Mom\u0027s men into their army, and Vinsmoke Jajji sees his dream of uniting his family with Big Mom\u0027s about to come true. Not far away, in the corridors of her castle, Big Mom broods over her revenge, but suddenly calms down when Anana, one of her daughters, appears before her and asks for a knife to mutilate her stuffed animal. Her brothers, Dolce and Drag\u00e9e, refuse to give it to her, criticizing her, and Big Mom relativizes by saying that it\u0027s a good day, as their big sister Pudding is soon to get married. Big Mom then enters the castle\u0027s huge dining room, where all the members of the Vinsmoke family are waiting for her. They all stand up when they see their hostess arrive, except for Sanji, who remains silent. As she sits down, Big Mom notices the special bracelets around the wrists of her future son-in-law, whose identity she knows: Sanji the Black Leg. Soon, Pudding appears, accompanied by his faithful Nitro, and apologizes for his tardiness. After her daughter has taken her place among the guests, Big Mom chats with the men of the Vinsmoke family. Jajji points out that their children\u0027s happiness comes first when Big Mom talks about alliances. They are then served and their food turns out to be chatty Homies who won\u0027t stop singing to be eaten. Sitting next to Sanji, Pudding discreetly slips him a note: \u0022We need to talk privately later.\u0022\n\nOutside Sweet City, Luffy and Nami witness the arrival of the infamous Raging Army in the pouring rain. A confrontation is imminent. The Straw Hat asks his friend to hide while he personally takes care of Big Mom\u0027s troops. The young sailor obeys, but begs him to leave with her. Unfortunately, the Straw Hat refuses, fearing that Sanji will reverse his decision and no longer find him in the agreed location. Nami, who had climbed to the top of King Baum, saw countless soldiers occupying the entire plain. The battle was going to be unequal, and she knew it. Luffy couldn\u0027t defeat Big Mom\u0027s huge army on his own. But the Straw Hat was adamant he wouldn\u0027t budge an inch until Sanji returned...",

        "description": "As Nami and King Baum look on, Luffy faces Big Mom\u0027s Enraged Army alone, advancing towards him as one. The confrontation seems inevitable. The Straw Hat orders his friend to flee. But the young navigator, perched atop King Baum, refuses. However, the frightened King of the Forest of Temptation leaves her no choice but to flee.\nStill weak from his battle with Sanji, Luffy stands proudly before the army that has been sent to meet him. His adversaries are astonished that he hasn\u0027t fled at the sight of them, and know that Luffy hasn\u0027t come to Whole Cake Island alone. They order him to tell them where his friends are, but the Straw Hat refuses to tell them anything. A giant then launches an attack, but is overcome by Luffy, who is ready to fight an entire army on his own. Charlotte Mont d\u0027Or, the army\u0027s leader, can\u0027t believe his eyes: a mere human has defeated a giant! To avenge this affront, he orders all his men to attack Luffy. Luffy waits with bated breath and fights like a lion, beating all his opponents one by one using his Haki and his most tried and tested fighting techniques. He even creates a violent typhoon to sweep away all his enemies. While Luffy fights fiercely, Nami tries to convince King Baum to stop running away, but he continues to do as he pleases.\n\nMeanwhile, in Big Mom\u0027s castle, Sanji accepted Charlotte Pudding\u0027s invitation and went to her room for a private chat. He discovered that the young girl had helped her friends get to Whole Cake Island thanks to the plan she had drawn for them. Overcome with remorse, Pudding confesses to Sanji that she hadn\u0027t managed to get the Straw Hats to infiltrate properly because she couldn\u0027t wait for them on shore and that they\u0027re now in danger because of her. She goes on to tell him about the bracelets and learns that they have already been put on Sanji\u0027s wrists because his mother used to make alliances with political marriages to prevent her suitors from fleeing. Sanji knows that Big Mom has the key to opening his handcuffs, and to get it, he\u0027ll have to defeat his entire crew. Pudding is frightened by this admission and tries to dissuade him, but to no avail. Then Sanji confides in Pudding, revealing his precarious situation within the Vinsmoke family and his bloated face following his reunion with his brothers. The only time Sanji was truly happy in his life was when he was away from his family. But since his return, he\u0027s been going through hell, and he doesn\u0027t want to run away anymore if he doesn\u0027t want to risk the lives of his loved ones, especially Zeff, his adoptive father, who still lives in East Blue. After weighing up the pros and cons, Sanji decides to finally accept his fate.\n\nNot far away, Luffy continues to fight against the Enraged Army, using every trick in the book to defeat his adversaries. Mont d\u0027Or, who has witnessed his battles, believes that Luffy will be hard to beat. But Charlotte Opera doesn\u0027t agree, and goes on the attack despite her brother\u0027s refusal. He manages to engulf her in fresh cream which, as it hardens, burns her limbs. Luffy manages to free himself, but has to face Bobbin and his hypnotic power. Bobbin hypnotizes him and Luffy is on the verge of losing his life if Nami hadn\u0027t returned to the rescue after forcing King Baum to obey her after using Laura\u0027s Life Card. Using her climatic stick, she distracts Bobbin while Luffy quickly comes to his senses. His adversaries notice that the Straw Hat has allies once again: Nami and King Baum. The latter is called a traitor, even though he was helping the young sailor against her will.\n\nDespite King Baum\u0027s pleas, Mont d\u0027Or launches a second attack. For her part, Nami is ready, as is Luffy, who knows that a new battle is about to begin. At the same time, in the Mirror World, Chopper and Carrot are trapped by Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e\u0027s henchmen, who had managed to capture them. At the mercy of their adversaries, they try to escape, but are caught by Randolph and his crane, who attempt to kill Carrot. She is saved in extremis by Chopper, who had transformed to block Randolph\u0027s attack. Armed with this advantage, the young reindeer defeats his adversary and invites his friend to flee while he personally takes care of Br\u00fbl\u00e9e.\n\nMeanwhile, outside Sweet City, the battle between Luffy and the Enraged Army continues. Supported by Nami, the Straw Hat is making mincemeat of his enemies. But Mont d\u0027Or\u0027s men target King Baum with their dusils, and some climb to the top to surround Nami. Just as they were about to capture her, they were stopped by a mysterious force emanating from Nami\u0027s Life Card. Bg Mom\u0027s essence had saved the young woman from certain death and kept her opponents at bay. Charlotte Galette, who accompanied the Chess soldiers, doesn\u0027t understand what\u0027s happening to them. For his part, Luffy uses his Haki to fight three giants at once, but is attacked from behind by Charlotte Opera, who once again uses her special cream to immobilize the Chapeau de Paille. Caught in a pincer movement, Luffy is attacked from all sides. Aware of his situation, Charlotte Opera orders the young pirate to give up.\n\nAt the same time, Sanji continues to talk to Pudding, confiding that if he agreed to the marriage, Big Mom would let his friends go, when in fact she wanted to eliminate Luffy and his companions. For her part, Pudding feels responsible for the situation and Sanji does everything he can to console her. He reveals to her that he had to flee for 13 years, and that he finally came back, more grown up than ever after meeting people who had perfected his culinary skills, as well as trusted friends with whom he had set sail to discover the world. He decided to put an end to his adventures, accepting his fate as long as he didn\u0027t hurt his friends or cause them to be hurt. To his astonishment, Pudding bursts into tears.\n\nOn the battlefield, Luffy is at the mercy of Charlotte Opera. He orders the three giants to finish the job. Luffy manages to escape, but is attacked once again by Mont d\u0027Or\u0027s soldiers. He eliminates them one by one, while Nami uses her climatic staff to provoke a storm in order to strike down her opponents. But she finds that this tactic is not very effective. However, she finds salvation in watching the lightning zap the sky above her.\n\nNot far away, in Pudding\u0027s room, Sanji\u0027s bride began to cry. The former cook of the Straw Hat Crew couldn\u0027t understand her reaction. She confessed that she didn\u0027t want their marriage to be a new hell for him. Sanji thinks the opposite. At the same time, Nami activates a Weather Egg to use the stormy weather to her advantage, and it works. Nami manages to create a large electric cloud that blasts all Luffy\u0027s enemies in a single blow, before Mont d\u0027Or\u0027s horrified eyes! As Luffy rises to his feet, he realizes that he was saved by the ingenuity of his friend, who had used her meteorological talents to win the first round.\n\nFar from the tumult, in Pudding\u0027s room, Sanji manages to comfort her by taking her in his arms and agrees to marry Pudding for the following day...",

He knocks out every enemy with consummate ease, but has to contend with Charlotte Mascarpone and her sister Charlotte Joscarpone, who prove to be formidable adversaries. Seeing that her friend was about to be outnumbered, Nami unleashes the wrath of heaven on the Enraged Army using her climatic staff. But Charlotte Galette puts a stop to this and manu militari brings Nami down from King Baum, while Amande, a member of Big Mom\u0027s crew, climbs the trunk of the King of the Forest of Temptation to kill him by slicing him in half with a single sword stroke!\nFor his part, the Straw Hat continues his carnage among the troops sent against him. However, Charlotte Mont d\u0027Or, perched on flying books, observes Luffy and is amazed by such unnatural strength. For her part, Nami is completely at the mercy of Charlotte Galette, but she sees Luffy in the distance, who is violently attacked by Charlotte Opera, who wants to imprison the young pirate in her cream, which bursts into flames at the slightest touch.\n\nAt the same time, in the Mirror World, Chopper and Carrot are confronted by Randolph and Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, who surround them. Charlotte is astonished by the young reindeer\u0027s sudden transformation, but doesn\u0027t even bother. She orders Diesel and Noble Croco to attack the two intruders. Chopper quickly defeats the talking crocodile, while Carrot makes light work of his wheeled opponent. Faced with this defeat, Br\u00fbl\u00e9e tries to kill the Mink with her scythe by emerging from a mirror behind Carrot. But Chopper saves his friend at the last second, while Br\u00fbl\u00e9e unintentionally frees her victims from their chains. Suddenly, doubles of Carrot and Chopper rush out of the mirrors to catch the originals. Defeated, Chopper and Carrot are once again Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e\u0027s prisoners.\n\nFor his part, Luffy is still battling with Charlotte Opera. To free himself from her diabolical cream, the young pirate is forced to use an Elephant Gun to defeat his adversary. However, he doesn\u0027t have the time, as Charlotte Mont d\u0027Or, who had been watching the whole scene from above, activates her power to imprison Luffy in a book! The Straw Hat then finds himself in a strange world where everything has no head or tail. Mont d\u0027Or appears and tells him that Luffy has entered the World of Books. In the real world, Nami observes her friend struggling, unable to understand what is happening to him as he is attacked from all sides, both in the real world and in the imaginary world into which Mont d\u0027Or has plunged him. Soon, overwhelmed by the number of attackers he had to contend with, and under Nami\u0027s helpless eyes, the young pirate was defeated and lost consciousness as he fell face-down on the floor.\n\nNot far away, in the castle of Whole Cake Island, Sanji is invited to Big Mom\u0027s table. He manages to negotiate a compromise with the Empress: let his friends go in exchange for his marriage to Pudding. The mistress of the house accepts his proposal, while continuing to stuff her face in front of him if Sanji gives up the idea of running away and getting married without resisting. Sanji is relieved by this turn of events and solemnly promises Big Mom to make his beloved daughter happy. However, the Empress tells her that what her friends had done - destroying the Forest of Temptation and defeating her Sweet Commanders - was unforgivable, as was devouring the huge stock of sweets on Fish Island and defying her. Yet she\u0027s willing to let it go if Sanji agrees to marry Pudding. The former cook of the Straw Hat Crew accepts without batting an eyelid.\n\nFor his part, Luffy is still lying unconscious. As Nami looks out over the desolate battlefield, Charlotte Galette undoes her blouse and takes the Life Card from her possession. She understands that it was thanks to this object that Nami had managed to emerge alive from the Forest of Temptation and defeat all her Homies opponents, then discovers that this Life Card belongs to Charlotte Laura. On hearing the name, Bobbin deduces that Nami had killed her, a claim the young sailor vehemently denies. As the victorious Enraged Army returns to the castle, abandoning the Chess soldiers who had perished in battle, Charlotte Counter reaches Luffy and pulls him up by his clothes, taking him with her. But the Straw Hat, who had regained consciousness, refused to move, clinging firmly to the ground. Excited, Big Mom\u0027s son takes a hard line and violently punches the young pirate before Nami\u0027s horrified eyes, who asks Counter to stop. Despite all his determination, Luffy was forced to let go, abandoning his promise to Sanji to wait for him here no matter what...",

However, he had come across Big Mom\u0027s army and hoped his friends were still safe. He had no idea that his companions had been captured by the Empress\u0027 men, who had imprisoned them in a book! Much to Nami\u0027s relief, Luffy comes to and finds he\u0027s been taken prisoner. The person responsible for this setback is none other than Charlotte Mont d\u0027Or. Surrounded by Charlotte Opera, Bobbin and Charlotte Galette, he informs his \u0022guests\u0022 that they are in the Prison Library of Big Mom\u0027s Castle and that no prisoner has yet managed to escape before closing the prison\u0027s huge cover over them.\nAt the same time, in the Mirror World, Chopper and Carrot have their hands full with their clones, Homies created by Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, who attack them mercilessly. But soon they find themselves surrounded by Br\u00fbl\u00e9e\u0027s henchmen, who decide to capture them alive and chain them so they can\u0027t escape her. However, Chopper has a plan that just might save them...\n\nFar from the turmoil, Brook uses his powers to infiltrate the heavily guarded castle treasure room. He informs Pedro that he has spotted three Poneglyphs and overhears Tamago talking to Charlotte Smoothie, a Sweet Commander, about the Poneglyphs held by Big Mom\u0027s Crew: two Poneglyphs and one Road Poneglyph. One of them is even a gift from Jinbei himself! If we can get our hands on all four Road Poneglyphs, we\u0027ll reach Raftel safely, where the secret of the world will be revealed. Brook, who continues to eavesdrop on their conversation, reports their words to Pedro, who knows that Tamago is aware of his presence on the island. However, the Mink wants to take advantage of this situation and offers, at the risk of his own life, to act as bait while Brook tries to steal the Road Poneglyph that will enable Luffy to one day become King of the Pirates.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Mirror World, Chopper and Carrot are taken to Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e\u0027s house. There, Charlotte plans to cook the Mink Lapine, suspended over a large pot of simmering water, as Randolph and several Homies look on. Chopper also attends, also unable to move. Br\u00fbl\u00e9e tells him he\u0027ll soon be joining Big Mom\u0027s collection of strange beasts. The reindeer is in \u0022Heavy Point\u0022 and realizes that his only chance is to turn into a \u0022Monster Point\u0022. While Br\u00fbl\u00e9e\u0027s acolytes salivate in anticipation as they watch Carrot cry his eyes out, Chopper prepares to launch his plan.\n\nNot far away, in Big Mom\u0027s Library, the mistress of the house invites the Vinsmoke Family to visit her library, where her son captures many types of humanoids and beasts inside the books. Big Bom announces that as long as they\u0027re in the books, they can live forever. During the visit, Vinsmoke Jajji remarks that he hadn\u0027t seen any Giants on the Totland Archipelago. A remark that irritates Big Mom until a guard comes to tell her that Luffy and Nami have been captured. While Nami demands a shower to get rid of the gooey syrup covering her body, Luffy, still imprisoned in a book, is visited by Big Mom\u0027s first son, Charlotte Perospero, and makes contact via a snail phone bearing Big Mom\u0027s effigy. Straw Hat provokes Yonko despite her condition, but Yonko pays little attention. She just tells him she\u0027s going to finish him off. But Luffy, determined to find Sanji, warns him that he is ready to fight Big Mom on the spot...",

        "description": "Using a snail phone, Luffy challenges Big Mom to single combat and asks her to come and fight him on the spot. But she reminds him that he\u0027s just a Rookie who\u0027s ventured into the New World and doesn\u0027t deserve to have a real discussion with her. What\u0027s more, she points out that her children can take care of him themselves. But Big Mom has a heart and offers to give up the idea of getting Sanji in exchange for his life. But Luffy refuses. Yet Big Mom continues to warn him. She doesn\u0027t want the marriage she\u0027s been looking forward to to fall through. She ends by reminding him that among the treasures Luffy gave him on Pisces Island was the Tamatebako, a box that has been handed down from generation to generation among the Pisces. She wonders why King Neptune wanted to part with it, then decides to open the box in front of all his Tea Party guests. Luffy yells at her that Sanji will never marry, then asks to meet Pudding, who he says is his friend. He is rebuffed by Perospero, who asks him to calm down. Big Mom then turns to Nami and asks whether or not she killed her daughter Laura. The young sailor tells her that Laura is in fact her friend and that it was she who gave her the Life Card, and that if she showed it to her mother, she would help her. What Nami hadn\u0027t imagined, however, was that Laura\u0027s mother was Empress Big Mom. The Yonko suddenly loses her temper and says she\u0027d rather see Laura dead. She asks Nami where she is so she can send an assassin. She announces that Laura was involved in an arranged marriage to increase the power of Big Mom\u0027s crew. What\u0027s more, she claims she could have defeated the other Emperors and even become Queen of the Pirates. Big Mom again orders Nami to tell them where her daughter is, or face the worst consequences. Luffy reacts to Big Mom\u0027s \u0022misfortunes\u0022 and solemnly announces that he will defeat her and get Sanji back.\nAt the same time, Sanji is languishing in his guest room. He hopes all his friends are well and asks them to leave as they arrived. Not far away, in the heavily guarded treasure room, all Big Mom\u0027s men are on the lookout. Pedro stands in the shadows, ready for action. He eliminates all the guards in his path to enter the treasure room. The intrusion is signaled by snail phone and reinforcements are immediately sent to stop him. The Mink-Jaguar easily eliminates them and attempts to break down the heavy treasure room door with explosives, but to no avail. At the same time, in the treasure room, Baron Tamago receives a snail phone call from a guard announcing Pedro\u0027s arrival. For her part, Charlotte Smoothie decides to take action and orders the Chess soldiers to open the door for her. Tamago tries to dissuade her, but to no avail. The door opens and they realize that all the soldiers outside the room have been beaten! Tamago is furious and orders his men to catch up with the intruder.\n\nMeanwhile, Sanji paces back and forth in his room, wondering about the advantages of marrying Pudding, before promising himself not to disappoint her. Besides, he\u0027s fallen madly in love with her and wants to make her happy. Pudding, meanwhile, is in his room, chatting to a maid who is dutifully ironing his wedding dress. She tells him everything that\u0027s going on in the castle and that the dress the girl had chosen the day before was not suitable for her mother. Pudding doesn\u0027t care and leaves her room in spite of the rain. She remembers all the times her mother had given her instructions for her wedding, treating her like a doll. Yet she remembers her big sister Laura, who had gone on an adventure when she was very little and decided to freely choose whom she would marry. Pudding didn\u0027t have the same strength as her sister and had to submit to her mother\u0027s demands.\n\nThe latter is always in conversation with Luffy. Big Mom ignores the young pirate\u0027s provocations and ends the discussion, despite the fact that Luffy hasn\u0027t finished talking to her. Big Mom\u0027s children laugh at Luffy\u0027s provocations. Suddenly, the door to the prison library opens. Their younger brother, Charlotte Anglais, comes to announce that the treasure room has been attacked by an intruder. Charlotte Mont d\u0027Or is not worried, as he knows the room is heavily defended by Tamago and Smoothie. However, he doesn\u0027t want this news to reach Big Mom\u0027s ears. The latter has held an audience in her room, where all her visitors are amazed that she isn\u0027t angry at the provocations made by the Straw Hat. Big Mom is in a joyful mood, as she can\u0027t wait for the wedding to begin. After the ceremony, she\u0027ll be able to take over the Germa 66 technology, reveal the contents of the Tamatebako and, icing on the cake, taste the best wedding cake ever made! But her joy is short-lived when Napoleon, her pirate hat, informs her, after picking up waves, that an intruder has dared to enter the treasure room. This news infuriates Big Mom, while all the Homies around her continue to sing as if nothing had happened. She puts an abrupt end to the party, thinking that the intruder is about to steal her precious Tamatebako.\n\nIn the corridors of Big Mom\u0027s castle, Pedro tries to lose his pursuers, slowing them down by throwing explosives at them. For their part, Tamago and Smoothie are on the hunt to neutralize the Mink, while Brook, hiding behind a door, prepares to take action by drawing his sword from its scabbard and announcing that it\u0027s time for a special concert...",

        "description": "Unbeknownst to the pursuing guards, Pedro continues to make his way through the castle corridors, using his dynamite sticks to keep the soldiers out of his way, and slays a large number of opponents with his sword with disconcerting speed. In reality, it\u0027s a diversionary tactic, and Tamago, who is chasing him, understands this. He first orders the soldiers to corner Pedro in the garden, then explains to Charlotte Smoothie that there is a second intruder who will probably try to seize the Poneglyph in the treasure room. Indeed, he remembers Brook, who managed to get into the room before the heavy doors closed, ousting several soldiers who were no match for his fencing skills.\nFor her part, Charlotte Smoothie, who wanted to retrace her steps, finds herself trapped in front of the treasure room whose doors are double-locked. She realizes that there is a second intruder, and agrees with Tamago that Pedro\u0027s presence in the castle is just a decoy that will allow his accomplice to seize the Road Poneglyph! Tamago tells him to wait for Brook to come out (if he does) before beating him, but without killing him, as Big Mom might want to get hold of such a singular individual. The living skeleton faces the Chess soldiers, fearsome homies whose soul Pedro had told him Big Mom had infused into them. Brook sees this as their weak point and, as they attack him, he takes out his electric guitar and plays a few notes supposedly exuding the strength of his soul, subduing the soldiers to the point of incapacitating a few of them, while a greenish light rises behind him in the shape of Brook\u0027s face, to symbolize his soul in action.\n\nAt the same time, in his room, Sanji sees one of Big Mom\u0027s subordinates advising him to go and pick flowers in the castle courtyard for his bride, and the playful prince complies on the spot. The reason for his sudden happiness is Charlotte Pudding, of whom he thinks back fondly. Meanwhile, a pulley system is the focus of homies\u0027 attention in Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e\u0027s house in Mirror World. Chopper, chained, sees his friend Carrot suspended from a rope that slides slowly towards a boiling pot. All around him, he sees the Homies eager to eat the rabbit. Or so everyone thinks. In reality, Chopper knows that the hanging Carrot is actually a frog that has taken on the appearance of Carrot because of Mira Mira no Mi, and that the real Carrot is hiding in the attic right now, lending her voice to her double. Br\u00fbl\u00e9e orders Randolph to cut the rope, and the Homie responds (which is rare) before complying. However, just as the rope is about to be cut, the real Carrot throws a stone from the attic, causing Randolph to wobble and then grab hold of the frog. Still dazed by the shock, Randolph tries again to cut the rope, and succeeds, but Carrot jumps and lands on the edge of the pot, tipping the container dangerously towards Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, who is immediately scalded by the pot\u0027s contents. Br\u00fbl\u00e9e writhes in pain from the heat of the soup, while Carrot gets to his feet after saving the frog. For his part, Chopper frees himself by changing form, then crunches a Rumble Ball to put himself in Monster Point for a counter-attack. His opponents, seeing him take this new form, become frightened and want to flee.\n\nNot far away, in the castle\u0027s library-prison, Luffy continues to protest, exasperating the patience of Charlotte Opera, who was there to keep an eye on him. Suddenly, Charlotte Pudding enters the room, much to her brother\u0027s surprise. The latter allows her sister to enter the prisoners\u0027 cell, as she wants to talk to Luffy and Nami. She arrives at their level, apologizing profusely because she knows that members of the Charlotte Family have done nothing but bad things to them. She goes on to reveal that Sanji has proposed to her. While she\u0027s talking to them, Sanji, very much in love with Big Mom\u0027s daughter, is picking roses to give to his fianc\u00e9e. For their part, Luffy and Nami are stunned to realize that their friend has definitively given up any attempt at a comeback...",

The latter, seeing the worried look on their faces, tells her friends that she won\u0027t marry Sanji for a reason she whispers in their ears. This indiscretion literally petrifies the two pirates. Pudding emerges from the cell, but Luffy orders her to stay. The girl turns around and says, tearfully, \u0022Goodbye\u0022.\nMeanwhile, in the guest room assigned to the Vinsmoke, gathered around a cup of tea, family members confer after noticing the sudden disappearance of Vinsmoke Reiju. After Sanji\u0027s marriage, he and his wife go to live in the Kingdom of Germa: Vinsmoke Jajji approves of this, as it gives them a \u0022hostage\u0022 from Big Mom in case she imposes anything else on them. Vinsmoke Niji points out that Big Mom\u0027s crew could do the same thing on their own, but Vinsmoke Ichiji reminds him that the loss of Sanji won\u0027t affect them.\n\nAt the same time, in Sanji\u0027s room, he is arranging the bouquet of roses he wants to give to Pudding. He receives a visit from one of Big Mom\u0027s subordinates, who brings him the requested ingredients and delivers some news: Luffy and Nami have been captured, while Pedro and Brook are sowing discord throughout the castle. Sanji is astonished that Nami and Luffy have been detained, even though Big Mom had assured him of their freedom. Nevertheless, he decides to cook for Pudding with the ingredients brought to him. Meanwhile, in Mirror World, Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e is writhing in boiling water. Her sidekicks, led by Randolph, try to rescue her, but are electrocuted by Carrot. For his part, Chopper, using the \u0022Monster Point\u0022, overcomes Noble Croco, who crashes into his accomplices. Realizing that things were getting out of hand, Diesel takes off. He is caught by Carrot, who puts him out of action. Chopper, back in his usual form, is delighted to have defeated the Br\u00fbl\u00e9e group with Carrott\u0027s help. The little reindeer decides to use Br\u00fbl\u00e9e\u0027s mirrors to travel across the island and find his companions.\n\nFor his part, Brook continues his frenzied show, petrifying his enemies with Soul King\u0027s soul cry. But he still has to contend with the men who are impervious to his vocal talents, and a fierce battle ensues between the living skeleton and Big Mom\u0027s battle-hardened soldiers. But Brook has the upper hand, taking out his opponents one by one using his most powerful fighting techniques. Suddenly, Brook spots on the floor the keys to the room where the Poneglyphs are kept. He tries to seize them, but is prevented from doing so by a man-at-arms who wants to skewer him. In the end, he triumphs and takes the keys, hoping that Pedro has escaped. Outside, Big Mom, in a very bad mood, heads for the treasure room.\n\nAt the same time, Charlotte Smoothie knocks frantically on the door of the room and realizes that all the guards inside have been beaten. For his part, Brook manages to open the cage where the Road Poneglyph is locked up, thanks to the keys he has managed to steal. As Smoothie continues to knock on the door, she hears her mother\u0027s footsteps. Her annoyed mother pushes her daughter aside and opens the door to the treasure room, pulverizing it with her powers. Big Mom enters the room and immediately goes in search of the intruder. Brook, trapped, sees the Empress and is petrified with fear! For her part, Big Mom seems ecstatic at the sight of the living skeleton.\n\nMeanwhile, a strange shadow roams the castle. It\u0027s Reiju who, after jumping into an inner courtyard, reaches Pudding\u0027s room. But someone shoots him at point-blank range! Far from this tragedy, Pedro continues to fight against Big Mom\u0027s men, whom he overcomes with ease. But he finds himself completely surrounded, and is forced to enter an inner courtyard of the castle, pressed by his pursuers. It\u0027s here that Pedro meets up with Baron Tamago. Baron Tamago tells him that they haven\u0027t seen each other for five years, and adds that Pedro is the captain of the Pirates of Nox. The two adversaries reveal their left eye: completely scarred from their fight five years ago. Tamago is surprised that Pedro is back, because the last time he came to Tougato, Big Mom had taken fifty years off his life expectancy! Despite this, Pedro assumes his return and tells her that he has no intention of returning to Zou alive without having accomplished his mission. At the same time, in a castle corridor, Reiju is badly wounded and staggers to her feet. She tries to make her way back to her room, but her blood flows profusely and she finally collapses, gasping for breath.\n\nMeanwhile, as Nami watches in amazement, Luffy tries to free himself from his prison, but to no avail.

Finally, Chopper and Carrot order Diesel, who transports them with Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e tied up and unconscious, to take them to a mirror leading to the castle. But Br\u00fbl\u00e9e\u0027s associate has no idea where in Mirror World such a mirror could be.\nAt the same time, while Charlotte Opera is reading a book, Luffy tries to get out of his cell, but his hands are nailed to the wall. Under Nami\u0027s frightened eyes, the Straw Hat stretches as best he can, but his friend points out that if he continues, he\u0027s bound to lose his arms. Luffy is desperate to escape, but in the end, the combination of strength and elasticity twists him around, sending him crashing into the wall. A little stunned, Luffy resumes his maneuver despite Nami\u0027s pleas.\n\nMeanwhile, in the castle corridors, Vinsmoke Reiju, seriously wounded in the left leg, desperately tries to get back to her room, but collapses on the floor, exhausted. Suddenly, Pudding appears and seems horrified to see Reiju in such a state. Not far away, in the heart of the castle, Big Mom is now standing at the bottom of the treasure room, telling Brook to abandon his attempt to copy the Poneglyph and go downstairs. The living skeleton complies immediately, arrogantly declaring that he will defeat Big Mom and then get the Road Poneglyph at the risk of his life, all the while drawing his blade. Faced with this provocation, Big Mom activates her power and summons Zeus and Prometheus, a cloud and a sun to which she has instilled a particle of her soul, as well as Napoleon, her homie bicorne, to fight with her Brook.\n\nNot far away, in the courtyard on the third floor of Whole Cake Ch\u00e2teau, a duel between Pedro - whose bounty is set at 382,000,000 Berries - and Tamago - with a bounty of 429,000,000 Berries - is about to begin. The two pirates charge at each other, Tamago fighting with his long legs and cane. He reveals to his adversary that he is protected from his electric shocks by clothes made of a material that makes him invulnerable to Electro. As he battles against him, Pedro recalls the last time he ventured onto Whole Cake Island with the Pirates of Nox and his reunion with Pekoms, who has become a member of Big Mom\u0027s Crew. Pedro and Zepo, one of his comrades, came to steal Poneglyphs but were captured by the Empress\u0027s guards. The Mink Leopard, however, would not be denied, and fought like mad against the head of the guard, Baron Tamago. An epic duel ensued, and Pedro managed to poke Tamago\u0027s eye out, losing his left eye in the process. Suddenly, a thud was heard. It was Big Mom ordering the arrest of the two Minks. Back in the present, the two pirates continue to fight and Tamago confesses that his lost left eye sometimes itches. As for Pedro, who has also lost an eye, he remembers his audience with Big Mom. She had killed Zepo using a roulette wheel which indicated that his friend should lose a hundred years of life expectancy. But as Zepo only had 30 years to live, she decided to take 70 years of life from Pedro. But Pekoms, present at the hearing, begged Big Mom to spare him. The Yonko agreed and proposed to the Mink Leopard to take 60 years off his life. Seeing that Big Mom was playing a game of futility, Pedro took out his own eyebrows to find out how many years of life he would save. In response, Big Mom reduced his sentence to 50 years.\n\nIn the present, Tamago hits Pedro on the leg with \u0022Legg Benedicte\u0022 and asks him why he has returned to the hellish land where his friend died and where he lost 50 years of his life. Pedro replies that it\u0027s because of his debt to the Straw Hat Crew, who had saved the lives of all the inhabitants of Zou, and adds that the Straw Hats will change the world. But Tamago doesn\u0027t believe in Pedro\u0027s ramblings and continues his duel. As Pedro fights against him, he warns Tamago that he won\u0027t die here before slicing his opponent in half...",

        "description": "Luffy once again tries to get out of his cell by stretching out his arms despite the fact that he\u0027s nailed down, and this almost horrifies Nami, who\u0027s worried about the state of his arms. The Straw Hat seems determined, however, and asserts that escaping in this way is the only way to escape death. For her part, Charlotte Opera watches in disbelief.\nIn his room, Sanji has finished cooking the packed lunch he wants to give to Pudding, but finds that he has cooked too many dishes. He adds clementines and wine, however, and sets off to knock on Pudding\u0027s bedroom door, taking with him a superb bouquet of roses for his bride. As the door is alive, she refuses him access, claiming that Pudding is doing something important. Sanji is forced not to go through, but as he lights another cigarette, he remembers that there\u0027s a balcony overlooking Pudding\u0027s room. So he decides to go there despite the pouring rain, thinking back to the time he told Pudding he\u0027d marry her. He sneaks onto a neighboring terrace and, when he reaches the balcony, Sanji thinks about putting the food through the window. Suddenly, he comes to spy on what\u0027s behind that window and, to his great surprise, discovers Pudding laughing out loud at Reiju, whom he sees from behind. Suddenly, Pudding\u0027s face changes and a third eye appears on her forehead, giving the young woman a demonic look! Pudding bursts out laughing as she tells Reiju that she won\u0027t marry Sanji and that he\u0027s a fool she\u0027s managed to fool. She goes on to tell Reiju that she is now revealing her true nature, which normally only her family knows. What\u0027s more, Big Mom is banking on her acting skills so that she can put on an act for her victims. Sanji is left speechless by this discovery.\n\nIn his cell, Luffy continues to squirm, infuriating Charlotte Opera who was quietly reading a book. He asks her to calm down, but the Straw Hat just won\u0027t let up. While banging his head on the bars of his prison, he insults Pudding loudly and swears revenge, despite Nami\u0027s pleas to stop stretching his arms so much or they\u0027ll tear. The young pirate clearly remembers Charlotte Pudding\u0027s whispered words: that she wouldn\u0027t marry Sanji because she planned to murder him during the wedding ceremony. She had said this in an unhealthy way, opening her third eye and startling the two Straw Hats. When she tearfully bid them farewell, she added \u0022you maggots\u0022 before leaving. This deception enraged Luffy, who continued to pull on his arms and swore to save Sanji at all costs.\n\nMeanwhile, in Pudding\u0027s room, Pudding boasts and reveals to Reiju, who is still seriously injured, immobilized by Nitro the Jelly and watched over by Rabian the Carpet, that this wedding ceremony is to kill all the Vinsmoke, so that Big Mom can take over the Germa 66 technology. Pudding is ecstatic as his mother\u0027s plan works perfectly. For his part, Sanji continues to listen to this, and disillusionment, anger and sadness render him totally stoic. Before he knows it, the butt of his cigarette has been put out by the rain.\n\nPudding continues her discussion. She explains to Reiju that the Vinsmoke will be killed with a candy gun she\u0027s holding right now, with which she fires a bullet through the wall to impress her prisoner. The bullets fired from this gun have the ability to penetrate the Vinsmoke\u0027s metal body, and Reiju has already experienced this: her wounds are the result of a bullet fired from this weapon. Faced with Reiju\u0027s discomfited expression, Pudding wonders how Sanji will react to his true nature, and begins to mock him with a crude imitation. She even goes so far as to reproduce the scene from his marriage proposal, when Sanji removed his mask to reveal his bloated, swollen face to his fianc\u00e9e. It was, according to Pudding, a hilarious scene! She continued to mock, assisted by the laughter of her faithful Nitro and Rabian. Outside, Sanji continued to listen, dropping his bouquet of flowers and picnic basket. He tried to relight his wet cigarette with his lighter while, in the library-prison of Big Mom\u0027s castle, Luffy, his arms around his body, continued to pull his hands away from the wall while shouting his friend\u0027s name. The latter, with tears in his eyes, had lost all illusions and was desperately trying to light his cigarette despite the driving rain...",

        "description": "Still reeling from the revelation, a dejected Sanji still hears Charlotte Pudding and her fellow homies mocking him by addressing Reiju. Suddenly, Nitro points out to his mistress that their \u0022guest\u0022 is losing a lot of blood and could die in the morning. Pudding doesn\u0027t want Reiju to die, as this would ruin Big Mom\u0027s plan and compromise the mission her mother had entrusted to her. However, Sanji\u0027s elder sister knew Pudding\u0027s secret and, to silence her for good, decided to wipe out her memory by using the powers of her Demon Fruit, the Memo Memo no Mi, on her victim.\nCharlotte Pudding suddenly thrusts her hand into Reiju\u0027s skull without causing any damage. The latter sees her hand go through her temple like butter. However, Reiju feels a strange effect. Her vision becomes blurred, and as Pudding \u0022searches\u0022 her head, the pain intensifies and Vinsmoke Jajji\u0027s daughter screams. Pudding finally extracts a strip of film: Reiju\u0027s memories materialized in images. It was Pudding who was responsible for Reiju\u0027s injury, for it was she who had shot him! To conceal her crime, the owner of Memo Memo no Mi equipped herself with a chisel and cut off part of the film corresponding to Reiju\u0027s memories of Pudding and her true nature. Now there\u0027s no danger of Reiju alerting anyone to Pudding\u0027s case, since she no longer has any compromising memories of her. Outside, Sanji had left his bouquet of roses, which was still being washed away by the rain.\n\nAt the same time, in the treasure room, Brook stood facing Big Mom and her three accompanying homies: Zeus, Prometheus and his bicorne Napoleon. He attempts a first sword attack, \u0022Gavotte Bond en Avant\u0022, but is repelled by Prometheus\u0027 fiery flames. He suffers a second setback when he attempts the \u0022Swallow Bond en Avant\u0022 attack. Undaunted, the living skeleton changes strategy and pulls out his electric guitar to try and subdue the homies, whose souls he assumes won\u0027t be able to withstand the cry of his soul. So he plays a frenzied guitar solo and his soul materializes behind him. This demonic apparition makes the three homies uncomfortable, but does not disturb them. When Brook stops playing, he realizes that Zeus, Prometheus and Napoleon have not succumbed to his music, while Big Mom notes that her \u0022host\u0022 is a good guitar player, which she sees as all the more reason to make him her own. Now it\u0027s Zeus and Prometheus\u0027 turn to attack: Brook is put out of action. But as Big Mom tries to grab him, he gets up. Taking advantage of Zeus and Prometheus\u0027 bickering, he attacks the Yonko again. Napoleon strikes back this time! The bicorne turns out to be a saber, the blade of which was hidden under his hat and comes crashing down on Brook. This cracks the Soul King\u0027s skull. Much to Big Mom\u0027s surprise, he recovers from the attack and rises to his feet, determined. The Queen of Totland then understands that Brook\u0027s real aim was to make a copy of the Road Poneglyph, not to save Sanji. The living skeleton then justifies himself by telling her that Sanji, out of his goodness, wouldn\u0027t want to come back for fear of hurting his companions, and he tells himself not to go back empty-handed and take the Poneglyph. However, Brook adds that Sanji\u0027s failure to return would be the worst-case scenario, and Big Mom implies that the worst-case scenario will happen, and it will be much worse: his companions will die. Far from being afraid, Brook is still determined to carry out his mission and continues to defy Big Mom.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Mirror World, transported by Diesel, Carrot tickles Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, who wakes up and tells them she doesn\u0027t know which mirror leads to the castle. The only solution is to ask the mirrors directly. This admission surprises Chopper and Carrot, but the little reindeer asks the mirrors which one leads to the castle, and several of them answer him, which surprises them even more! When he asks which one leads to Sanji, Luffy, Nami, Brook or Pedro, the mirrors can\u0027t visualize who the people in question are. Carrot then has the idea of drawing their portraits to show the mirrors.\n\nNot far away, in the castle\u0027s library-prison, Luffy continues to pull on his elastic arms, risking tearing them to free himself. While Charlotte Opera stared in disbelief, Nami couldn\u0027t help crying and screaming because what Luffy was doing frightened her. Far removed from these concerns, Charlotte Opera received clear orders from Big Mom for Nami to reveal Charlotte Laura\u0027s location to him. He then threatens to torture her with a shotgun if she doesn\u0027t divulge the information. However, Jinbei arrives just then and strikes Opera using the \u00225,000 Tiles: The Fist of Justice\u0022 technique. Luffy and Nami are happy to be reunited with their friend Fishman. He tells them he has come to free them and will talk to them later...",

The young woman wakes up in the Whole Cake Ch\u00e2teau infirmary and notices the presence of Sanji, who had neutralized the guard watching her sister and kept watch over her while she was unconscious. He reveals the truth about her memories and Charlotte Pudding\u0027s true intentions.\nMeanwhile, in the library-prison, Luffy and Nami are rescued by Jinbei, who burns and destroys all Charlotte Mont d\u0027Or\u0027s books, freeing all those trapped inside. No sooner has he regained his freedom than Luffy abandons Nami and Jinbei and sets off alone to find Sanji, despite the hunger in his stomach. Sanji is still at the bedside of his sister, who is gradually recovering from her attack. The latter believes him, having heard his brother\u0027s words, and tells him that she wants to undergo Big Mom\u0027s crew\u0027s plan of her own free will, before urging Sanji to flee the island with the Straw Hats. She then talks about their mother and reveals to Sanji an incident she knew as a child and had never told anyone.\n\nDelving back into her memories, Reiju confesses to Sanji that she had witnessed an argument between her parents. Sora was pregnant at the time and strongly opposed to turning her own children into emotionless killing machines! Despite her husband Vinsmoke Jajji\u0027s refusal, Sora took a special drug to prevent the genetic modification of the child she was carrying in her womb, but was prevented from doing so by the nurses. However, she had already experimented with this process when she was expecting Sanji, and it was for this reason that her son was the only one of her children to have remained truly human. In tears, Reiju told her that Sanji was a true human who had inherited Sora\u0027s emotions, and that she had never seen anyone as wonderful as him, even if his mother had become weak from the drugs she had taken while waiting for Sanji. But as far as the rest of his family was concerned, Sanji was considered the runt of Germa 66 and the disgrace of the Vinsmoke family. Beaten by his brothers, scorned and then disowned by his father, who imprisoned him with an iron mask, Sanji found all the strength he needed to revolt and leave the Kingdom of Germa for good, with the help of his sister. Reiju, the eldest of the Vinsmoke siblings, has always loved and respected her mother. She understood Sanji\u0027s great potential before anyone else, and he turned out to be the most beautiful Vinsmoke child...",

        "description": "Having escaped from the library-prison with Jinbei\u0027s help, Luffy is on his way to the second floor of the castle, but guards block his way. He neutralizes them without the slightest difficulty. However, a Big Mom pirate whom Luffy recognizes appears in front of him. It\u0027s Cadenza, one of the two brothers who simultaneously punched Luffy in the face with Haki, a few hours earlier near Sweet City and during the arrival of the \u0022Enraged Army\u0022. The Straw Hat then engaged his Gear Second to confront his opponent.\nAt the same time, one floor up, Sanji seems pensive after Reiju\u0027s revelation. She recommends that he flee. According to her, he doesn\u0027t need Germa 66 and Big Mom only wants to get hold of their scientific technology. So she has no interest in killing Zeff if Sanji runs away. Reiju adds that as for the Vinsmoke\u0027s certain death at the wedding, the whole murderous family (including her) deserves to die, and she says she accepts her fate.\n\nNot far away, in the castle courtyard, Pedro manages to cut Tamago in half, but he doesn\u0027t get rid of him just yet. Indeed, the pirate is not dead. He transforms into an egg yolk which evolves into a kind of humanoid chick named Viscount Hyoko: Tamago\u0027s evolutionary form due to his demon fruit. Tamago explains that, thanks to this new form, his sword is more powerful than when he was Baron Tamago. He is quick to demonstrate this by crossing swords with his enemy Mink, who is beginning to bite the dust.\n\nMeanwhile, in the treasure room, Brook faces Big Mom, Zeus and Prometheus. He\u0027s still determined to get a copy of the Road Poneglyph. Not to the Empress\u0027s liking, she instructs her faithful Zeus and Prometheus to attack the living skeleton with the aim of adding it to her collection. A fierce duel ensues while Pedro continues to fight Tamago, who has become very powerful thanks to his Demon Fruit, which has increased his fencing skills tenfold. But the Mink warrior once again managed to beat him by slicing him in half with his sword. But Pedro wasn\u0027t done yet. His opponent began to evolve a second time, calling himself Count Niwatori. This was too much for Pedro, who decided to put an end to his duel by using explosives, which he detonated at the risk of his life.\n\nAt the same time, on the second floor of Whole Cake Ch\u00e2teau, Luffy is about to fight Cadenza in a duel to the death. However, all his Gear Second attacks have no effect on his tough opponent. Undaunted, Luffy grabs Cadenza\u0027s neck to force him to reveal Sanji\u0027s whereabouts.\n\nNot far away, in the treasure room, Brook is stunned to find that Big Mom\u0027s skin is so tough. He gets swept away with a wave of his hand, but still has enough strength to attack Prometheus. Faced with this impertinence, Big Mom chastises Brook by beating him violently, while at the entrance to the treasure room, Charlotte Smoothie is informed by one of her men of Jinbei\u0027s betrayal, who has rallied with the Straw Hats.\n\nIn the treasure room, Big Mom holds a wounded Brook in her hand after stripping him of all his clothes. She caresses him, telling him he\u0027s put up a good fight, alluding to his defeat. She tells him he\u0027ll be no match for Zeus, Prometheus and Napoleon, his bicorne. Big Mom asserts that she has given her soul to her three entities, making them her clones. Just then, chess piece soldiers arrive to inform the Queen that Brook has been searched: there\u0027s nothing in his clothes or in the cylinder designed to copy the Road Poneglyph. Brook is humiliated and Big Mom sarcastically replies that she has suspected him for nothing. Continuing to knead Brook\u0027s afro, Big Mom says she won\u0027t let anyone take a copy of the Poneglyph as Gol D. had done before. Roger before, thanks to a power that allowed her to hear the voice of all things. She also adds that she will soon develop a tool capable of realizing this power. Charlotte Pudding then appears and her mother asks her if she has awakened the power of her third eye. The young girl replies that she is of mixed race, and Big Mom says that the blood of the three-eyed tribe runs in her veins. Brook is astonished to learn that Pudding is a member of the Three-Eyed Tribe, and Pudding is stunned to see Brook captured. She then concludes that Big Mom\u0027s plan is going according to plan and invites her mother to speak privately in her room.\n\nAt the same time, Luffy continues to question Cadenza about Sanji\u0027s whereabouts. But the Straw Hat receives no answer, as his opponent has fainted. His comrades immediately pounce on Luffy to avenge Cadenza, while in the infirmary, Reiju urges Sanji to flee. She informs him that he can leave now, as the bracelets she had put around his wrists were fake. Reiju forces Sanji to pull himself together, as he\u0027s been lucky enough to meet real friends in his life and he needs to find them. For his part, Luffy continues to search for his friend, defeating the guards blocking his way...",

        "description": "In order to defeat Baron Tamago, who is using the powers of his Demon Fruit, Pedro has no choice but to use explosives. Their explosion causes a rift in Mirror World, where the Mink-Leopard finds Chopper and Carrot. Pedro is astonished to find his friends in this strange place, while Count Niwatori, who was unharmed, orders his men to extinguish the flames and take the wounded to the infirmary, while he broods over his anger at having let Pedro escape. The latter receives explanations from Chopper and Carrot, who tell him that they saw him through a mirror and called out to him so that he could enter Mirror World before the force of the blast reached him and mortally wounded him. For his part, Chopper reveals to Pedro that nothing can get in or out without Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e and, consequently, they are safe. Transported by Diesel, Pedro tells his companions that Luffy and Nami have been captured, while Carrot asks the mirrors to find Nami, Luffy, Brook and Sanji by showing them roughly drawn portraits of their friends. Suddenly, a mirror replies that it has seen Nami with the \u0022boss\u0022 Jinbei. At the mention of this name, Chopper is speechless.\nMeanwhile, on the third floor of the Whole Cake Ch\u00e2teau, Luffy continues to search for Sanji and fights off a handful of guards blocking his way. Suddenly, a burly man appears. It\u0027s Charlotte Cabalette, Cadenza\u0027s brother, whom the Straw Hat had managed to defeat earlier. A violent battle ensues between the two adversaries. Luffy and Cabalette are of equal strength, but the Straw Hat is caught by his enemy, who suffocates him under his powerful arm. Believing his last hour to have come, Luffy has a thought for Sanji. Cabalette, who knew the name, informs his victim that Sanji is an infamous traitor and deserved no compassion. Insulted by such words, Luffy managed to loosen Cabalette\u0027s grip while shouting at him not to speak ill of his friend. Then, turning around, he inflicts his opponent with a fearsome, anger-driven thrashing that sends Cabalette\u0027s head smashing into a wall!\n\nHaving triumphed over Cabalette, Luffy continues his search, still pursued by Big Mom\u0027s guards. Hunger-stricken, the Straw Hat shouts out his friend\u0027s name, but to no avail. Meanwhile, on the third floor, Sanji wanders the corridors carrying a basket. Unaware of the guards running about, Sanji sits down on a bench and remembers the words spoken by his sister Reiju when she was in the infirmary. She was imploring him to leave Germa 66 and go back to his comrades, who, according to her, are the best friends in the world.\n\nMeanwhile, Jinbei and Nami have left the library-prison and reached the second floor of the Whole Cake Ch\u00e2teau, where they come face to face with men-at-arms. They are about to be surrounded by guards. Nami takes care of a group of guards by striking them with Thunder Cloud Rods, but also strikes Chopper, who was in their group after spotting her friend and Jinbei whizzing past a mirror! Nami is astonished by this apparition. She suddenly sees Carrot through a mirror. The Mink-Rabbit begs Nami and Jinbe to follow her through the mirror as quickly as possible.\n\nAt the same time, Luffy continues to advance, eliminating one by one the guards who were trying to block his path. Suddenly, at the turn of a door, a hand grabs his arm and pulls him into a room. It was Reiju, who had managed to hide the Straw Hat in the infirmary. She informs him that Sanji is aware of Charlotte Pudding\u0027s deceptions and notes that Luffy\u0027s stomach is constantly rumbling. Reiju offers him something to eat, but Luffy refuses, remembering the promise he had made to his friend. Relieved, the young pirate leaps out of the window, much to Reiju\u0027s astonishment, to the place where he had promised Sanji he would stay...\n\nFor his part, Sanji remains in his dreams and ponders what Vinsmoke Jajji, Big Mom and finally Pudding told him when she held Reiju at her mercy. He concludes that there\u0027s no turning back now. Meanwhile, Luffy falls from the walls of Whole Cake Ch\u00e2teau and pierces the roof of a Sweet City resident\u0027s house. The resident steps out into the rain and sees the Straw Hat staggering along. Despite the presence of chess guards ready to catch him, Luffy is determined to return as quickly as possible to the place where he had rendezvoused with Sanji before his capture, at the risk of his own life...",

        "description": "Torn by a hunger that devours his insides, Luffy staggers through the damp streets of Sweet City. Two chess guards spot him and block his path to capture him. The Straw Hat doesn\u0027t give in and climbs to the top of a house to see where the rendezvous point was. Luffy sees the uprooted stump of King Baum and realizes that this is where he must go. However, the guards he had managed to shake off dislodged him from his perch, collapsing the house he had taken refuge in. At the end of his rope, the Straw Hat is at the mercy of Big Mom\u0027s two guards. He struggles to his feet, then lunges at the two armed men standing in front of him.\nMeanwhile, in Mirror World, Carrot worries about Chopper\u0027s condition after his reunion with Nami. The little reindeer reassures her friend that he\u0027s fine, while Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e notices Nami and Jinbei\u0027s presence and sees the latter\u0027s betrayal. Br\u00fbl\u00e9e was aware that Jinbei had intended to leave Big Mom\u0027s crew, but the sight of his roulette wheel had dissuaded him. The Fishman simply replied that he owed Big Mom a debt of gratitude for protecting Fishman Island on her behalf after the death of Whitebeard. He wanted to leave, but when he saw the wheel, he felt death and evil, and that\u0027s why he didn\u0027t turn it. For his part, Pedro congratulates Jinbei on not having done so, and reminds him that one of his closest friends had bitterly experienced this, losing his life after begging Big Mom for mercy. The Mink-Leopard concludes that this thing is made to kill whoever turns it. On hearing this, Carrot becomes incensed, realizing that the wheel was rigged. For her part, Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, still tied up, laughs at them, pointing out the obvious fact that her mother would never let anyone leave her crew alive, be it a second-rate pirate or a prominent pirate member. Big Mom\u0027s credo is that she welcomes those who join her and kills those who leave her. Chopper silences Br\u00fbl\u00e9e and then orders Diesel to find Brook, Luffy and Sanji. But he refuses, as he doesn\u0027t have enough strength to pull the cart. But Carrot changes his mind by giving him a hug. Diesel then sets off full steam ahead through the Mirror World.\n\nAt the same time, in Big Mom\u0027s room, she gloats over Brook\u0027s defeat by making him swing from left to right, suspended at the end of a rope. She sarcastically compliments him on having wounded - for the first time - her faithful Prometheus. Brook suddenly notices the presence of Charlotte Pudding. She asks his mother if she\u0027s going to carry on with this \u0022skeleton\u0022. Brook, unaware that Pudding has betrayed them, notes that calling him a skeleton isn\u0027t very nice of her. Big Mom explains to her daughter that before she puts him in a book, she plans to walk around with him in her hand.\n\nAfter this interlude, Big Mom congratulates Pudding on his good work with the Straw Hats, then tells him that she\u0027ll kill them after the ceremony, and as for the Vinsmoke, they\u0027ll be too busy drinking. Pudding tells her mother what she did to Reiju, who dared to spy on her, and Brook begins, with distressed astonishment, to understand that Pudding had betrayed them. The latter sees Big Mom recap the plan for the wedding: when Sanji has to give her the bride and groom\u0027s kiss and lifts her veil, all she has to do is shoot him with her pistol as her future husband sees his third eye for the first time. Carried away by a touch of madness, Big Mom starts laughing as she imagines the shot Pudding will take at Sanji: between the eyes, the bullet exploding his brain... She then tells us the rest of the plan: this will be the signal for all the Vinsmoke to be shot by people with guns, and a pool of blood will spread across the ground. Big Mom continues her insanity by saying that it will be a veritable deluge of bullets that will pierce their bodies, then exclaims that from that day on, all Germa will belong to her. When Brook learns of this plan, he is shocked.\n\nAt the same time, near Sanji\u0027s room, soldiers on duty think he\u0027s asleep in his bed and write him up in their report. In reality, the sleeper is a staff member who had accidentally dozed off in the groom\u0027s bed, and the soldiers had mistaken him for Sanji.\n\nNot far away, in the castle meeting room, Charlotte Mont d\u0027Or has summoned all Big Mom\u0027s subordinates, including Count Niwatori, who is recovering from his fight with Pedro, to take stock of the remaining members of the Straw Hats. Mont d\u0027Or, with the help of the wanted posters, takes stock. According to him, Brook has been defeated by Big Mom, Pedro has been blown up and Carrot and Chopper have been captured by Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e. As for Nami and Luffy, they are theoretically imprisoned in the prison-library... Mont d\u0027Or accusingly asks Charlotte Opera why there are rumors that Jinbei has released them from prison. Her brother retorts that this is not the case, and that he has simply done as he was told: tortured Nami to find out where Charlotte Laura is, and that he doesn\u0027t know where Jinbei has gone. In truth, Opera tells himself that he mustn\u0027t tell the truth or he\u0027d be severely reprimanded by Big Mom, taking away his years of life. Mont d\u0027Or then happily notes that there are no longer any intruders in the castle and triumphantly announces that his sister Pudding\u0027s wedding can go ahead. As his comrades leave the meeting room, Mont d\u0027Or orders the chess guards to continue their patrols and rounds, as he has no confidence in his brother Opera.\n\nIn a castle corridor, Sanji comes to terms with the fact that he\u0027s going to die because Big Mom\u0027s plan is going to work as planned, while Luffy fights desperately against the Empress\u0027s guards despite his great state of exhaustion. He soon finds himself surrounded on all sides. For his part, Sanji opens the lunch basket he had prepared for Pudding and notices that all the dishes he had made were the favorites of his fellow pirates. He decides to forget them, as his fate is sealed. As he laments, Bobbin appears and is astonished by Sanji\u0027s presence.\n\nOutside the castle, Luffy continues to fight like hell, using the full force of his Haki to combat his opponents. Having beaten them all, the Straw Hat decides to head for the rendezvous in the pouring rain, despite the hunger growling in his belly. For his part, Sanji continued to mope, oblivious to Bobiin\u0027s presence. Bobiin had opened the lunch basket and grabbed the piece of meat Sanji had prepared for Pudding. When he saw him, the pirate asked him if he wasn\u0027t supposed to sleep in his room. Sanji didn\u0027t answer his question, but when he saw the piece of meat Bobbin was holding in his hand, he remembered the promise Luffy had made him. The young prince snatched the piece of meat from Bobbin\u0027s hands and kicked it violently, alerting the guards posted nearby. Despite the danger, Sanji rushes off to where Luffy is supposed to be waiting, lunchbox in hand, wondering what he\u0027s really up to...",

        "description": "Having heard a ruckus in the corridor where Bobbin is, armed guards arrive to see what\u0027s going on, but Bobbin, recovering from his injuries, puts them to sleep with his strange hypnotic powers. He tells them he\u0027ll take care of fixing his mistakes and catch up with Sanji, who\u0027s running like hell to get to the rendezvous set by Luffy.\nAt the same time, Diesel leads Nami\u0027s group through Mirror World. Carrot continues to question the mirrors to find out where his friends are. One of them informs them that he has found Brook\u0027s trail. Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, who knows who the mirror belongs to, is delighted, much to Nami\u0027s astonishment. Soon the rescue group arrive at the spot where the mirror had called them and discover they\u0027ve arrived in front of Big Mom\u0027s room. They notice, to their dismay, that she was sleeping peacefully alongside her Homies, Prometheus, Zeus and Napoleon, and holding Brook firmly in her hand! The sight delighted Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, who couldn\u0027t help giggling. Suddenly, she started screaming, aided by Diesel, with the aim of waking Big Mom. Chopper and Carrot silence them by gagging. However, Big Mom wakes up to the presence of a fly, which Brook also notices. The Empress swats at the insect and destroys the floor with it. She immediately goes back to sleep with a voluble snore, as does Brook, who hadn\u0027t noticed her friends calling to her through the mirror. As for the three Homies, Prometheus, Zeus and Napoleon felt that Big Mom had been attacked and decided to neutralize the fly, using their powers at the same time. Brook\u0027s \u0022Mirror World\u0022 allies are frightened by this scene and wonder how they\u0027re going to save their friend.\n\nDespite the danger, Nami and her friends come up with a solution to save Brook. They make a mannequin resembling the living skeleton from a piece found in the execution room and seaweed (for the afro haircut) and plan to substitute it for the real thing by breaking into Big Mom\u0027s well-guarded room without her noticing. Jinbei places Br\u00fbl\u00e9e through the mirror so they can come and go as they please, and Brook\u0027s rescue mission can finally begin. Chopper is the first to jump in, regaining his normal height and hooking the dummy behind his back. Advancing cautiously towards Big Mom\u0027s bed, the little reindeer is on his guard, watching carefully as the Homies are fast asleep. But his paw stumbles over a stone and Chopper is about to be unmasked, much to the fear of his friends who are watching the whole scene from the other side of the mirror. But thanks to his skill, Chopper gets back on track to complete his mission. But as he reached the edge of the bed, he was caught sneezing, which he managed to hold back, much to everyone\u0027s relief. After overcoming this obstacle, Chopper is ready to do anything to save Brook, but he sneezes for good, attracting the wrath of Big Mom, who is still asleep. The little reindeer just about manages to find his friends.\n\nNow it\u0027s Carrot\u0027s turn to try her luck. With a leap, the Mink manages to land safely on Big Mom\u0027s bed without waking her up. But when she gets close to Brook, she realizes that she can\u0027t reach him because Big Mom\u0027s big snot bubble is in the way. She tries to avoid it, however, and manages to get above Brook to wake him up. Carrot doesn\u0027t succeed, however, as Big Mom\u0027s snot bubble knocks her off the bed. The Mink-Rabbit falls and wakes Prometheus! To prevent Brook\u0027s rescue mission from being a failure, Carrot pretends to be a stuffed rabbit, and this subterfuge pays off. The Homie sees nothing of it and goes back to sleep as if nothing had happened. Determined to save Brook, Carrot tries again, but as she steps forward, her foot hits a pebble that ricochets. These noises awaken Prometheus who, thinking he\u0027s dealing with the fly again, strikes Carrot with a bolt of lightning, sending her out of the room and back to her friends, covered in bruises.\n\nAfter another setback, it\u0027s Pedro\u0027s turn. He manages to climb onto the bed and ends up on top of Brook. He tries to wake him up, but to no avail, as he\u0027s fast asleep. Pedro is ready to make the switch and is already imagining how his plan will unfold, but he, like Carrot, is violently expelled from the bed by Big Mom, who had rolled over while he was asleep. Pedro returns to his comrades, ashamed of this latest failure. However, Big Mom has dropped Brook, who falls heavily to the floor without waking up. Nami takes over and makes the most of the opportunity.\n\nGrabbing the dummy, she enters Big Mom\u0027s room and tries to wake Brook up. The latter regains his senses before screaming when he sees the fake skeleton, which he takes for a ghost. The scream awakens Big Mom, who violently seizes Zeus and uses the \u0022Heavenly Fire\u0022 technique to flatten the fly she thought had returned. Seeing that the situation was turning sour, Jinbei jumps in to save Nami and Brook from certain death. They all end up safe and sound behind the mirror, while the fake Brook lies on the floor at the foot of Big Mom\u0027s bed, who has fallen back into the arms of Morpheus, along with her three favorite Homies.\n\nMeanwhile, Luffy had left town and was trying to reach the rendezvous despite the hunger in his gut. Just as he\u0027s about to do so, the Straw Hat is caught by Charlotte Counter, who gives him a scathing beating while reminding him that this was the place where he\u0027d managed to get her. For his part, Sanji runs to the rendezvous point but a hungry dog follows to bite his basket and eat the food inside. Sanji dissuades the dog before continuing on his way, while Luffy takes on Charlotte Counter in a fierce battle. Despite all his temerity, the Straw Hat can\u0027t get his opponent to bite the dust as he shamelessly stomps on him on the ground, even though Luffy was only a few steps away from the rendezvous...",

Exhausted, the Straw Hat is on the verge of surrendering, but a spark of life passes through his body. Luffy rises to his feet and attempts to attack his adversary. The latter looks at him naively, trying to stand on his legs as he was exhausted. Luffy tries to move towards where King Baum lies, but is prevented by Counter, who blocks his path and grabs him with his big hand. Luffy tries to defend himself and bites him to get out of the way. Unfortunately, his opponent hits him and inflicts a severe beating. Luffy can do nothing against him as his stomach continues to rumble. Now Counter\u0027s plaything, Luffy endures his relentless attacks without being able to fight back.\n\nWhile Luffy was being slaughtered, Sanji continued to run, unaware that Bobbin was following close behind, ready to do anything to avenge the affront he had inflicted on him earlier in the castle corridors. He set off in pursuit, unaware that a man with a gun was also chasing him.\n\nAt the same time, in Mirror World, Brook thanks his companions for saving him from Big Mom\u0027s clutches, despite the anger of Nami, who is still angry at her friend for shouting during his rescue. Despite the joy of the reunion, Pedro is disappointed that Big Mom\u0027s men have tightened security, making it impossible to recover a copy of the Road Poneglyph. He feels responsible for this failure, but Brook tries to cheer him up, telling him that they had a one-in-a-million chance of getting a copy. Besides, if they\u0027d tried to get the Road Poneglyph from Big Mom at any other time, an all-out war between pirates would have been inevitable. That\u0027s why they had to try, even if it was impossible. However, Brook suddenly opened his skull and, to everyone\u0027s astonishment, extracted a copy of the Road Pon\u00e9glyphe, which he immediately handed over to Nami in disbelief. The latter, realizing what she had in her hands, is stunned that her friend has succeeded in his mission just as he was about to be caught by Big Mom. Brook explains to his comrade that, at the time of his encounter with the Empress, he had finished copying a third paper just in time and managed to hide all the documents in his skull! Pedro is blown away by such a feat and reveals to his companions that the Poneglyph held by Big Mom is one of those things the other Yonk\u014d want to get their hands on. Unaware of the importance of his actions, Brook is warmly congratulated by his companions, while Diesel and Br\u00fbl\u00e9e are shocked to learn that their enemies are in possession of the contents of the Road Poneglyph. For his part, Chopper is pleased with the result, as they have managed to fulfill one of their objectives in reaching Tougato. Now all they have to do is get Sanji back.\n\nSanji had left town and was now running towards the rendezvous point, oblivious to the rain. As he ran, he remembered Luffy\u0027s last words to him, that he wouldn\u0027t move an inch from here, and that he wouldn\u0027t eat anything but his food. As Sanji made his way to his appointed spot, he saw a huge puff of smoke in front of him. This is the site of Luffy\u0027s confrontation with Counter. The latter thinks he\u0027s eliminated him, but is dismayed to see the Straw Hat staggering towards him. For his part, Sanji quickened his pace as he approached the rendezvous.\n\nAs Sanji ran like a maniac, Luffy advanced and saw Charlotte Counter\u0027s menacing shadow looming over him. The latter delivers the coup de grace with a Haki-covered punch. Luffy is stunned, but immediately counters with a punch to the face. Sanji arrives on the battlefield to see hundreds of dead. He freezes in terror.\n\nMeanwhile, in Mirror World, Carrot continues his research into Luffy and Sanji and asks the mirrors about them. They reply that they hadn\u0027t seen them pass. Nami then deduces that they must be in a place without mirrors and concludes that they are in the place where they fought this morning. The young sailor then confesses to her friends that Luffy and Sanji have been fighting. This news saddens Chopper, who can\u0027t believe what he\u0027s been waiting for. But it\u0027s true. For his part, Jinbei informs them that the wedding ceremony must not take place as it is a special one. He also adds that Pekoms almost died because he was the victim of a plot orchestrated by Capone Bege.\n\nOutside town, Bobbin, who was chasing Sanji, is shot at point-blank range by a man in black, while inside their guest room at the Whole Cake Ch\u00e2teau, the men of the Vinsmoke Family are getting drunk on barrels of liquor brought in by female bartenders who had served them and are drunk and slumped on the floor. They celebrate the upcoming formalization of their alliance with Big Mom\u0027s pirates. Yonji confesses that he would have preferred Nami to have brought them drinks, and Niji praises her, adding that he would like to \u0022own her\u0022. However, their father suggests they stop drinking and save themselves for the next day, which will be a day of joy, as it will see the triumph of Germa 66 and the beginning of the reconquest of North Blue. Admittedly, this victory is largely due to Sanji, whom Jajji continues to call a failure. So they toast to the health of \u0022failure\u0022, unaware that outside their room, the Empress\u0027s soldiers are keeping an eye on them to make sure they don\u0027t contact anyone. Charlotte Mont d\u0027Or, who coordinates the whole operation, is pleased with the result. For his part, Bobbin, seriously wounded, struggles to keep moving and collapses on the floor, covered in blood.\n\nNight has set in and Jajji has succumbed to the arms of Morpheus, while Reiju is plagued by a thousand questions. For her part, the Empress is still asleep in her room with Brook\u0027s dummy, unaware that she has been fooled. Meanwhile, in the pouring rain and the middle of a thunderstorm, Sanji advances to the middle of the battlefield where Big Mom\u0027s enraged army and his friends had clashed, and sees the dead on all sides. Believing the worst, he begins to search for Luffy among the corpses, and after long, anxious minutes, he hears strange gurgling noises in the distance. Sanji then smiles as he finds his captain sleeping at the foot of King Baum, still lying on the ground...",

        "description": "After a fierce battle that left him bloodless, Luffy finally defeated the terrifying Charlotte Counter. Using the last of his strength, the Straw Hat marched through the pouring rain to the uprooted stump of King Baum to wait for Sanji. Avoiding sleep, Luffy had to keep his eyes open or he wouldn\u0027t even know if his friend had come to find him. But tiredness takes its toll and he loses consciousness as Sanji desperately searches for him across the battlefield. It was when he heard his gurgling that he found him, tired and wrinkled to the point of deformity, leaning against the collapsed King Baum. A smile of relief suddenly lit up Sanji\u0027s face as he realized that his friend was still alive.\nSanji advanced towards Luffy, who soon woke up to the smell of his friend\u0027s bent\u014d. The latter still remembered their last stormy encounter and coldly handed him his meal, pointing out that the food had been mixed and soiled by the rain. The Straw Hat doesn\u0027t care, swallowing them one by one and quickly invigorating himself by saying that it\u0027s succulent. This doesn\u0027t flatter Sanji, who doesn\u0027t believe him and calls him a liar. When the meal is over, Sanji asks him to leave. But Luffy refuses and asks him to leave with him. This is out of the question for Sanji, who gives him three reasons why he should decline his offer. Firstly, he hit his captain, so he feels he\u0027s no longer worthy to return to the Sunny. Secondly, the crew of the Baratie are being held hostage by his father, and thirdly, his family, whom he detests to the utmost, are also in grave danger tomorrow at the wedding ceremony he is obliged to attend.\n\nAfter explaining the three reasons for his refusal, Sanji asks his friend to leave. But Luffy tries to bring him to his senses with a violent punch that sends Sanji crashing into the trunk of King Baum! Luffy then approaches him and forces him to confess that he really wants to return to his crew. Sanji is violently overcome by shame and sadness at having to abandon his friends, and remembers the times he had spent in their company.\n\nCrying with every fiber of his being, Sanji finally breaks down and begs Luffy to return to the Thousand Sunny. He confesses that he doesn\u0027t have the courage to flee in the face of the threats to Baratie\u0027s men and his family. He also knows there\u0027s nothing he can do to stop the wedding ceremony, but in his heart he wants to save his father and brothers, even if they don\u0027t deserve the right to live. The Straw Hat, convinced by his friend\u0027s words, smiles and restores Sanji\u0027s confidence, as he dries his tears. Luffy offers his help and, with a toothless grin, tells him that he\u0027s ready to ruin the marriage as the sun rises on Tougato Island.\n\nMeanwhile, a mysterious and terrifying man appears and steps in front of the high doors of Whole Cake Ch\u00e2teau to ask for an audience with Big Mom, with only five hours and thirty minutes left before the Tea Party begins...",

        "description": "Sheltered in the rain at the foot of King Baum, Luffy and Sanji chat. Sanji hears from his friend that Jinbei has reappeared. Luffy tells him that the main problem at the moment is to rejoin the rest of the group and tell them that Sanji has returned. However, Sanji is remorseful towards Nami for having hurt her by announcing his departure. But the Straw Hat reassures him that Nami and the others care more about Sanji than their captain. Soon the rain stops and the sun breaks through the clouds, much to Sanji\u0027s astonishment.\nAt the same time, in the Mirror World, Nami and her companions try to reach Luffy via a mirror that had shattered when the young sailor was at the top of King Baum before her stormy meeting with Sanji. Thanks to this fragment, Chopper manages to contact Luffy, who finds on the floor the piece of mirror from which his friend\u0027s voice emanates. Sanji is astonished, as he doesn\u0027t understand how a little reindeer\u0027s voice can come out of a mirror. Nami turns to Luffy and asks if Sanji is with him. He replies that he is, and all Nami\u0027s companions rejoice at this good news. Meanwhile, Carrot informs the Straw Hat that they have managed to save everyone in Mirror World, including Brook and Pedro, while Chopper tells them that the living skeleton has managed to make a copy of the Road Poneglyph. However, Pedro intervenes and asks Luffy if he has found common ground with Sanji. But the Straw Hat reveals that his friend can\u0027t come back to them yet. All his companions are shocked, but Luffy manages to cheer them up by announcing his intention to cancel the wedding and save the lives of the Vinsmoke Family. This project frightens all his friends, including Sanji, who fears for Nami\u0027s life. Indeed, it would be suicidal to attack a Yonk\u014d head-on! Suddenly, Chopper, Carrot and Brook start crying when they hear Sanji\u0027s voice, saying they\u0027re worried sick. As for Nami, she tells Sanji that she won\u0027t forgive him for scaring her like that, but that she\u0027ll let it go this time because they had so little time before the Tea Party started. Sanji is moved. Jinbei then speaks up and tells Luffy that this means, even if they don\u0027t go after Big Mom directly, they\u0027ll have to deal with all his subordinates, including the shadowy leaders from all over the world who\u0027ve been invited to the Tea Party. What\u0027s more, he reminds her that there are only eight of them. However, the Sea Paladin has a plan and asks the Straw Hat if he knows Capone Bege. This question takes Luffy by surprise.\n\nAt the same time, Charlotte Daifuku, the third son of the Charlotte Family, member of Big Mom\u0027s Crew and Minister of Beans, arrives at the castle and requests an audience with his mother to take part in the Tea Party starting in five hours\u0027 time. Without asking the guards to announce him, he opens the gates himself, using the powers of his Demon Fruit to conjure up a genie. Meanwhile, in the Mirror World, Jinbei mentions the name Capone \u0022Gang\u0022 Bege to Luffy and informs him that he is one of the bosses of the five big mafias that control the West Blue underworld, and that he is feared in this milieu. His nickname \u0022Gang\u0022 dates back to his youth, when he made a name for himself as a hitman. According to Jinbei, Bege is a sick man who enjoys hurting defenseless living beings and watching them weaken again and again. Thus, by posing as a simple waiter, he managed to take out many mafia bosses without them being able to stop him.\n\nOver the years, Capone Bege made his place in the sun and climbed the underworld ladder one by one to become one of the mob\u0027s most powerful leaders. However, that wasn\u0027t enough for him and he decided to team up with a Yonk\u014d to secure his future. Moreover, Big Mom had every confidence in Bege, to whom she had entrusted the security of the Tea Party. With this backing, Bege has free rein to fulfill all his dreams of power. Jinbei reveals to Luffy and Sanji that Supernova intends to kill Big Mom at the Tea Party to upset the balance of power. This news shocks his listeners, who don\u0027t believe in such a thing. What\u0027s more, Fishman confesses to his friends that Bege had framed Pekoms for being too loyal to Big Mom. He shot him and threw his body to the sharks. But Jinbei\u0027s men came along and rescued the Mink, who is now resting in their camp. The Straw Hat is relieved to hear this, but very angry with Bege for hurting his friend. However, despite these revelations, Jinbei, in a serious tone, tells Luffy that the Firetank\u0027s crew chief has already prepared his plan to eliminate Big Mom, and that the only way to save Sanji\u0027s family is to form an alliance with him. Luffy and Sanji can\u0027t believe their ears, but they have no other choice: they end up accepting Jinbei\u0027s proposal and reluctantly decide to meet him a few hours later before the Tea Party begins...",

        "description": "Taking his time to think things over, Luffy accepts Jinbei\u0027s proposal and decides to ally himself with Capone Bege in order to ruin the Tea Party, despite the refusal of his companions, who know of the thug\u0027s dark past. However, the Straw Hat\u0027s decision is irrevocable. Jinbei takes the opportunity to tell Luffy the location of Bege\u0027s hideout. It lies to the north-west of the island. In the meantime, Nami\u0027s team will join Capone Bege\u0027s through Mirror World and await the arrival of their friends.\nMeanwhile, in the Firetank Crew\u0027s lair, Capone Bege questions Vito about whether he killed Bobbin, who was following Sanji too closely. His right-hand man, a big fan of Germa 66, tells him he has. After this interlude, Gotty asks his captain if it\u0027s true that there will be an interview with the Straw Hat Crew. Bege confirms this and tells him he\u0027s ready to kill the Straw Hat if it starts to annoy him.\n\nNot far away, on the eighth floor of the Whole Cake Ch\u00e2teau, Streusen, the head chef of Big Mom\u0027s Crew, finalizes the preparation of the wedding cake, giving instructions to his cooks. At the same time, on the island\u0027s eastern cove, Pekoms has been rescued by Charlotte Praline and her husband Aladin, members of the Sun Pirates Crew, and they make sure he\u0027s resting well. But he isn\u0027t. The Mink is worried about Jinbei, who he feels must report Bege\u0027s ambitions to Big Mom. Although the ship\u0027s doctor forbids him to move, Pekoms finds another reason for wanting to leave, as he had spotted some Fish-Men carrying goods last night. Aladdin is frightened to think that the Mink has found out what Jinbei is up to by collaborating with Capone Bege to get rid of Big Mom.\n\nAt 4.15 a.m. before the start of the Tea Party, Sanji and Luffy arrive running at the Pirates\u0027 Fire Tank HQ. They are greeted by Vito, who tells them in his own way that their friends are already there. Indeed, Chopper appears, sans his ever-present hat, and advises them to take a bath. Vito also forces them to take one if they want to meet Capone Bege. Capone Bege doesn\u0027t like dirty people. Not far away, in the women\u0027s bathroom, Nami and Carrot relax in a large hot bath and meet Charlotte Chiffon. The young sailor tells them about her adventures in Thriller Bark and her friendship with Charlotte Laura, who had been turned into a zombie warthog. Chiffon tells them that Big Mom is hated by all the giants in the world, which is why there are no giants among Totland\u0027s diverse population. She begins to tell them a strange tale, that of Loki, the prince of the kingdom of Elbaf, who fell in love at first sight with Charlotte Laura. Big Mom became so happy that she wept with joy. She thought that if Laura became Princess of Elbaf, her old feud with the giants would be a thing of the past, and she could even use their army, which is known to be the strongest in the world. Unfortunately, Big Mom\u0027s ambitions were dashed when Laura ran away. Her mother then ordered Chiffon to replace her sister, but the marriage arrangements fell through because Loki sincerely loved Laura. After this incident, Big Mom\u0027s relationship with the giants worsened still further, and she decided to abandon the idea of becoming their friend. She began to invest, through Caesar Clown, in research into turning people into giants. As for Laura, her mother hates her deeply and she is considered a criminal in Totland. If she ever returned, Laura would be killed! After her failed alliance with the giants, Big Mom began to treat Chiffon harshly because of her strong resemblance to her twin sister. Out of spite, Chiffon was now ready to conspire with her husband to murder her mother.\n\nFor their part, Brook and Luffy are also relaxing in their bath and, without asking permission from Bege\u0027s men, help themselves to some milk from their fridge to re-energize themselves. At the same time, Vito arrives to see if the two pirates are clean. When they answer in the affirmative, he invites them to change their clothes. This was already done by Nami and Carrot, who each received an outfit from Charlotte Chiffon\u0027s personal wardrobe. For his part, Sanji leaves his apartments and meets Nami in the corridor. The latter, cold, doesn\u0027t look at him in the slightest. However, the young woman stops and gives him one last chance to redeem himself after completing their mission. Sanji is overjoyed that she has agreed to forgive him and will do anything to please the beautiful sailor. Meanwhile, Diesel and Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, who had unwillingly accompanied the Chapeaux de Paille, tried to dissuade Chiffon from murdering his mother, but his mind was made up: Big Mom was going to die!\n\nAt three hours and thirty minutes before the wedding, the entire Straw Hat Crew, accompanied by Carrot, Jinbei and Pedro, meet the Firetank Crew. Among the pirates assembled in the large meeting room, Luffy doesn\u0027t recognize Caesar Clown, disguised as \u0022Gangster Gastino\u0022, who had been recruited by Bege. He then appears and, after noticing the new outfits of his \u0022allies\u0022, decides to join forces to take down Big Mom. At the same time, Charlotte Oven, baking chancellor and fourth son of the Charlotte family, arrives at the castle to meet his mother. He makes a sensational entrance, piercing the castle gates with his heat alone! There\u0027s still 3 1\/2 hours to go before the Tea Party begins...",

        "description": "With three hours and twenty minutes to go before the start of the Tea Party, the atmosphere is tense in Capone Bege\u0027s lair, where the Firetank crew faces off against the Straw Hat crew. Luffy\u0027s every move is scrutinized, as are those of his acolytes. The mafia boss decides to kill them all; but Sanji points out that if he wasn\u0027t back at the castle two hours before the wedding was due to start, Big Mom would be suspicious and his assassination attempt would fall through. Convinced by his arguments, Bege offers to spare him, but in exchange he\u0027ll kill all his friends. The latter, shocked to hear this, tell him not to underestimate them, while Jinbei asks Luffy if he still wants to ally himself with these dangerous pirates. The Straw Hat observes them for a long time, and suddenly his gaze lingers on one of them who doesn\u0027t seem so foreign to him. It\u0027s Caesar Clown! He\u0027s intimidated to be discovered in this way, having just a few hours before been working for Big Mom in a brand-new laboratory designing a drug capable of turning people into giants. However, the scientist had no intention of doing anything and was resting quietly. Suddenly, his tranquility was disrupted by the arrival of Capone Bege and his gang. The pirate, who was officially in charge of his surveillance, offered Caesar the chance to work for him. At first reluctant, the former master of Punk Hazard finally accepts his proposal when he sees his heart being manipulated by the gangster. Under Vito\u0027s watchful eye, C\u00e9sar began building the KX spear when his \u0022jailer\u0022 told him of the imminent arrival of the Straw Hats. For fear of being found out, Caesar changed his appearance to become a blood brother of Capone Bege under the name Gangster Gaztino. But his laughter and way of speaking unmasked him. Luffy lashes out at him and they start bickering. The scientist, beside himself, promises the Straw Hat to kill him and Trafalgar Law at the first opportunity, should he see him again. All this bickering begins to weigh heavily on Bege, who presses Clown\u0027s heart to silence him. Clown, writhing in pain, is put back in his place.\nAfter this short interlude, Capone Bege points out to his hosts that the clock is ticking. He asks Luffy if he still agrees to join forces with him. The Straw Hat accepts, but only on condition that he can beat him up for trying to kill Pekoms. As Luffy prepares to throw a punch at Bege, he is stopped by Jinbei, who orders him to pull himself together if he doesn\u0027t want the partnership to fail. But the Straw Hat doesn\u0027t give a damn and hits Bege, who protects himself by using Caesar Clown\u0027s heart as a shield. Exasperated by such attitudes, Jinbei tries to calm things down by reminding Caesar, Bege and Luffy that they all have the same goal: to take down Big Mom. Having carried out this operation together, they can settle their accounts later. Tentatively reconciled, Luffy and Caesar Clown try to put their grudges behind them and listen to Capone Bege\u0027s concocted plan.\n\nMeanwhile, the ships of the Tea Party guests all arrive at Whole Cake Island harbor. These are the leaders of the organized crime world, and every soldier on the island takes fright at the sight of them. Not far away, in the secret lair of the Firetank Crew, Sanji informs Capone Bege that he has no interest in seeing Big Mom die, as she is impervious to bullets and cannonballs. This news frightens his companions, but not Bege, who knows how to get rid of the Empress. Before he can divulge his plan, Caesar Clown intervenes and reminds him of the deal they made with each other: he helps Bege assassinate Big Mom in exchange for her heart and her freedom. If the mobster doesn\u0027t honor the deal, he\u0027ll kill his son. For her part, Charlotte Chiffon, who still holds Capone Pez in her arms, reminds him that her husband is a man of honor and will keep his promise, while calling him \u0022Gas-hiko\u0022, which infuriates the scientist. For her part, Nami doesn\u0027t take Caesar Clown seriously, even though he plays a vital role in the operation. He\u0027s the creator of the deadly KX poison rocket launcher capable of killing Big Mom. He\u0027s designed three of them just in case, even though one is enough to carry out the operation. This revolutionary weapon can inject five grams of lethal organophosphate directly into a subject\u0027s body, causing instant death. What\u0027s more, the gas would kill an ordinary person just by touching their skin. In Big Mom\u0027s case, however, the venture was doomed to failure, as her skin was impervious to bullets. This was Brook\u0027s bitter experience when he tried to pierce the Empress with his sword. However, Capone Bege has a solution to ensure that his plan goes off without a hitch. To do so, he has to meet two conditions. The first: he needs a situation in which no one can attack him for five seconds. And the second: he needs Big Mom to be weakened. That\u0027s why the mobster chose to carry out his plan during the Tea Party, because that\u0027s when both conditions will be met.\n\nBege reminds his \u0022guests\u0022 that Big Mom is invulnerable to bullets and bombs. She\u0027s like an iron bullet. Yet the mobster remembers seeing Big Mom get a scratch once. Upon hearing this information, Vivo calls out to his boss, reminding him of the Mother Caramel photo incident, to the dismay of Bege. The latter reveals that at every Tea Party, there\u0027s always a picture frame of Caramel on the table in the chair opposite Big Mom, and no one sits in it. For all Bege knows, this photo is the Empress\u0027s most prized treasure. It\u0027s Big Mom\u0027s only weak spot, and it\u0027s thanks to it that he\u0027ll be able to carry out his plan, even if he himself doesn\u0027t know what connections Big Mom has with this mysterious person. Even members of his own family don\u0027t know who Mother Caramel really is, including Charlotte Chiffon. She tells Les Chapeaux de Paille a very interesting anecdote. At a Tea Party, a waiter accidentally knocked Mother Caramel\u0027s portrait off the table. Big Mom\u0027s demeanor changed abruptly: she turned pale and let out a piercing scream that froze the blood of her guests. The latter could only plug their ears to protect their eardrums, but they ended up fainting one by one. For her part, Capone Bege explains this phenomenon by explaining to the Straw Hats that at the height of her scream, she used the Royal Fluid all because someone had pushed a simple photo. The mobster also remembers that after this incident Big Mom had ended up on her knees in shock and scraped her knee. She was bleeding. Bege was surprised to see that her blood was as red as his own! He then realized that if anyone dared touch her photo, Big Mom would collapse and her body would become fragile. That\u0027s why Capone Bege chose the Tea Party to carry out his plan, and asked his \u0022associates\u0022 what would happen if the frame broke in two: Big Mom would be devastated, and no one present would be able to move for more than five seconds! That\u0027s when Capone Bege uses the KX rocket launcher to get rid of Big Mom for good. The news of the Empress\u0027s assassination would spread around the world like wildfire.\n\nHowever, Chopper has his doubts about the effectiveness of this operation, as Capone and his men will also fall victim to Big Mom\u0027s shrill cry. The mobster has thought of everything and shows the little reindeer the earplugs that are supposed to protect them during the Empress\u0027 crisis. The only problem is the maneuvering speed. They won\u0027t have much time to put everything into action, as they\u0027ll have to face Big Mom\u0027s men, who are furious that traitors are attacking their mistress. That\u0027s why Luffy\u0027s role is crucial to the assassination plan: he\u0027ll act as bait to distract the Empress\u0027s subordinates. This idea alarms the members of the Straw Hat Crew, but not their captain, who accepts this daring plan without a second thought. There are still three hours to go before the Tea Party begins...",

        "description": "Luffy has accepted Capone Bege\u0027s proposal, much to the dismay of his friends, who try in vain to reason with him. But the Straw Hat\u0027s mind is made up: he\u0027s going to play bait while the mobster takes care of Big Mom\u0027s assassination. Luffy already knows how he\u0027s going to do it, imagining an entrance that he won\u0027t divulge to his companions. For his part, Bege observes the scene and asks Luffy how he\u0027s going to break the frame of Mother Caramel\u0027s portrait. The young pirate replied that he would do it the moment Sanji kissed Charlotte Pudding. His friend stops him in his tracks, telling him he\u0027d never kiss Big Mom\u0027s daughter, while Brook reminds everyone that this kiss will attract the attention of all the Tea Party guests, and that\u0027s when Pudding will shoot Sanji at point-blank range! Sanji reassures them that he will dodge the shot. However, this shot will be the signal for the start of the operation.\nAccording to Bege, just as Pudding shoots Sanji, Luffy takes the opportunity to break Mother Caramel\u0027s picture frame, plunging Big Mom into a deep lethargy that will shatter the eardrums of her guests. However, Capone Bege and his men had planned ahead, as they were equipped with earplugs to avoid hearing the Empress\u0027s shrill cry. During the panic, Luffy and his friends will save the members of Germa 66, while the Fire Tank Pirates will use their KX rocket launchers to fire the deadly poison at Big Mom. They have to do all this in ten seconds maximum. This detail frightens Nami, who wants to know why. Bege tells her that the longer they wait, the greater their chances of dying. However, the whole operation rests on the shoulders of the Straw Hat, who will break the frame. Indeed, once he\u0027s done that, three seconds pass before Big Mom screams. It\u0027s during this time that Luffy will have to stop the Chancellors if the chances of assassinating Big Mom are to succeed.\n\nAfter Big Mom is killed, Bege explains to his \u0022allies\u0022 that Caesar Clown will appear with a mirror that will allow them to escape through Mirror World thanks to the power of Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, then each group will take their respective ship and the alliance will be broken. The deal is struck, two and a half hours before the event. Sanji, meanwhile, watches the clock and tells everyone that he must return to the castle to prepare for his \u0022wedding\u0022.\n\nMeanwhile, Charlotte Mont d\u0027Or and her men discover Bobbin\u0027s lifeless body. Big Mom\u0027s 19th son, drunk with anger, wants to know who killed him. The soldiers on duty assure him that they will do everything in their power to find the culprit. Suddenly, a guard arrives and tells Mont d\u0027Or that he has seen Sanji running out of the suburbs. This news is not to the liking of his boss, who believes that either Sanji or Luffy is responsible for Bobbin\u0027s death, and announces, in an implacable tone, that the wedding has no reason to take place.\n\nAt the same time, Sanji runs back to Big Mom\u0027s castle, unaware that Charlotte Mont d\u0027Or is looking for him. The latter is in front of the groom\u0027s room and asks a guard if Sanji is inside. When the soldier replies in the affirmative, he decides to see for himself and orders Sanji to open the door. The guard, who had been sleeping in his bed, wakes up and becomes frightened. He searches desperately for Sanji, but can\u0027t find him. Losing patience, Mont d\u0027Or opens the door and comes face to face with Sanji! Sanji complains about the noise, but Mont d\u0027Or doesn\u0027t mind and wants to know if Sanji has been in his room all night. To prove the truth, he orders the guard assigned to watch over the prince of the Kingdom of Germa to come and confirm his claims. The guard, on the verge of fainting, tells his chief that everything Sanji said was true. The latter asks Mont d\u0027Or to leave, but Mont d\u0027Or stays behind to tell him coldly that Luffy is dead. This news doesn\u0027t even faze Sanji, and his attitude confirms Charlotte Mont d\u0027Or\u0027s intuition: the Straw Hat is still alive and plotting something!\n\nTired of these interrogations, Sanji orders Mont d\u0027Or to be left in peace to prepare for his forthcoming wedding. The latter obeys, while Sanji\u0027s guard recovers from his past fear. He remembers how the groom-to-be burst into his room just as Mont d\u0027Or was about to enter. He asks Sanji what he did that night, and Sanji answers in the simplest terms possible that he went to deliver a packed lunch to Pudding himself. The guard believes him and stops questioning him.\n\nAt the same time, on Fromageville, on the Isle of Milk, as well as in Cacahu\u00e8teville, on the Isle of Walnuts, and in Chocoville, on the Isle of Cocoa, all the inhabitants are delighted at the news of the wedding and eagerly await it. As for the Vinsmoke, they\u0027re all getting ready, with the exception of Reiju, whose absence worries Jajji. Nevertheless, Ichiji tells her father that she is finishing her preparations in another room. Meanwhile, on the ninth floor of the Whole Cake Ch\u00e2teau, Big Mom wakes up and cries after discovering Brook\u0027s lifeless body, which was in fact a mannequin. Her mood changes, however, when Zeus and Prometheus remind her that today is Tea Party day. Big Mom smiles as she thinks of the wedding cake she\u0027s about to enjoy.\n\nMeanwhile, in the eastern cove, Aladdin and his Fishmen prepare to set sail for their island, leaving Pekoms alone with some food. The latter, still tied up, is horrified to learn from Aladdin that Jinbei intends to betray Big Mom. This was the decision of the Captain of the Sun Pirate Crew, who had called all his men together to announce his decision. The whale-shark man had ordered them to flee, because by allying himself with the Straw Hats, he would be entering into a rebellion against Big Mom. Jinbei had previously tried to do this, but gave up after being subjected to Big Mom\u0027s roulette wheel, the numbers on which represent the number of friends who will be executed with him. To avoid this, Jinbei asks Aladdin and his men to flee as quickly as possible. Their escape can take place at the start of the Tea Party, when the Hors-d\u0027oeuvre ships, the interceptors of the various islands, will be escorting the guests and security will be less tight. Jinbei tells Aladdin that he is willing to risk his life to save Luffy, while his loyal lieutenant informs him that he will sail to Fish Island to protect it from any reprisals by Big Mom. This attitude honors Jinbei, who promises to return to Ryugu Kingdom alive after this perilous mission.\n\nIn the present, Aladdin and his men prepare to leave, abandoning Pekoms to his fate, while the entire Vinsmoke family learns that the Tea Party will take place on the roof for the first time. Yonji asks her sister Reiju where she\u0027s been, to which she replies that it\u0027s none of her business. In her thoughts, she wonders what Sanji is up to and worries about him. At the same time, in her beautiful wedding dress, Pudding is depressed at the thought of having to murder Sanji and alter the memories of those to whom she wants to continue appearing innocent.\n\nAt 9.05 a.m., Big Mom is about to attend the Tea Party, where she will destroy all the members of Germa 66, including Sanji, while Capone Bege is ready to do anything to assassinate the Empress with the help of his gang. In the midst of this tumult, Sanji is thinking of saving his family, while Luffy seems to be the key to this infernal spiral...",

        "description": "On his way to the tea party, dressed in his groom\u0027s habit, Sanji remembers Charlotte Pudding\u0027s despicable words that he had overheard in secret. She was planning to murder the entire Vinsmoke family during the wedding ceremony. Arriving in a large hall, he was stunned to see his bride in her wedding dress. At the same time, outside on the roof of the Whole Cake Ch\u00e2teau, the various wedding guests are meticulously searched by security guards. Just then, the members of the Vinsmoke Family arrive, eager to enter into a marital alliance with Big Mom in the hope of one day reclaiming East Blue. However, when they arrive at the gate, they stop at the sight of Capone Bege\u0027s men guarding the entrance. Capone Bege calls out to Vinsmoke Niji, informing him that he and his family are to be searched on Big Mom\u0027s orders. Reluctant at first, they acquiesce, obediently handing over the weapons they were carrying, but in the face of Bege\u0027s growing zeal, the Vinsmoke show signs of aggression that are not to the mob boss\u0027s liking. His men turn their guns on Sanji\u0027s family, and everyone is on the brink of a confrontation. Faced with this inextricable situation, Vinsmoke Judge orders his sons to calm down before it\u0027s too late. They obeyed, brooding over their anger. For his part, Capone Bege welcomes them to Big Mom\u0027s tea party.\nMeanwhile, Luffy and his friends consult the table plan for the ceremony and know exactly where the Empress will be placed. They\u0027re all concentrating on the operation, except for Straw Hat, who\u0027s having fun with a butterfly net! Chopper doesn\u0027t understand what\u0027s happening to his captain, who starts running around. At the same time, the Homies announce to all the guests the start of the Tea Party and the arrival of Big Mom as Mistress of Ceremonies. Big Mom is thrilled to be part of the festivities, as she gets to enjoy the most exquisite cakes and sweets. Meanwhile, the first guests arrive. First, the king of the underworld, God of Fortune Du Feld, then come the lovely Stussy, Queen of the Pleasure Quarter, Drug Peclo the mortician, Big News Morgans, president of the International Economic Times, Giberson, the giant of the storage industry, and finally Umit, the king of shipping. On their way to the Tea Party, these six distinguished guests don\u0027t stop bickering. They are soon greeted by Charlotte Perospero, who welcomes them and, thanks to her Demon Fruit, creates a special candy staircase so they can quickly make their way to the venue. As the six underworld leaders climb the staircase using an escalator, Perospero takes the opportunity to hand out lollipops to the children who have flocked to the ceremony, promising to lick his fantastic candy staircase afterwards.\n\nThe Tea Party is in full swing and all the guests take their seats. They are amazed by the abundance of food gathered there, as are the six underworld leaders who make their entrance. Charlotte Smoothie catches sight of them, welcomes them back and invites them in for drinks. She offers them incredible cocktails such as giraffe juice, which they enjoy with relish. Meanwhile, at the foot of the castle, Jigra, another major underworld figure, makes a scene. He refuses to be searched by Bege and, in a fit of rage, reveals that he was invited to the last Tea Party but couldn\u0027t attend, as he had to attend his mother\u0027s funeral. Upset by this refusal and the letter of apology sent by Jigra, Big Mom sent him the severed head of the Underworld organ trafficker\u0027s father. No sooner had he said these words than Jigra was gunned down without warning by Charlotte Katakuri, one of Big Mom\u0027s sons, without Capone\u0027s men being able to do a thing! Katakuri, gifted with an Observation Haki so developed that he can guess the future in advance, had predicted to Bege what would have happened if Jifra hadn\u0027t been killed: he came for revenge and would have murdered Big Mom! He would have killed two of Bege\u0027s men just to attend the Tea Party, knowing that he wouldn\u0027t come back alive from his vendetta. Faced with such a prodigious feat, Capone Bege takes fright and realizes that Katakuri could be a great obstacle to the execution of his plan.\n\nSuddenly, an explosion occurs and 100 of the organ trafficker\u0027s assassins arrive to avenge Jigra\u0027s death. Capone Bege\u0027s men try to shoot them with their rifles, but to no avail. They seem invulnerable to bullets and eventually gain the upper hand. However, Katakuri has the last word, assisted by his brothers Charlotte Oven and Charlotte Daifuku. The former neutralizes a large number of the attackers thanks to the powers of his Demon Fruit. The survivors flee to avoid the same fate, but are caught by Daifuku, who exterminates every last one of them using the power of Hoya Hoya no Mi, the Fruit of the Lamp-Man.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Seductive Woods, Luffy hunts animals with his butterfly net and manages to catch a nice catch. At the same moment, at 10:00 sharp, escorted by her faithful Zeus and Prometheus, Big Mom enters the Tea Party and tells all her guests to enjoy the ceremony to the full, eating and drinking as much as they like of all the food served. Sanji takes this as a warning and keeps quiet, waiting for what\u0027s to come...",

        "description": "As the children of Tougato Island revel in Perospero\u0027s melting candy staircase, guards posted outside the bride and groom\u0027s waiting room on the ninth floor of the Whole Cake Ch\u00e2teau announce via snail phone that the Tea Party has just begun and that the bride and groom have finished getting ready, and that the wedding ceremony will start at 12:00 sharp. Inside, a steward reminds Sanji what he must do during the ceremony: lift Charlotte Pudding\u0027s veil and kiss her. Luffy\u0027s friend is confused as he stands next to his young bride, resplendent in her magnificent wedding gown.\nAt the same time, on the roof of the castle, with the party in full swing, Luffy emerges from the body of Capone Bege where he had been hiding. He insists on going to the Tea Party, but the leader of the Fire Tank Pirates stops him for fear of ruining his plan. Faced with the Straw Hat\u0027s insistence, Nami has to do things the hard way and hits the Straw Hat to calm him down. For his part, Vito spies on what\u0027s going on at the party. He reports to Bege that Morgans is talking to Vinsmoke Jajji and considers it incredible. He adds that he has spotted many of Big Mom\u0027s important children, such as Perospero, the eldest son, Charlotte Compote, the eldest daughter, Daifuku and Oven (the third and fourth sons respectively) and, of course, Smoothie and Katakuri. He finds it problematic that these people are their enemies.\n\nMeanwhile, Big Mom, seated at her table, sees a guard obediently bring her a photograph of Mother Caramel, a smiling old woman holding a cigarette. The Queen becomes playful and describes Mother Caramel as \u0022the light that illuminates this world\u0022. The man who brought her the photograph, who is attending the Tea Party for the first time, apprehensively asks who Mother Caramel is. At this point, Big Mom suddenly loses her temper, shouting at him not to \u0022offend her memory\u0022, while at the same time unleashing her Haki of Kings, causing the poor unfortunate to faint.\n\nNot far away, in the castle kitchens, the cooks, who have finished all the dishes for the Tea Party, are holding a banquet. Bege\u0027s subordinates, disguised as cooks, have just come up the stairs to inform their boss that all the exits are now locked, thanks to them, so that the room is totally isolated for the proper execution of the plan, after having placed horned snails in every nook and cranny of the castle to jam radio signals. But two of his men are bothered by a drunken cook who thinks he\u0027s dealing with intruders. He is silenced by Gotti and Vito, who have gone downstairs to see if the infiltration operation is working properly.\n\nAt the same time, Big Mom receives dozens of gifts from her guests. One of them, Morgans, points out that she is rumored to have received a gift from the royalty of Fishman Island. Big Mom confirms this information and places in front of her pile of gifts the Tamatebako, the legendary chest handed down from generation to generation in King Neptune\u0027s family. She says she\u0027ll open it along with the other gifts at the banquet after the wedding.\n\nFor his part, Bege sees his men return and Vito triumphantly announces that all the preparations are ready. Satisfied, Bege brings Caesar Clown out of his body with the mirror and reminds him of his current mission: to place the mirror somewhere in the hall so that it can be used as an exit. The door, which is a Homie, begins to suspect that something is up, and Gotti cuts the Homie\u0027s face in half with his sword, killing him instantly. Bege decides to check on the Straw Hats and looks inside his fortress-body: the pirates are asleep, totally slumped over. Jinbei is the only one awake. He tells Bege, who is calling out to them, to let them rest, as they haven\u0027t slept a wink. Fishman takes charge of the guard and wakes them up ten minutes before Bege\u0027s plan is to be carried out. The latter tells Caesar that he is now ready to attend the Tea Party, at which point there will be no way back.\n\nOn the ninth floor, the bride and groom stand side by side. Pudding, in her wedding dress, says with an innocent, emotional look (a tear seems to soak the bottom of her eye) that she feels like she\u0027s living a beautiful dream. This seduces Sanji, but his inner voice reminds him that Pudding is deceitful and that she will try to murder him. However, Sanji remains torn between reason and infatuation, to the point of thinking that the time he saw Pudding\u0027s true nature may have been a hallucination. The latter finds Sanji\u0027s behavior rather strange and asks him what\u0027s wrong. Her fianc\u00e9 retorts that he doesn\u0027t know how he\u0027ll kiss her. Amused, Pudding replies lovingly on the lips, causing Sanji to haemorrhage from his nose and lose consciousness.\n\nNot far away, on the rooftop, Capone Bege attends the Tea Party and carefully observes all the participants celebrating. Among them, he sees the Vinsmoke having a good time, as well as members of the underworld and Streusen, the chef, who is jumping up and down at the success of the dishes he has served, while Vinsmoke Jajji is happily toasting with Big Mom. Bege is accosted by Perospero, who asks him if all is well, while the Straw Hats, all awake except for Luffy, wait for the right moment to come out. For his part, Sanji has fully recovered and is changing, unaware that Pudding is pointing a gun at him without his knowledge. The young woman must quickly hide it in her dress when a guard tells her that everyone is waiting for them for the wedding ceremony. Outside, the clock strikes noon and the excitement is at its peak. The public address announcer, armed with a snail phone, informs the audience that the long-awaited wedding is about to begin and duly introduces the bride and groom, who arrive flying on Prometheus\u0027 back. They are cheered and applauded by all the Tea Party guests. However, Bege feels that Sanji is overplaying his role as groom by sticking a little too close to Pudding...",

        "description": "Two minutes after the arrival of the bride and groom, Jinbe, in the company of Caesar Clown, desperately tries to wake up Luffy, who is fast asleep in Capone Bege\u0027s body, but to no avail. Nami, however, has the solution, relayed by Chopper: Luffy must be able to eat meat to wake him up!\nMeanwhile, the Tea Party is in full swing since the arrival of Sanji and Charlotte Pudding. Everyone cheers as the newlyweds take to the air on Zeus\u0027 back. Pudding uses her strength against the conquered Sanji, who is unaware of the young woman\u0027s true intentions and desire for his death. However, the time is ripe for celebration, and chef Streusen, accompanied by his faithful cooks, sings a song in honor of the bride and groom and brings out of the ground, in front of all the astonished Tea Party guests, the marvelous wedding cake he has made. The huge cake makes Big Mom salivate, and she can\u0027t wait to taste it. But she holds back and congratulates Streusen on his talented work.\n\nAt the top of the cake is a dome where the priest awaits Sanji and Pudding as they arrive on Zeus. As the bride and groom take their places under the dome, the Vinsmoke settle down around their allotted table and Big Mom looks forward to their future deaths, as do her children, who are looking forward to a blood banquet. For his part, Yonji says he would have liked to be in his brother\u0027s place, but is called to order by Niji, who tells him that marrying one of Big Mom\u0027s daughters is a sacrifice that means being under the Empress\u0027s orders for the rest of his life. For her part, Reiju, who is aware of the assassination plot concerning her family, notes that they are surrounded by members of the Charlotte Family and have been easy prey since Bege and his men confiscated their weapons at the start of the Tea Party. She also believes that Sanji must escape and that she trusts Luffy to do so. Under the dome, the priest prepares to recite the bride and groom\u0027s vows in front of Sanji and Pudding, who face each other.\n\nAs the wedding ceremony draws to a close, Capone Bege stands by while his men, led by Vito and Gotty, equip themselves with KX spears to assassinate Big Mom. For his part, Luffy emerges from his long sleep having smelled the succulent aroma of roasting meat as Nami had predicted. The Straw Hat opens his eyes and devours in one sitting the food Bege\u0027s men have just brought him. But Jinbe is in a hurry and orders Luffy to leave the meat to concentrate on their mission. However, the Straw Hat has his own way, forcing his Fishman friend to drag him by force through the Mirror World, before the astonished eyes of their companions, who follow close behind in the wagon pulled by Diesel.\n\nAt the same time, Sanji and Pudding listen attentively to the priest\u0027s words and are about to exchange vows, while Luffy, devouring a large piece of meat, complains about being late and Jinbe lectures him. In the audience, Charlotte Katakuri has a flash. He sees his sister Pudding in the future, crying in front of Sanji and wonders why. Just as the priest asks Sanji to lift Pudding\u0027s veil and kiss her, Charlotte Smoothie notices her brother\u0027s confusion and asks him what\u0027s wrong. Capone Bege has also noticed his attitude. He understands that Katakuri has seen into the future and fears for the success of his plan.\n\nThe crucial moment has now arrived. Sanji gently lifts the veil from Pudding, who is about to draw his weapon just as her new husband catches sight of her third eye. Amazed at first, he tells her he thinks it\u0027s beautiful. At these words, Pudding is stunned and drops her pistol, which falls to the ground. She starts to cry and Sanji apologizes, thinking he\u0027s hurt her. For her part, Big Mom wonders why her daughter hasn\u0027t killed Sanji yet, while Pudding remembers her mother\u0027s plan. She breaks down crying at Sanji el\u0027s feet, asking him if he wasn\u0027t making fun of her. Between sobs, she confessed that no one had ever told her that her third eye was beautiful. Sanji was the first to tell her that, and she couldn\u0027t believe it. She revealed that this handicap had been a source of mockery ever since she was born. For as long as she could remember, Pudding had been considered a freak and rejected all her life. To defend herself, she adopted a demonic attitude and used her third eye to scare everyone.\n\nSeeing the young woman continue to cry, Sanji knelt down to comfort her, but Pudding insulted him, ordering him to leave her alone. She tells him she\u0027s a horrible three-eyed monster and must kill him. A wave of anxiety sweeps through Big Mom\u0027s other children. Charlotte Mont d\u0027Or wonders what Pudding is doing with the plan, and Big Mom signals to the priest to shoot Sanji. The priest pulls a gun from his cassock and aims it at the groom. In one of his visions, Katakuri sees Sanji dodge the cleric\u0027s shot and takes it upon himself to kill the young pirate by shooting him with a jelly bean. However, Sanji avoids Katakuri\u0027s shot, which hits the priest in the head and kills him. Katakuri\u0027s dodge caught him unawares and Sanji glared at him. However, before dying, the priest manages to fire a shot and the sound of the detonation alarms all the Tea Party guests. For their part, Luffy and his friends also hear the shot and realize that things have begun to get serious. This is the beginning of the operation to recover Sanji and assassinate Big Mom.\n\nLike all the other wedding guests, the Vinsmoke don\u0027t understand the situation as Katakuri arrives in front of Big Mom to take up a defensive position, gun in hand. Big Mom asks him what\u0027s going on, and Katakuri replies that something is happening that he himself could do nothing to stop. Like Big Mom\u0027s second son, the Empress\u0027s subordinates wonder what they should do. As a tearful Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e apologizes for having been forced to do what the Straw Hats wanted, the wedding cake suddenly begins to shake. Everyone wonders and starts to panic, while Capone Bege flashes a smile of satisfaction. Suddenly, the cake explodes. Dozens of Luffy jump out, screaming and devouring the cake before Big Mom\u0027s hate-filled eyes...",

        "description": "Big Mom watches in fury as the wedding cake she was desperate to eat is destroyed by dozens of furious Luffy clones. Capone Bege also witnesses this scene, and remembers his meeting in his HQ three and a half hours before the wedding. He had explained to Luffy his plan to emerge from the wedding cake with clones after Bege had placed a mirror in it to facilitate his passage from the Mirror World dimension to their own, with the aim of smashing Mother Caramel\u0027s portrait. The mob boss had ordered Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e to make Luffy clones from animals that the Straw Hat had managed to capture in the Seductive Woods and transform them using Mira Mira no Mi.\nIn the present, Br\u00fbl\u00e9e\u0027s efforts have paid off, as Luffy has his multitude of clones bursting out of the cake. Big Mom is horrified at such an affront, while Du Feld wonders if it was all part of the show, which Big News flatly denies as he recognizes the protagonist of his future scoop, Monkey D. Luffy, a prominent member of the Worst Generation. He and his clones bring the wedding cake crashing down on the guests, while Sanji saves the weeping Pudding by using the Moon Step to send them flying. The young groom knows that the crucial moment has finally begun and, as he flies over the Tea Party, catches sight of Mother Caramel\u0027s portrait on Big Mom\u0027s table. He inwardly hopes that Luffy will succeed for the sake of the mission. While the Empress loses her temper at the sight of Luffy destroying her cake, Charlotte Mont d\u0027Or must face up to the fact that her brother Charlotte Opera had lied to her.\n\nIn a fit of rage, Big Mom rises from the table to see her long-awaited wedding cake crumble before her very eyes. Streusen, her head pastry chef, tries to calm her down, but to no avail. Three of his cooks ask him to leave, but they notice Big Mom\u0027s eyes welling up with hatred as she demands a new cake. Faced with Streusen\u0027s inability to do so, the Empress uses her Soru Soru no Mi on the unfortunate three cooks under the greedy gaze of Morgans, who doesn\u0027t miss a beat and calls this method \u0022Soul Pocus\u0022: Big Mom can take a certain portion of life expectancy from her target in proportion to the latter\u0027s attachment to life, or more trivially, fear.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Mirror World, Nami, aided by Jinbei, Carrot, Chopper, Caesar Clown and Pedro, frees Luffy\u0027s clones one by one via a mirror activated by Br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Br\u00fbl\u00e9e tries to reach the real world, but is prevented from doing so by Jinbei. Jinbei orders his companions to join the Tea Party after the last \u0022Luffy\u0022 is freed. Nami gladly accepts, leaving behind Caesar Clown, whom she calls a loser. The former master of Punk Hazard swears revenge once he\u0027s got his heart back.\n\nOn the roof of the Whole Cake Ch\u00e2teau, Big Mom is increasingly angry and confirms that those who deprive her of the cake must die. She recalls her altercation with Luffy when he was on Fish Island and orders him to identify himself at once. In his corner, Capone Bege revels in the spectacle, but is dismayed when the real Luffy openly reveals himself to the Empress. He can\u0027t believe his eyes when the young pirate proudly stands before her!\n\nAfter spotting the portrait he was supposed to destroy, Luffy runs off in the direction of Big Mom, while his clones sow panic in the Tea Party. For his part, Capone Bege observes and warns his followers Vito and Gotti, safe in his body, to be ready with their KX rocket launchers. But Big Mom calls Zeus and Prometheus to help her pulverize the Straw Hat. She doesn\u0027t have time, however, because her son Charlotte Katakuri has already found the real Straw Hat among his clones and trapped it in a sticky substance created by his Demon Fruit. He explains to his surprised mother that the other clones are actually forest animals transformed by Br\u00fbl\u00e9e\u0027s power. He also reveals that the real purpose of Chapeau de Paille was to break Mother Caramel\u0027s portrait. He knew the importance of this photo to Big Mom and the impact it would have on her if he destroyed it. Katakuri wants to know who told Luffy about the photo, but the Straw Hat stubbornly remains silent under Bege\u0027s panicked eyes. Katakuri tries to make him talk, but Pedro tries to free his friend. He doesn\u0027t have the time, however, as Jinbei is the quickest and goes to the Straw Hat\u0027s rescue using Fishman karate.\n\nWith this action, Jinbei has revealed his betrayal of Big Mom. He also explained to Luffy that Katakuri had eaten the Mochi Mochi no Mi and that touching him was to be avoided at all costs. In front of the Empress\u0027s astonished eyes, Jinbei tells her that it was he who revealed Mother Caramel to Luffy and that he has decided to leave his crew to join Luffy\u0027s immediately. Big News is delighted by this turn of events, and doesn\u0027t miss a moment of it. For her part, Big Mom reminds him of the price to be paid if he leaves his crew, and Jinbei is ready to have his life time taken, provided Big Mom doesn\u0027t stand in the way of his companions\u0027. The Queen of Totland then asks him the fatal question \u0022Life or Stay?\u0022, but fails to extract life from Jinbei. Indeed, the Fish Man was not afraid of Big Mom. Given that he was a man who wanted to be part of the crew of the future King of Pirates, he couldn\u0027t be intimidated by a mere Yonk\u014d! And as if this affront wasn\u0027t enough, Jinbei knelt before the Empress and took out of the folds of his kimono the cup of sake Big Mom had given him to solemnly signify his crew\u0027s departure. This act of rebellion brings joy to the hearts of Jinbei\u0027s companions, who hope that he will soon join their crew. For his part, Big Mom congratulates Jinbei on his decision and projects the full power of Prometheus\u0027 fiery rays on him, for his former pirate has become his new enemy!\n\nWhile all eyes are on the Fish Man, Brook, disguised as Luffy, sneaks between the tables to approach the one containing Mother Caramel\u0027s portrait. Without warning, he smashes it with a hammer...",

        "description": "While Big Mom violently attacks Jinbei and Luffy with the help of Prometheus, causing panic among the Tea Party guests, Brook, disguised as Luffy, takes advantage of the commotion to smash Mother Caramel\u0027s portrait with a hammer. Several people witness his act and freeze in horror when they see Brook tear off part of his Luffy disguise. They thought he was tearing off his own skin. For her part, Big Mom, on the verge of hysteria, recognizes Soul King, whom he thought dead, and asks him if he knew the importance of this photograph. As for Capone Bege, he and his men are ready for action, armed with their KX rocket launchers. But instead of screaming as expected, the Empress goes berserk and ransacks everything in her path, causing further panic among her guests. Bege anxiously asserts that there are three seconds left before Big Mom goes into hysterics. She asks Brook again if he realizes what he\u0027s doing, and her irritation is fleshed out by the fact that she remembers the disaster Luffy caused on the wedding cake. Big Mom is divided, as the two events are of equal gravity for her, which doesn\u0027t immediately send her into a devastating rage. While Brook is being hunted by Charlotte Mascarpone, Luffy and Jinbei battle Big Mom\u0027s men to stay alive before she loses her mind.\nWitnessing the carnage, Vinsmoke Jajji asks Charlotte Perospero on behalf of her family to take back their weapons to face Big Mom\u0027s enemies. But the eldest son of the Charlotte family refuses his request, saying he will defend the Vinsmoke family alone. Meanwhile, Sanji flees the Tea Party, carrying Charlotte Pudding in his arms to safety. But the young woman, reminded of her duties to her mother, tries to shoot him with a pistol but repeatedly fails. She \u0022asks\u0022 him to be frightened by the sight of her third eye, pointing out that this is what she used to fool everyone. Sanji retorts that she has fooled herself, a phrase that moves the young woman deeply.\n\nSuddenly, Daifuku, the third son of the Charlotte family, appears and tries to kill Sanji, but to no avail. Pudding\u0027s older brother, also Minister of Beans, is transformed into a genie emerging from a lamp: he possesses the Hoya Hoya no Mi, a Paramecia-type fruit. He attacks his sister because she\u0027s the reason the assassination plan failed. He hits her before launching a new attack against Sanji, sending his genie to hit him with his spear. At the same time, in Mirror World, Caesar Clown moves at full speed with Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e on his back, saying he\u0027s about to use her because her heart is at stake.\n\nWhile Sanji fights valiantly against Majin, who appears to be a tough opponent, Big Mom is on the verge of losing her sanity, staggering and still lamenting the loss of Mother Caramel\u0027s precious portrait. Meanwhile, Luffy and Jinbei jointly battle the men of the Charlotte Family. Suddenly, the Straw Hat is violently tackled to the ground by Bege, who tells him he\u0027s going to kill him. As head of security, he wants to appear credible to Big Mom\u0027s pirates. While Jinbei is fiercely fighting several opponents at the same time, Charlotte Oven appears and attempts a surprise attack on the Fishman. He is prevented from doing so by Pedro, who comes to his friend\u0027s defense. But Pedro warns him not to hit Oven, as he has the ability to turn everything he touches white-hot. It\u0027s too late, as the Mink\u0027s sword has become incandescent. For his part, Oven remembers Pedro\u0027s visit and is amazed that he went to Tougato with the sole aim of dying there!\n\nFor their part, Chopper, Nami and Carrot are frightened not to see Big Mom screaming and feel that the three seconds needed to kill her have already passed. Suddenly, Mascarpone, who was chasing Brook, manages to decapitate him and his screaming head lands just a stone\u0027s throw from Luffy and Bege. The living skeleton reassured his friend that he was all right. Suddenly, an immense scream rings out. It comes from the Vinsmoke table, which is completely engulfed in Perospero\u0027s care, and more specifically from Jajji, who bursts into tears after realizing that an assassination plot is being hatched against them. Seeing guns pointed at him and his children, he blames Big Mom for betraying his trust and continues to weep, while Perospero rejoices. The Vinsmoke brothers behave in a peculiar way: they keep smiling and giggling, knowing that they\u0027ll soon be dead. For her part, the silent Reiju deduces that her brothers behave differently from their father because they are psychologically inhuman.\n\nJajji\u0027s sobbing makes all the Tea Party guests laugh, including the sensation-hungry Morgans, who shamelessly photographs the distraught face of the Germa 66 leader. The latter, after shouting that he had given all he could to conquer the nations of North Blue, calls out to Big Mom to say something, but the Empress is still in a state of shock. Brook advises Luffy to show the broken photo of Mother Caramel to Big Mom so she can scream. Bege then realized that his plan was going to work, as he noticed Charlotte Katakuri\u0027s annoyed expression as she stepped in front of him and deduced that the future was going to be disastrous for the Charlotte Family. Keeping his cool, the mafia godfather calls on his team, shouting at them to put on their \u0022Invisible Sinphonia\u0022. Nami\u0027s group understand his words and get the earplugs ready, while Bege, followed by Jinbei and Pedro, stride confidently in front of Katakuri. Katakuri asks the pirate to shoot Luffy on the spot, but Bege refuses. He tells Katakuri that, whatever his ability to see into the future, he doesn\u0027t have what the others have: the ability to change the future...",

        "description": "With weapons still trained on the Vinsmoke family and Jajji crying his eyes out, Sanji runs towards his family, eliminating the Big Mom men blocking his path one by one, only to be overtaken by Charlotte Daifuku, determined to exact his revenge. Meanwhile, Caesar Clown heads for the roof entrance, where he places the mirror that will serve as an emergency exit. Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e complains, and the scientist takes the opportunity to observe the situation: he can\u0027t understand why Big Mom hasn\u0027t started her hysteria fit, even though the plan is going according to plan and Mother Caramel\u0027s photo has been destroyed. For his part, Luffy takes the pieces of the portrait and runs to try and show them to Big Mom to make her scream again. Charlotte Katakuri tries to stop him, but the combined intervention of Capone Bege, Jinbei and Pedro prevents him from stopping the Straw Hat. Using her powers of divination, Katakuri discovers Bege\u0027s treachery, and is quick to machine-gun him in front of Big Mom\u0027s son\u0027s companions. But the gangster\u0027s bullets have no effect on Katakuri.\nWhile his allies protect his back, Luffy runs towards Big Mom, who continues to walk aimlessly. Sweeping aside all his enemies who tried to stop him, the Straw Hat was about to succeed if Charlotte Oven hadn\u0027t stopped him in his tracks by grabbing his elastic arms in her burning hands. In pain, Luffy drops the fragments of the portrait to the ground, where they are picked up by his adversary. The latter warns him that he won\u0027t be able to use them again. Brook didn\u0027t take kindly to this and, taking his sword from its scabbard, approached to help his friend in his mission. The living skeleton freezes Oven in place and retrieves the pieces of Mother Caramel\u0027s photo, which he promptly hands over to Luffy. But Charlotte Oven frees herself from her icy prison by using her body heat. Faced with this danger, Brook advises his friend to carry out his mission while he personally takes care of their adversary. The Straw Hat obeyed and ran back to Big Mom, while Brook went to confront Oven in single combat.\n\nNot far away, Capone Bege, as a tenacious pirate, continued to shoot at Katakuri, who was unscathed. The weary Katakuri lunged at Bege, taking advantage of the moment to order Charlotte Perospero to execute the Vinsmoke as quickly as possible. The eldest son of the Charlotte family obeys his order and tells Jajji that he and his children have no choice but to die. The leader of Germa 66, who continues to cry, complains about not having his \u0022raid suits\u0022 with him. Suddenly, Sanji arrives at the table where his family members are imprisoned, ordering Reiju to flee, but he is hot on the heels of Charlotte Daifuku, who throws her genie at his heels with the aim of eliminating him. Sanji parries her attack and continues on his way. Despite Vinsmoke Yonji\u0027s taunts, Reiju believes that her younger brother possesses the last trace of goodness left in the Vinsmoke family. In her mind, she\u0027s ashamed of being a Vinsmoke and thanks him for all the kindness he shows. But Sanji is quickly overtaken by Daifuku\u0027s genius, who slams him to the ground while Perospero puts his plan into action.\n\nWhile Luffy\u0027s clones wreak havoc among the Tea Party guests, Nami, Chopper and Carrot witness the murder of the Vinsmoke Family, still at the mercy of Big Mom\u0027s men. The young sailor wonders where Luffy is. Carrot suddenly spots him running in the direction of Big Mom, taking with him the fragments of Mother Caramel\u0027s portrait. After battling his clones who wanted to block his path, the Straw Hat manages to catch up with Big Mom, but Katakuri pursues him, much to the dismay of Bege, Pedro and Jinbei. The third child of the Charlotte Family uses his gifts to stop Luffy, but is prevented from doing so by Pedro, who blocks his path. Jinbei then intervenes to attack Katakuri, who suddenly disappears to continue his hunt. Bege then appears and machine-guns Katakuri to give Luffy time to complete his mission. Fed up, Big Mom\u0027s second son neutralizes the gangster\u0027s weapon and manages to engulf the Straw Hat before it can approach his mother.\n\nJust as he thought he had Luffy at his mercy, Katakuri has a vision, and his fear becomes great when he sees the young pirate\u0027s elastic arms reach out towards Big Mom\u0027s face to show her the pieces of Mother Caramel\u0027s portrait. Seeing the shattered photo, the Empress freezes in horror, then lets out a shrill scream that thunders across the roof of Whole Cake Ch\u00e2teau. Everyone tries to isolate themselves from the sound, but the Haki of Kings emanating from Big Mom causes many of her subordinates to falter. As Nami, Chopper, Carrot, Pedro and Jinbei put in their earplugs, Luffy, who was right next to them, is thrown off balance by the sound power, and the Vinsmoke struggle to stay conscious. Fortunately for them, Charlotte Mont d\u0027Or collapses and some of the pistols surrounding them fall to the ground. Chopper, Nami and Carrot take advantage of this moment to plug the Vinsmoke\u0027s ears, while Sanji, freed from the grip of Charlotte Daifuku\u0027s genius, flushes his legs to free his family members from their sugary prison. Before Vinsmoke Jajji\u0027s astonished eyes, Sanji proudly stands upright on their table, after his friends have handed over their weapons to the various members of the Vinsmoke Family.\n\nAs Big Mom continued to scream, Gotti and Vito emerged from Capone Bege\u0027s body and loaded three KX rocket launchers to fire at the Empress. Suddenly, the Empress dropped to her knees and blood began to pour from one of her knees. Seeing that she was now vulnerable, Bege\u0027s group prepared to shoot her, while Charlotte Smoothie watched helplessly and Big Mom pondered why Mother had left, abandoning her alone on the New World island of Erbaf sixty-three years ago...",

        "description": "Eyes rolling, Big Mom screams as Luffy desperately plugs his ears with his hands to keep from fainting. With tears in her eyes, the Empress looks at Mother Caramel\u0027s broken portrait and asks her why she left. Grief-stricken, Big Mom delves into her memories, going back sixty-three years to when she was five. She remembers her parents taking her to the island of Erbaf, then leaving because her father had work to do nearby. To console her, Linlin\u0027s mother told her that she would be able to eat all the sweets available to her, which made her very happy. The young Big Mom saw her parents off and discovered, after gobbling up all her supply of sweets, that they hadn\u0027t come back to fetch her as promised. She waited a long time for them, her stomach churning with hunger. What the girl didn\u0027t know was that her parents had decided to abandon her because she was out of control and causing too much trouble. Big Mom\u0027s father knew that there was a \u0022Holy Mother\u0022 on the island who would take good care of his child. Indeed, Erbaf legend has it that a hundred years ago, the two captains of the giants\u0027 crew had disappeared and, as a result, the other crew members were captured by the Navy and put to death. On the day of the execution, a woman named Sister Caramel arrived and dissuaded the Navy from executing the pirates. She told the authorities that they should be forgiven for their sins and that leaving them alive would be a wiser choice, because if they died, other giants would form a pirate crew seeking revenge on humans. After this event, Caramel became known as \u0022Mother Caramel\u0022 and founded an orphanage called \u0022La Bergerie\u0022, where she took in children of all races and status who had nowhere else to go.\nThirty-seven years later, when Mother Caramel was in her eighties, she took Big Mom into her orphanage and got to know the other boarders. She told the little girl that she had to live with her until her parents came to take her away. Linlin agreed, and the other children took her for a giant because of her height. When Linlin arrived at the Bergerie, she met a young prince who had been expelled from his country after a coup d\u0027\u00e9tat, and a child who had once been a slave. However, things were different for the young Big Mom, who had always been taller than the other children. The people of Erbaf took her for one of their own, and she felt at home because everything she saw - people, houses and objects - was her size. One day, however, she wanted a bear and a wolf to live together in a cage, but the bear ate the wolf, so, in disappointment, she hit the bear. She told Caramel that she only needed one blow to kill the bear, which surprised her interlocutor. Nevertheless, she understood Linlin, who was the only one on the island. She told her that she had tried to create a friendship between the bear and the wolf, which was a good thing. Many rumors were circulating among the children about Big Mom, which gave a violent image to the little girl who nevertheless wanted to create harmony around her. One day, she tried to rip the arm off a Long-Arm because she thought it had an extra limb and that it wasn\u0027t normal. Caramel stopped her from doing so and eventually forgave her for all her foolishness. Ten months later, Linlin was living with the giants. Some were still thinking about Broggy and Dorry, who had been fiercely fighting each other for almost 40 years! These were the same giants with whom Luffy and his friends had later befriended. Gerd, a fellow giant like Linlin, informed him that the traditional fasting period had arrived. Indeed, all giants had to fast for twelve days in a row to celebrate the winter solstice with dignity. After this long period of recollection, they could eat again. Her friend told her she could still drink water. Meanwhile, Hajrudin, then a very young warrior, was training for battle until Dorry or Broggy returned to take over the Giant Crew. Suddenly, two very old giants appeared. They are Yorle Barbecade, founder of the Giant Crew, and Yarle Barbemont.\n\nThey order the children of the Bergerie to be warned that they are about to eat semla, an absolutely delicious sweet that delights Big Mom to no end. Gerd explains that the giants eat semla in preparation for fasting. But Linlin, having just tasted one of his cakes, decides to gobble up all the semlas, much to the astonishment of the Erbaf inhabitants who see the little girl eating without stopping! Some of the giants tried to reason with her, but to no avail. Nevertheless, the great fasting period arrived and Lilin succumbed to hunger on the third day. She struggled for the next few days and finally broke down on the seventh day. A frightened Gerd informed Mother Caramel that a serious incident had taken place: Linlin had destroyed the entire village of giants! Caramel found Linlin shouting \u0022Semla\u0022 and using the Haki of Kings for the first time to demand semla. This incident earned her a reprimand from Yorle Barbecade, who told her she was not worthy of the rebirth of the sun. He then brandished his sword and tried to kill her, despite Caramel\u0027s pleas, while Linlin continued to demand semla...",

        "description": "Just as Yorle\u0027s sword was about to strike Linlin, the latter broke the blade with a sharp blow from her forearm. In addition to stunning the giant chief, the little girl grabbed him by the beard and sent him tumbling violently over her, to the astonishment of the entire village. The villagers run to see if their leader is all right, only to discover that he is seriously injured! Witnessing the scene, Caramel asks a woman to fetch some semla left in reserve to calm Linlin while she puts out the village fire. She uses her strange power: she performs the \u0022Gevurah\u0022 attack and causes energy to rise from her palms, animating the fire. A face appears on the fire, as if suddenly endowed with consciousness, and Caramel names Pandora. At the same moment, two giants immobilize Linlin when the village woman arrives with a crate of semla. The little girl escapes from the giants\u0027 arms and goes to devour all the cakes.\nWhile Linlin satisfies her hunger, Caramel addresses the fire. She asks it to calm down, and in an instant all the fire disappears to concentrate on a tiny sun-like ball, still with a face, which obeys the nun. The townspeople are in awe of such a prodigy, while Yorle, his face bleeding, orders Linlin eliminated. Her call is heard by her brother-in-arms, Yarle, who rushes in to try and slice the girl open. But Caramel steps in and begs for mercy. She convinces the giant to let the girl live, as she is only an orphan. She assures him that she will take Linlin with her and leave the country. Convinced by her words, Yarle spares Linlin\u0027s life and, a few days later, Linlin attends Yorle\u0027s funeral, unaware that she was responsible for the giant\u0027s death.\n\nAfter this event, Mother Caramel left Elbaf, taking Linlin and all her prot\u00e9g\u00e9s with her to found a new Bergerie on another island. A new life begins; but behind the scenes, Caramel works for the World Government and talks to Cipher Pol agents about the children in her care. In addition to being a benevolent nun, Caramel is a child trafficker who has been in business for almost 50 years. Every two years, she delivers most of the children she takes in to the World Government to be used as agents in its service. With her talents, she reminds one of the Cipher Pol members that it was she who delivered John Giant to make him the Navy\u0027s first giant soldier. She negotiates a large sum of money with them in exchange for Linlin, justifying the fact that she possesses power comparable to that of an admiral, or even a chief admiral.\n\nThe agent with whom she has just negotiated is convinced, and says he will do everything he can to pay the sum. Some time later, the orphans are having fun with Linlin, singing in the Bergerie. Indeed, they are celebrating Linlin\u0027s birthday and his friends have prepared a lovely surprise for him to celebrate his sixth birthday: a pile of semla called Croquembouche, and Linlin is ecstatic as he starts to taste it. Mother Caramel and the other children help her taste it and even stuff the cakes in her mouth. The taste is so delicious that Linlin cries with joy, her tears gradually masking her vision. Strangely, when she finishes eating and her vision clears, she no longer sees any orphans, not even Mother Caramel in front of her. The flashback ends with Linlin crying out in that moment of incomprehension, and in the present, Big Mom screams \u0022Where are you, Mother?\u0022 and sweeps the entire roof of the Whole Cake Ch\u00e2teau away with the sheer force of her Haki. Stunned by such power and unable to understand what\u0027s happening, Pedro and Luffy struggle to stand...",

Capone Bege\u0027s gang and the members of the Straw Hat Crew, wearing earplugs to protect themselves from the noise, are on the alert to take down the Empress. The Empress again takes refuge in her memories. She had no idea that two people had witnessed Linlin\u0027s birthday scene. An Elbaf warrior who had come to check on the new Bergerie and was terrified by what he saw. He left the island to rejoin his people, to whom he told what he had seen. All the giants of Elbaf and the other islands, still mourning Yorle\u0027s death, heard what had happened and hated Charlotte Linlin even more for her misdeeds, so much so that no one dared speak her name. The other witness to the scene was a cook and former pirate who lived on the island where Mother Caramel\u0027s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s had moved in. His name was Streusen and he loved everything he saw. He decided not to leave Linlin alone, as it would have been a shame for such a monster to die so young. He possessed the powers of Kuku Kuku no Mi.\nNoticing that the little girl was hungry, Streusen used his power to feed her, and through their meeting they became the co-founders of Big Mom\u0027s Crew. In the present day, Capone and his men take advantage of Big Mom\u0027s distress to shoot her with their KX rocket launchers, while Streusen and Charlotte Linlin\u0027s children look on helplessly. The latter continues to lament and plead in vain for her mother\u0027s name. She had explained to Streusen that one of Caramel\u0027s great dreams was to found a country without discrimination, where everyone would be equal. After Linlin had demonstrated her ability to use Caramel\u0027s Demon Fruit by making the flowers and trees in the forest come alive, Streusen decided to help young Linlin realize her dream. Meanwhile, Navy soldiers had landed on the island to search for Caramel, but came face to face with Linlin\u0027s creatures. They took fright and fired on the flowers and singing trees. Linlin witnessed the slaughter and took revenge by eliminating the soldiers under the satisfied eyes of Streusen, who didn\u0027t have the Navy in his heart. The two set sail and showed what they could do. Soon, a bounty of 50,000,000 Berrys was promised on Linlin who, despite her tender age, proved to be a terrifying pirate. One day, she took over a castle under the nose of the Navy, using her two Homies, Prometheus and Zeus, and promising, with the help of Streusen, who supervised everything, peace in exchange for sweets and a happy life in exchange for a life of obedience or death.\n\nBack to the present. Charlotte Linlin remembered her dream of eating at Caramel\u0027s table with all her friends from the Bergerie, but she felt sad. Indeed, the only existing portrait of Mother Caramel had been destroyed by the Straw Hats and she would never forgive them. Just as Capone Bege and Luffy think they\u0027ve succeeded in their plan, Big Mom\u0027s voice is so powerful that she destroys the missiles before they reach her. All the Empress\u0027s enemies are extremely surprised, but they waste no time. They immediately tried to flee. For his part, Caesar Clown springs into action, using his powers to break through the perimeter wall and bring the mirror to serve as an emergency exit. However, Big Mom\u0027s scream is such that it shatters the mirror to pieces! On their side, Big Mom\u0027s children, equipped with earplugs made by Charlotte Katakuri, approach them, determined to avenge the affront committed against their mother. Luffy and his allies soon realize that they have no retreat, and that a confrontation with the Charlotte family, however unequal, seems inevitable...",

While the Fire Tank pirates attack Big Mom\u0027s crew, Charlotte Mont d\u0027Or realizes that Bege has betrayed her and wanted to assassinate Big Mom. Other members of the Charlotte Family wonder if Bege had intended to betray them all along.\nMeanwhile, Du Feld finds some mochi and uses it as earplugs to stop hearing Charlotte Linlin\u0027s horrible screaming. Happy to be silent again, he suddenly notices among the gifts for Big Mom the presence of Tamatebako, the legendary treasure of Fish Island. He decides to open it, grab the contents and replace it with something else, without seeing or knowing. At the same time, in the commotion, C\u00e9sar Clown jostles everyone to get into \u0022Big Father\u0022 first. Just as he\u0027s done so, a powerful arm grabs him and pulls him towards it. It\u0027s Charlotte Katakuri who, with her siblings, has gathered to eliminate all their enemies. The former master of Punk Hazard takes fright and wants to flee. He is prevented from doing so by the bag hanging behind his back, containing Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, still tied up, who is delighted to be reunited with her big brother. Fortunately for C\u00e9sar, the fastener on his rucksack snaps and he makes his way inside the huge fortress, while Br\u00fbl\u00e9e is reunited with her family.\n\nWhile Luffy desperately waits for Nami, Chopper and Carrot, who have stayed behind, the Charlotte Family sets out to attack Big Mom\u0027s attackers. For her part, Nami manages to pick up her friends and run as fast as she can towards the fortress before its huge door closes. But they are overtaken by Big Mom\u0027s men, who block their path. Suddenly, Charlotte Smoothie seizes Nami before Sanji\u0027s helpless eyes. Chopper tries to free her, but runs into Charlotte Oven, who shows him what he\u0027s made of. Carrot then takes over, but has to face Charlotte Daifuku and her terrible genie.\n\nSanji is overwhelmed by what he sees. He looks imploringly at his father, who understands. The latter decides to call on the power of Germa 66 by dressing himself and his children in their battle outfits of unparalleled technology. Far from being impressed, Charlotte Perospero recognizes the immense potential of these armors, which even resist fire! He points out that the Vinsmoke\u0027s metamorphosis isn\u0027t enough, as he intends to immobilize them with candy. But it\u0027s too late, as members of Sanji\u0027s family have already sprung into action: Vinsmoke Niji, aka Electric Blue, defeats Chopper from Charlotte Oven\u0027s embrace, while Vinsmoke Yonji, aka Winch Green, frees Carrot from Charlotte Daifuku\u0027s clutches. Meanwhile, Vinsmoke Reiju, aka Poison Pink, delivers a powerful kick to Smoothie. In a panic, Nami is thrown into the air, but is caught by Sanji, under the impressed eyes of Charlotte Pudding. As for Luffy, he helps his friends get into the fortress by eliminating their pursuers. The members of Germa 66 are not forgotten, as they too enter \u0022Big Father\u0022.\n\nTaking advantage of the general commotion, Du Feld prepares to open the precious safe. But, much to his surprise and the power of Yonko\u0027s voice, the Tamatebako flies off and falls from the top of the Whole Cake Ch\u00e2teau! For his part, Capone Bege sees that Big Mom is still vulnerable and decides to attack her again, firing cannonballs at her. But his attack is stopped by a wall of candy erected by Perospero. Bege tries to fire his fortress cannons again, but they are all blocked by mochi thrown at them by Katakuri. Undaunted, Bege tries to crush Big Mom under the caterpillar tracks of his huge fortress, but fails again as they are stuck with Perospero\u0027s candy and can no longer roll. Over the loudspeakers in his castle, Bege breaks the bad news to his allies, reminding them that they\u0027re about to be surrounded by Big Mom\u0027s pirates.

        "description": "While Big Mom continued to scream at the top of her lungs, her children continued to lay siege to Big Father. For her part, Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e has rejoined her family, but is severely lectured by her older brother Charlotte Katakuri, who suspects her of having used her power to help their enemies. Br\u00fbl\u00e9e swears that this is not true, as she was the victim of the Chapeaux de Paille and their allies.\nMeanwhile, Capone Bege meets up with his associates inside the huge fortress, and Luffy takes the opportunity to congratulate him on the extent of his power. The mobster calms the young pirate\u0027s nerves with the cold news that the plan to assassinate Big Mom, which he had been meticulously preparing for over a year, has come to nothing. Bege also reveals that this is the first time his organization has failed to kill anyone. Jinbei then asks Bege what he intends to do next.\n\nAt the same time, outside the fortress, Big Mom has stopped screaming. Katakuri takes the opportunity to tell her about Capone Bege\u0027s betrayal. The Empress is stunned by this news, while her former subordinate explains to her comrades the strengths and weaknesses of Shiro Shiro no Mi. Indeed, should their enemies destroy \u0022Big Father\u0022, Bege would die immediately, as the strength of his power is linked to the solidity of his castle. Should this happen, the castle\u0027s occupants would fall prey to the members of the Charlotte Family, who will be ruthless after Bege\u0027s affront to their mother.\n\nIndeed, outside the castle, Big Mom has regained her senses and is using all her power to confront her enemies. Eyes flushed with anger, the Empress strides towards Big Father and violently strikes at his walls. The assault is lightning-fast, and inside the fortress, Capone Bege is writhing in pain. His allies and wife don\u0027t understand what\u0027s happening to him. Bege explains to Luffy that they are under attack from outside. Through a castle window, the Straw Hat and his friends catch sight of the Yonko\u0027s bulging eye, ordering them out of the fortress. All occupants of \u0022Big Father\u0022 take fright, as they know that Big Mom knows about Capone Bege\u0027s betrayal.\n\nBig Mom continues her attack and, in full view of her children, throws furious punches that further demolish Bege\u0027s fortress. The martyred Bege tells his comrades that Yonko has come to her senses and is determined to exact her revenge. Bege\u0027s face is bloodied from the beating, which alarms his wife Charlotte Chiffon, who wants to help him but can do nothing.\n\nDrunk with anger, Big Mom yells at Bege and Luffy to get out of the fortress immediately. This was too much for Charlotte Chiffon, who finally appears at the window to ask her mother to calm down. But Big Mom\u0027s anger escalated when she saw her daughter, the spitting image of Charlotte Laura. With extreme hatred for her daughter, she threw a violent punch at Chiffon, who was saved in extremis by Luffy, who grabbed her with his elastic arms. The Empress\u0027s new attack further shakes \u0022Big Father\u0022, who threatens to collapse.\n\nIn a threatening tone, Big Mom understands that Chiffon has also conspired against her and announces that she will suffer the same fate against the other plotters. As they continue to pound Capone Bege\u0027s fortress with their fists, her children look on from behind and coordinate among themselves to capture all the occupants of \u0022Big Father\u0022, the Fire Tank Pirates and their allies, the Straw Hats, Jinbei and Germa 66. For his part, Luffy, seeing Bege suffering martyrdom, decides to take action and leave the fortress to fight Big Mom. He is prevented from doing so by Chopper, who tries to reason with his friend. Nami then takes over, reminding her captain that they\u0027ve completed the various missions assigned to them, and now it\u0027s time to find a way to escape. Brook agrees with Nami and asks Luffy to leave for the land of Wa, where Zoro and the rest of his companions are waiting.\n\nHowever, Bege\u0027s situation continues to worsen. He feels Big Mom\u0027s repeated blows to his fortress, and it\u0027s wearing him down. But, in a final burst of pride, he pulls himself together, knowing that his wife, child and precious subordinates are by his side. Faced with yet another attack from Big Mom that weakens him further, Bege suddenly explains to his companions that there\u0027s only one way for everyone to escape unharmed.\n\nAs Big Mom continues to beat the crap out of \u0022Big Father\u0022 and his children wait with bated breath for the survivors, Bege reveals that the only way out is for all his \u0022guests\u0022 to enter a secret chamber inside his body. What\u0027s more, everyone notices that the only person to suffer damage is Bege. Bege then explains his new plan: by taking shelter in his body, Luffy and all his allies will always be safe. Then, when the mobster has returned to his human form, Caesar Clown will take him with him into the air to a safe place. Hearing this, the former master of Punk Hazard becomes angry, as he doesn\u0027t want to put his life unnecessarily at risk.\n\nFar from his concerns, Vinsmoke Jajji breaks his silence and asks Sanji why he wanted to save his family, who had despised him since childhood. The young pirate replies that he did it to make himself worthy in the eyes of his adoptive father, Zeff, who had taken him under his wing after taking him in. Then, taking his progenitor by the scruff of the neck, Sanji coldly announces that he no longer considers him to be his real father, and this in full view of the other members of the Vinsmoke Family! Jajji accepts his choice and makes a solemn promise to stay away from the Straw Hats, their relatives and East Blue.\n\nMeanwhile, Big Mom continues her undermining and manages to breach Big Father\u0027s wall. Everyone in the fortress panics, including Caesar Clown, who is reluctant to sacrifice his life. Suddenly, Vinsmoke Jajji emerges from his reserve and orders the main gate to be opened. He wants the members of Germa 66 to act as escorts to guarantee the pirates\u0027 escape. With this decision made, Germa 66, as one man, leaves \u0022Big Father\u0022 to confront Big Mom. For his part, Capone Bege, in possession of Caesar\u0027s heart, forces him to obey. Defeated, Caesar agrees to cooperate and accompanies Germa 66 to the castle gate. There, Bege deactivates Big Father and reverts to his human form. For their part, the Vinsmoke Family stand ready for battle, while Caesar Clown takes fright at the sight of Big Mom\u0027s menacing silhouette looming over him...",

        "description": "Capone Bege has finished disabling \u0022Big Father\u0022 before the eyes of Big Mom\u0027s children. They point their pistols at Germa 66 and Caesar Clown. The latter, fearing for his life, takes fright. He is soon joined by Bege as a horrific firefight begins, destroying all the Tea Party furniture in the process. When the smoke clears, Big Mom has the unpleasant surprise of seeing Bege and Clown still alive. They had been protected from the bullets by the invulnerable bodies of the members of Germa 66. The latter order Punk Hazard\u0027s former master to flee, taking Capone Bege with him.\nAs everyone flees by air, Charlotte Katakuri has a premonition that the fugitives are going to fly over the perimeter wall. He tries to stop them, but is stopped in his tracks by Vinsmoke Jajji, who tries to pierce him with his spear. Katakuri orders his siblings to catch up with their enemies, while Big Mom seizes Prometheus to attack the members of Germa 66. Her maneuver is brutal and Big Mom succeeds in neutralizing Reiju, who falls to the ground before the helpless eyes of Niji and Yonji, who are quickly brought to order by older brother Ichiji, who orders them not to help their sister and to continue their mission. The latter is not injured, but she is the target of attacks by Charlotte Mascarpone and Charlotte Joscarpone, who want to eliminate her. However, the young woman is stronger than them and poisons them on first contact. They owe their salvation to Charlotte Smoothie, who comes to their rescue and eliminates the poison in their bodies. Suddenly, Big Mom returns to the charge and attacks Reiju again, this time taking Zeus who transforms into a menacing black cloud filled with lightning. This is too much for Luffy and Sanji, who emerge from Bege\u0027s body to lend Reiju a hand. Unaware of the danger awaiting them, the two pirates stop Big Mom\u0027s attack in front of the stunned Empress. Luffy then remarks to Sanji that he had said not to go out, but Sanji replies that this did not apply to him. Still in Bege, Nami, Chopper and Brook are frightened by their friends\u0027 lack of responsibility.\n\nMeanwhile, Big Mom had pulled herself together and hit the ground in an attempt to stop her enemies, while Sanji took the Straw Hat with him, escorted by Reiju, who had recovered from her emotions. The Yonk\u014d had not forgotten the offensive words the Straw Hat had dared to utter against her when he was on the Isle of the Fishmen - those he had uttered when he was a prisoner in his jail. She\u0027d held a grudge, and now that Luffy was at her mercy, she could finally get her revenge. For fun, she called him a coward. This remark hurt Luffy\u0027s feelings, and Sanji found it hard to calm his friend down. But Luffy is outraged and, activating the Gear Fourth, he takes on Big Mom in single combat.\n\nIn the turmoil, a panicked Nami wonders what Luffy is up to, as do Brook and Chopper. As Big Mom\u0027s men take aim at Capone Bege and the three remaining members of the Vinsmoke Family, Vito reassures his boss\u0027s guests that they are protected by Germa 66 and that nothing serious will happen to them. Indeed, when the bullets start flying, Bege and C\u00e9sar are protected by the impenetrable bodies of Niji, Yonji and Ichiji, much to the exasperation of the Charlotte Family, who wanted to shoot the fugitives in mid-air. Some try to stop them, but they are no match for the enormous power of the three Vinsmoke brothers!\n\nCaesar Clown, carrying Capone Bege on his back, is pleased with the spectacle, but is stopped in his tracks by Charlotte Oven, who vows to burn alive all her mother\u0027s enemies. He is prevented from doing so by Vinsmoke Yonji, who blocks his attack to give Caesar time to escape with his precious passenger. A fierce battle ensues between the fourth son of the Vinsmoke Family and the fourth son of the Charlotte Family. Yonji, who is not afraid of fire, fights like a lion against his adversary, while Caesar makes his escape. However, he is caught by Charlotte Daifuku and her dangerous genie. Niji comes to the rescue of Caesar and Bege to fight Daifuku fiercely. Happy to be saved, the scientist continues on his way until he is stopped by Charlotte Smoothie, who promises to hug them until they are breathless. She makes good on her threat, but is stopped in her tracks by Ichiji, who confronts Smoothie in a terrifying fight, with the sole aim of giving Bege and Caesar enough time to get over the perimeter wall.\n\nWhile Bege machine-gunned his pursuers with the help of the men he\u0027d conjured out of the palm of his hand, Caesar Clown was ecstatic to be within sight of the perimeter wall. But his joy was short-lived. Charlotte Perospero, who had noticed the two runaways, uses her power to build a huge wall of candy to block Clown\u0027s path. Witnessing the scene, Jajji is aghast at the turn the situation has taken, while the scientist laments that he won\u0027t soon be free. His sadness suddenly fades when Niji , Yonji and Ichiji come to his aid and use their respective powers to shatter the imposing candy wall, which is instantly pulverized into thousands of pieces before Perospero\u0027s annoyed eyes. Caesar Clown takes advantage of the opportunity to flee, thanking Germa 66 for saving him. This same gratitude can be felt by the Bege men still inside his body.\n\nFor his part, Du Feld manages to reach the Tamatebako, which had fallen from the castle ramparts. But he is shot by Stussy, who turns out to be a CP-AIGIS0 agent. Unfortunately, Du Feld\u0027s body landed on the box, causing it to fall into the void while Big Mom and Luffy were about to fight. Before facing him, the Straw Hat swears that as soon as he has knocked Kaidou over, it will be Big Mom\u0027s turn to suffer the same fate. He throws a Haki-coated punch at his opponent, who counters with his Haki-coated arm. Charlotte Linlin retorts, evoking Kaidou, that the young pirate cannot defeat this \u0022thing\u0022, while the Straw Hat is taken away by force by Sanji. Big Mom goes after them to destroy them. But Jajji stops her in her tracks and confronts her. Charlotte Linlin retaliates with a lightning attack, knocking out the Germa leader with the help of Zeus. Her golden mask shatters before the eyes of her children and Sanji, who is left speechless...",

        "description": "Vinsmoke Jajji\u0027s golden mask shatters under the impact and the leader of Germa 66 collapses face down to the ground as Big Mom looks on in satisfaction. Transported into the air by Caesar Clown, Capone Bege witnessed the scene and believes that the head of the Vinsmoke Family is dead. At this word, Jajji\u0027s sons abandon the pirate to see what\u0027s going on below. Caesar is not pleased with this turn of events, and laments his fate. He was right to worry, as he came face to face with Charlotte Katakuri, who blocked his path. Just as he was about to settle the score, Bege and Clown were saved in extremis by Vinsmoke Ichiji, who had rushed to their aid. But Katakuri was not defeated. After seeing Clown escape with Bege, he decides to face Ichiji in a one-on-one fight.\nMeanwhile, Big Mom was about to deliver the coup de gr\u00e2ce to the still-breathing Vinsmoke Jajji. Just as she was about to strike at her victim, she saw Niji and Yonji appear from the sky to save their father. Their arrival is sudden, but the Yonk\u014d is not surprised. Sweeping Jajji\u0027s lifeless body away, she confronts her sons while Ichiji prepares to fight Katakuri. At the same time, Caesar Clown and Bege try to escape. The mobster uses his powers to machine-gun his enemies, but Clown suddenly decides to retrace his steps and break through the castle wall. Bege tries to dissuade him, telling him it\u0027s dangerous. But the former master of Punk Hazard has a mind of his own. Inside Bege, Nami and Chopper are terrified. They wonder where Luffy and Sanji are right now.\n\nThe two young pirates are in the company of Reiju, but the Straw Hat is in bad shape after his fight with Big Mom. He is carried by his friend, while the three are pursued by Charlotte Oven, Charlotte Daifuku and Charlotte Smoothie, who warn them that there is no escape. Reiju asks his brother to flee with his friend, but Sanji refuses. He decides to face his three adversaries alone. An epic battle begins. Sanji valiantly takes on Oven and then the genius of Daifuko, unaware that his sister has not left. She too was fighting on her side against the tenacious Smoothie, who was annoyed that her opponent couldn\u0027t perish so easily. The latter then hit her leg with poison, while Big Mom\u0027s daughter sent her enemy flying away. Reiju got up without a scratch and watched her opponent with a smile.\n\nNot far away, unafraid of fear, Ichiji rushes to confront Katakuri. But the forces are unequal, as the eldest Vinsmoke is defeated. However, he has not said his last word. After revealing to Katakuri that his mission was to buy time for his allies to escape, Ichiji uses his powers to weaken Katakuri in front of his family. Not far away, Big Mom tries to eliminate Niji and Yonji. But they prove to be tough opponents who manage to thwart the Empress\u0027s plans. Bege\u0027s \u0022guests\u0022 are astonished by their bravery. Suddenly, Nami urges Caesar to fly faster, cursing him at the same time. The scientist complies, grumbling, but comes face to face with his double. Not understanding what was happening to him, he starts fighting himself! In fact, it was a little trick played by Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e to get her revenge.\n\nAt the Tea Party, Big Mom is attacked by the two Vinsmoke brothers, but it has no effect on her. She seized Zeus and struck Niji and Yonji down without mercy, inflicting excruciating pain. Meanwhile, Ichiji believes he has defeated Katakuri, but he returns to strangle her. Meanwhile, Smoothie gets rid of the poison in her thigh to deal with Reiju. Having immobilized her, Smoothie draws his sword from its scabbard to deliver the coup de gr\u00e2ce. Reiju lets out a scream that alarms Sanji. The latter is taken prisoner at the same time as Luffy by Charlotte Galette, before the horrified eyes of their friends in Bege\u0027s body.\n\nAll seems lost. This is the terrible realization of Caesar Clown. Ichiji is strangled by Katakuri, Sanji, Reiju and Luffy are down against Big Mom\u0027s pirates, and the other two Vinsmoke brothers are in Big Mom\u0027s hands. The Bege hosts also witness this and have no choice but to fight. For her part, Big Mom observes the scene with amusement, then orders her children to begin the executions. However, Katakuri has a premonition and sees the Tamatebako falling. Stussy and Morgans are just as stunned as he is, as they watch helplessly as the chest falls and explodes. The inside of the Tamatebako had been booby-trapped with sticks of dynamite. The explosion shook Tougato Castle to the core.\n\nNot everyone in Whole Cake Ch\u00e2teau understands what\u0027s happening, but the castle begins to crack and threatens to topple over the lower town. However, before this incident, a flashback occurs, showing the episode where King Neptune learned that Luffy had given the Tamatebako to Big Mom. He had conjectured that, with luck, the bomb would not explode. Back to the present. The explosion of the Isle of Fishmen\u0027s safe has severely damaged the Whole Cake Ch\u00e2teau. All the occupants are frightened as the corridors collapse in front of them. Baron Tamago suspects an enemy attack. The Tougato Castle collapses and the inhabitants of Sweet City below panic. On the roof, Stussy and Morgans realize that the blast was caused by the Tamatebako, while Luffy, Sanji and the other Vinsmoke manage to save themselves. Niji and Yonji manage to recover their father, while Big Mom is about to fall into the void.\n\nAs the roof continues to shake, the pirates inside Bege don\u0027t understand what\u0027s happening. For her part, Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e is horrified by everything she sees. She suddenly sees Big Mom tumbling down without stopping, and ends up falling into the void as Capone Bege looks on in hilarity, seeing his assassination plan finally come to fruition and rejoicing at the sight of Big Mom\u0027s crew being annihilated...",

For his part, Sanji, carrying Luffy who is still unconscious, has gone in search of Reiju. As for Big Mom, she continues to fall into the void before the horrified eyes of Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, who doesn\u0027t know what to do to save her mother\u0027s life.\nAt the bottom of the castle, the inhabitants of Sweet City flee, completely terrified because Big Mom\u0027s castle is bigger than their town! Meanwhile, Morgans and Stussy, also falling into the void, witness the end of Big Mom\u0027s crew. Suddenly, the young woman uses the Moon Step to slow her fall, while Morgans, ever eager for a scoop, drops like a stone.\n\nMeanwhile, Sanji continues to make his way through the debris of the Tea Party and spots Capone Bege being carried through the air by Caesar Clown. He tells them to wait for them, and Bege\u0027s \u0022hosts\u0022 are relieved to see their friends still alive. They are joined by Reiju and Ichiji. As Sanji and Luffy make their way back inside Capone Bege\u0027s body, he orders Caesar to flee the castle as quickly as possible. The scientist doesn\u0027t hesitate, while Ichiji orders Yonji and Niji to flee too, with their father still unconscious.\n\nAs everything collapses, the cook from Big Mom\u0027s crew, Streusen, uses the \u0022V\u00e4ndanrern Gourmet\u0022 technique to turn the entire castle into a cake, thus preventing it from collapsing. The inhabitants of Sweet City are literally submerged by layers of thick cream, but are saved. As for Big Mom, her fall is cushioned by Zeus, who had rushed out to save her life. When all the inhabitants of Whole Cake Ch\u00e2teau regain consciousness and Big Mom is seized by a sudden craving for cake, Charlotte Mont d\u0027Or orders her subordinates to alert all the islands of Totland not to let the Straw Hats and Fire Tank Pirates escape.\n\nAt the same time, to the north-west of the island, Caesar Clown has taken Capone Bege to a safe place. There, the mobster invites his \u0022guests\u0022 to leave his body and tells them it\u0027s time to part ways. After saying these words, he gives Caesar\u0027s heart back to him, but the scientist is insulted by Nami while Luffy has regained consciousness. For his part, Vito notices that the inhabitants and crew of Big Mom have all survived. Bege says you mustn\u0027t linger and immediately leaves with his crew, without bidding farewell to the Straw Hats.\n\nMeanwhile, on Big Mom\u0027s side, Katakuri orders Daifuku to split into two groups: one to kill Luffy, the other Bege. The problem is that Big Mom isn\u0027t well. In fact, the Queen of Totland is extremely frustrated at not having been able to eat her wedding cake, and exclaims \u0022wedding cake\u0022 in an angry voice before the terrified eyes of her daughter Charlotte Smoothie.\n\nCraving more, Big Mom demands her wedding cake and causes panic among her subjects. Even Charlotte Opera flees! Opera is arrested by his sister Smoothie, who admonishes him for lying to his family members about the death of the Straw Hat. Opera tries to make amends by blocking his mother\u0027s path, while the soldiers of Germa 66 wonder what happened to their leaders. They discover they\u0027re surrounded by Big Mom\u0027s crew, who want to conquer the Germa kingdom.\n\nNearby, to the northwest of the island, Brook tells his friends of his plan: with Chopper\u0027s help, he will use the Shark Submerge III to reach the Sunny, while the rest of his companions, led by Luffy, will hurry back to the coast where they docked. For his part, C\u00e9sar takes advantage of the situation to regain his freedom. Meanwhile, Tamago, transformed into a rooster named \u0022Niwatori\u0022, asks how the Whole Cake Ch\u00e2teau fell. His sidekicks claim that it was the crew of the Straw Hat and Bege who conspired to undermine the Tea Party. Big Mom\u0027s children wonder what caused the explosion, and Niwatori points out that all communication systems in the hall have been cut off. He also tells them that the crew of the Sun Pirates have fled. This information is confirmed by Pekoms, who has managed to reach Sweet City. He is informed of Jinbei\u0027s decision to leave Big Mom\u0027s crew and join that of the Straw Hat. Meanwhile, Charlotte Daifuku informs her brother Katakuri that her group is in pursuit of the Straw Hat Crew and Firetank, while another group is invading the Kingdom of Germa. Satisfied, Katakuri asks his sister Br\u00fbl\u00e9e to accompany him. The latter agrees, as she has a score to settle with the Straw Hats who used her to kill Big Mom. As for Katakuri, he wants to behead Luffy because he has become a serious threat to his mother.\n\nSuddenly, Smoothie appears and orders his siblings to flee town as quickly as possible, because Big Mom has gone mad! In fact, she\u0027s starting to smash house walls with her fists, while demanding wedding cake...",

Claiming her wedding cake, she terrorizes the townspeople, who flee at the sight of her. Charlotte Mont d\u0027Or suddenly notices that her mother has Charlotte Opera in her hand, and throws it in the direction of her children. Mont d\u0027Or approaches him and discovers that his brother is unconscious. He deduces that Big Mom has absorbed his life span, while she continues to wreak havoc on Sweet City.\nNearby, Luffy\u0027s group head for the coast, running as fast as they can to escape their pursuers. They decide to cut through the Tempting Forest to quickly reach the Sunny. At the same time, Big Mom is still subject to her murderous craving, much to the dismay of her daughter Smoothie. Smoothie knows that the only way to calm her mother down is to give her what she wants. So she enlists Streusen\u0027s immediate help. But she discovers that Streusen is seriously injured and in need of treatment. For his part, Pekoms witnesses Big Mom\u0027s madness and is terrified. Perospero doesn\u0027t like this situation and decides to act before it\u0027s too late. He makes his mother believe that the wedding cake hasn\u0027t disappeared and that another has been specially prepared for her. His brothers and sisters take fright at this lie. Perospero continues his tirade and confesses to his mother that he would have gladly given her the wedding cake, but it has been stolen by the Straw Hats! He reveals that they are currently heading for the south-west coast of the island to escape.\n\nBig Mom, who doubts his son\u0027s sincerity, threatens to take his life, then orders Zeus to accompany him to capture the Straw Hats. Prometheus also joins in, and the three of them leave Sweet City to give chase to the pirates. For his part, Perospero sees his mother off with some trepidation. If Big Mom catches up with the Straw Hats and finds they haven\u0027t got her cake, Perospero is a dead man! The only solution is to bake another cake while the Empress is away, but this is an impossible undertaking. Indeed, the only man capable of making such a cake is Streusen, but he\u0027s currently in a coma! According to Katakuri, the island will be destroyed and he doesn\u0027t know what will happen next. Suddenly, Charlotte Pudding arrives on her magic carpet and says she plans to create a luscious chocolate mousse, with the help of Charlotte Chiffon. Her brothers point out that Chiffon is currently their enemy, but Pudding, with a terrified look on her face, opening her third eye and pulling out her pistol, asserts that Chiffon will obey her without question. She goes on to explain that there are still some \u0022mythical\u0022 ingredients in reserve and that she will prepare the cake in Chocolate Town, on Cocoa Island. This is where Big Mom must be taken if she returns after defeating the Straw Hats.\n\nMeanwhile, Luffy\u0027s group accelerates to escape and is in sight of the Seductive Woods. They find King Baum recovering from his wounds and talking to Lady Tree. Nami manages to tame the Homie thanks to the half of Charlotte Laura\u0027s Life Card she had managed to keep. The group flees at full speed, but a team of Big Mom\u0027s Crew have spotted them and are in pursuit. Suddenly, the fugitives hear Big Mom exclaim \u0022wedding cake\u0022 and see her chasing them from Zeus in the air.\n\nThe soldiers of Big Mom\u0027s crew notice her and are astonished to see her like this. Suddenly, the Empress unsheathes Napoleon in the form of a spear and flies over King Baum to attack him, shouting \u0022wedding cake\u0022 and ordering Luffy to hand it over. At the same time, in the Kingdom of Germa, fighting rages between Germa 66 and Big Mom\u0027s troops. While the latter take over the secret laboratory where the clone soldiers are made and the throne room, Vinsmoke Jajji\u0027s children appear and eliminate all their enemies one by one with the power of their weaponry.\n\nAt the same time, Big Mom comes dangerously close to attacking King Baum. Jinbei struggles to hold back Luffy, who wants to fight the Empress. He reminds him that their only priority is to return to the Sunny. The Straw Hat understands the situation and obeys. Just as Big Mom is about to catch up with them, Luffy orders King Baum to make a dash for the Sunny. Meanwhile, aboard the ship, a mysterious shadow emerges from a mirror to await the young pirates.\n\nNot far away, near the Seductive Woods, the Empress orders Luffy to hand over the wedding cake. The Straw Hat doesn\u0027t know what she\u0027s talking about, while Nami urges King Baum to run faster. Big Mom tells them they\u0027re about to receive the Spear of Elbaf. Jinbei then understands that they are about to suffer a violent attack from Big Mom and warns her friends. The Empress shouted \u0022Erbaf Spear: Ikkoku\u0022 as she launched her attack. The tree manages to narrowly dodge it, but Big Mom\u0027s power sends all King Baum\u0027s occupants flying...",

Luffy uses his elastic arms to pull all his companions back onto the trunk of the King of the Temptation Forest before they are swept away. The Empress\u0027 murderous power terrifies the pirates, who can\u0027t believe their eyes. Luffy realizes that Big Mom has used a fighting technique belonging to the Elbaf Giants. Suddenly, the head of the Charlotte Family begins to attack King Baum, who tries to apologize for his disobedience. Nami suddenly asks him who the tree was he was talking to before, and he replies that it\u0027s Lady Tree, his fianc\u00e9e. She convinces him to survive, whatever the cost to his bride.\nWhile King Baum speeds off to escape Big Mom, she\u0027s still clamoring for wedding cake. Straw Hat, who realizes that the only solution is to confront her, is about to leave King Baum\u0027s summit, but is held back by Nami. The young sailor then has an idea and uses her Climat-Tact to try a little experiment. Just as Big Mom is about to launch a new attack, Nami uses the \u0022Black Ball\u0022 technique, which consists in creating small black clouds that are supposed to produce lightning bolts to strike their opponent. But Zeus, attracted by the electric clouds, forgets his mission and swallows them, knocking his mistress off her feet as Napoleon and Prometheus look on in annoyance. Big Mom falls heavily to the ground, while King Baum takes off in the direction of the Tempting Forest, still pursued by Zeus who demands more black clouds. Nami hopes to reach the Seductive Woods in time, where they will have the upper hand over their pursuers, for King Baum is the master of this forest. Indeed, his subjects, who can see him from afar, are waiting impatiently for him. The latter move aside to make room for him, and Luffy, who witnesses this prodigy, suddenly notices the Sunny wisely moored on the shore in the distance, seemingly waiting for them.\n\nMeanwhile, fighting continues in the Kingdom of Germa. The children of Vinsmoke Jajji inflict a crushing defeat on the soldiers of Big Mom\u0027s Crew. Thanks to their sophisticated battle outfits, the Vinsmoke have the advantage over their enemies, who are no match for them.\n\nNot far away, Big Mom, armed with Napoleon transformed into a sword, moves quietly towards the Tempting Forest, while the baited Zeus obediently follows King Baum, hoping to receive more electric clouds. The latter arrives at Nami\u0027s level and kindly asks her to make him those little storm clouds he finds so delicious. The young sailor was astonished by this request and agreed on the sole condition that Zeus become her servant. He accepts her proposal without batting an eyelid, but Big Mom has caught up with them and is still clamoring for wedding cake. A confrontation seems inevitable. Shaking the ground of the Tempting Forest, Big Mom and Prometheus sport an angry grimace that terrifies everyone in the Seductive Woods. The Yonk\u014d orders them to stop the fugitives and, suddenly, King Baum is stopped in his tracks by his own subjects.\n\nBig Mom\u0027s anger grows and she strides heavily towards King Baum. But King Baum, blinded by his love for Lady Tree, sweeps aside the trees in front of him to flee. Encouraged by Nami, King Baum continues his mad dash under the wrathful eyes of Big Mom. Luffy, Sanji and Pedro lend a hand to help him make his way to Sunny. Suddenly, a stifling heat descends on King Baum, who is overcome with fear. Prometheus has become enormous! As punishment for his betrayal of Big Mom, he crashes into the seductive ruler of the Woods and incinerates him to death before Nami\u0027s helpless eyes! Fortunately, the pirates standing on top of his trunk climb down in time, but are swept away by the blast.\n\nNami is traumatized by this horrific sight, but she must flee with her companions if she is to reach the Sunny safely. Behind her, Big Mom is still hot on her heels, her eyes bulging with anger. Meanwhile, in Sweet City, the situation is shaping up to stop Bege and Luffy under the orders of Charlotte Mont d\u0027Or. In the Mirror Word, Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e has gathered 10,000 soldiers ready to attack their enemies. The 19th son of the Charlotte Family orders the ships cruising Tougato Island to surround the Straw Hats\u0027 ship to prevent their escape. At the same time, aboard the Thousand Sunny, Charlotte Katakuri and her men take over the ship and wait for the pirates to return to their ship.\n\nMeanwhile, Capone Bege, in tank mode, is pursued by Big Mom\u0027s Tart Tanks. They fire bombs at him, which the Fire Tank Pirate leader easily dodges. But he is caught by Charlotte Pudding thanks to her flying carpet. She asks him to see her sister Chiffon immediately on a very important matter. The mafioso is astonished by this request and accepts. Pudding calls his sister and asks her to help him soothe their mother\u0027s new murderous crisis. She tells him that Big Mom wants to eat a wedding cake. A rather special cake, since it\u0027s a chocolate chiffon cake. And it\u0027s thanks to this dessert that they\u0027ll be able to calm their mother down. Unfortunately, Chiffon has decided otherwise. She coldly tells her younger sister that she has every intention of leaving the country, just as her twin Charlotte Laura had done. But Pudding reveals to Chiffon that she doesn\u0027t want to save her mother, but Sanji, the man she\u0027s fallen madly in love with, and his friends...",

        "description": "On the south-west coast of Tougato Island, just a stone\u0027s throw from where the Sunny is moored, a terrible fire ravages the Tempting Forest. Many homies perish under the flames caused by Prometheus\u0027 attack. Because of Big Mom\u0027s murderous hunger, the Straw Hats have no choice but to flee. Luffy, unaware of the evil affecting the Empress, asks Jinbei for an explanation. The Fishman complies, revealing that this murderous hunger is in fact a state of craving. He explains to his friends that as long as she doesn\u0027t eat what she wants, Big Mom will destroy everything in her path without hesitation. In this trance-like state, she\u0027s almost unconscious, but she\u0027s still lucid enough to know what she wants: a wedding cake! Jinbei points out to her comrades that the Yonk\u014d didn\u0027t have any more snacks during the wedding ceremony.\nAs they make their way through the Tempting Forest, the pirates smash a large number of homie trees that were trying to block their way. Luffy takes this opportunity to confess to his friends that he has tasted the wedding cake and found it tasty. On hearing this, Sanji reprimands him for having dared to eat during the mission when he had no right to do so. Surrounded once again by the inhabitants of the Tempting Forest, Luffy and his friends neutralize them and finally come within sight of a bridge spanning a river. Carrot remembers the place and says they\u0027re not far from their ship. But Nami suddenly has her doubts. The young sailor remembers that the bridge was broken when they arrived on the island and deduces that it\u0027s a trap. She is also convinced that the inhabitants of the Tempting Forest are altering the environment to deceive them, and that they should be on their guard.\n\nMeanwhile, near the River of Juice in Sweet City, the team tasked with reaching the Sunny via the Shark Submerge III arrives in sight of the river. Brook suddenly notices that the river is filled with fresh cream, which Chopper likes and begins to devour. Not far away, in the Tempting Forest, Luffy\u0027s group advances towards the bridge. The Homies are still surrounding them, while Big Mom is hot on their heels, escorted by her men. However, Nami and her friends must reach the Sunny, and Charlotte Laura\u0027s Life Card has no effect on keeping the Homies out of their way. Indeed, this is due to the nearby presence of Big Mom. Their only way out is to use Zeus, who seems very fond of Nami\u0027s little electric clouds. Thanks to him, they\u0027ll have a slight advantage over Big Mom, especially if Nami continues to feed him her Black Balls.\n\nBut the Empress yells at her cloud to come back to her immediately. To make matters worse, Prometheus gets involved and criticizes Zeus for disobeying Big Mom. The latter, baited by Nami\u0027s delicious clouds, loses interest in his comrade, who is promptly challenged by the Straw Hat, who is out to get him. Luffy hasn\u0027t forgotten that it was Prometheus who destroyed King Baum and wants to avenge his death. So he attacks him, but his punches, even when induced by Haki, have no effect on him. The immense sun shoots jets of fire at the pirates and Jinbei is forced to dive into the river. He emerges shortly afterwards to fend off Prometheus with a Fishman Karate attack, throwing water at the fireball and extinguishing its flames. Jinbei takes advantage of this moment to order his friends to cross the bridge with him while their adversary is weakened.\n\nAt the same time, Chopper and Brook arrive at the mooring of the Shark Submerge III. They find that the submarine is surrounded by fresh cream, just like the inside! The little reindeer, who had already gorged himself, takes charge of getting rid of this continuum by sneaking inside the submersible. Meanwhile, the pirates continue their desperate escape through the Tempting Forest, but come face to face with Tablet, Compo, Laurin, Mobile and High-Fat, all members of Big Mom\u0027s crew, as she comes up behind them. Caught in a pincer movement, Luffy and his friends have no choice but to confront their adversaries.\n\nMeanwhile, Brook and Chopper sail the Shark Submerge III up the river of juice to reach the sea. But they cross the path of a huge tiger-fish that stands in their way! They flee, but are pursued by the strange animal. At the same time, Straw Hat and his comrades come under attack from Big Mom\u0027s men. The fight is fierce, and both sides return blow after blow without faltering. In the end, Luffy and his friends triumph over their enemies without the slightest difficulty. For her part, Jinbei lends a hand to Nami, who is struggling to get away with some Homies. The young woman thanks the Fish Man for his help and continues to coax Zeus. Jinbei then calls out to Luffy, telling him not to disperse, but to stick together no matter what.\n\nAs they continue to run, they are overtaken by Big Mom and Prometheus, who is determined to get his revenge. But faced with a hostile environment, the pirates don\u0027t stand a chance. Suddenly, Carrot has an idea. She\u0027ll launch herself into the air to find out where Sunny is. She puts her plan into action, but is thwarted by a Homie tree, which gives her a root kick. Sanji, as a knight in shining armor, cushions the fall of the young Mink, who thanks him for his help. Pedro takes over and, after felling a few trees with his sword, manages to find the place where the Sunny was moored. He decided to stay behind and guide his friends back to their ship. But Big Mom was still behind them. She brandished her sword and launched several lightning attacks on the fugitives, as did Prometheus, who strafed them with flaming jets. Soon, Luffy and his companions found themselves trapped by Big Mom and her faithful Sun. However, all was not lost for them. There was still Zeus, who greedily gobbled up Nami\u0027s last electric cloud. By ingesting it, Zeus had transformed into a huge black cloud filled with electricity. The young sailor decided to use the \u0022Tempo\u0022 attack on Zeus, and a bolt of lightning from the latter violently struck Big Mom, sweeping away everything in its path...",

Chopper suddenly discerns silhouettes on the Sunny\u0027s stern and deduces that his friends are already on board waiting for them. Brook accelerates the speed of their submarine and quickly reaches the surface to find their companions. But when they arrive in front of the Thousand Sunny, they discover that it\u0027s not their friends, but their enemies! Charlotte Perospero, accompanied by Charlotte Katakuri, calls out to the two pirates, telling them he\u0027s sorry their friends aren\u0027t waiting for them.\nMeanwhile, in the Forest of Temptation, the force of Nami\u0027s attack has created an immense cataclysm that has struck Big Mom and caused huge ripples on the surrounding sea. Brook and Chopper, tossed about on the Shark Submerge III, struggle to keep their balance; but when everything calms down, the two pirates look anxiously at the island\u0027s forest, wondering if Luffy and his friends have made it through. For his part, Perospero is pleased with what he sees. He thinks that his mother has managed to finish off her enemies, thanks to Zeus, and that now it\u0027s time to guide her to Pudding so that she can eat the cake her daughter has prepared for her. Then, addressing his two enemies, Perospero coldly tells them that their companions are probably dead. But Brook and Chopper don\u0027t believe him. Perospero gives them the chance to escape, but the pirates refuse. Chopper metamorphoses and Brook draws his sword, ready to fight together to retake their ship. After neutralizing arrows fired by archers, Brook and Chopper manage to land on the deck of the Sunny, but are surrounded by numerous enemies.\n\nNot far away, in the Tempting Forest, the immense smoke dissipates. Luffy and his friends believe they have triumphed over Big Mom, but are quickly disillusioned when they hear the voice of the Empress clamoring for wedding cake. The lightning had not received her. Indeed, Big Mom managed to escape the crater by braving the rocks that had crumbled down on her, and emerged enraged. Luffy\u0027s group had no choice but to start running again, despite the ground caving in beneath them.\n\nMeanwhile, Brook and Chopper battle Perospero\u0027s soldiers on the deck of the Sunny, easily defeating them. However, they have their hands full with a man in armor. The living skeleton manages to freeze him, while Chopper throws him overboard off the Sunny.\n\nAt the same time, Pudding and Chiffon fly over the Tempting Forest on Rabian. Big Mom\u0027s 35th daughter had convinced her sister to help her. Despite her husband\u0027s misgivings, she had agreed to follow her on this adventure because the Straw Hats had helped Charlotte Laura in the past, and it was time to return the favor. Soon, Chiffon and Pudding were on the trail of the pirates. They were running away from Big Mom. Suddenly, Pudding spotted Sanji and couldn\u0027t help stammering his name, so infatuated was she with him. But, to Chiffon\u0027s amazement, Pudding suddenly changes her appearance, revealing her third eye with a rictus of hatred. At the same time, Big Mom tries to extricate herself from the ground while demanding cake, but the ground gives way beneath her. Just then, Pudding and Chiffon arrive. Luffy and his friends are astonished by their presence and don\u0027t understand why they\u0027re together. Pudding tries to explain, but the sight of Sanji makes him lose all his nerve. Suddenly, a huge noise is heard. It was Big Mom who had managed to free herself from the ground.\n\nAs she flies over the pirates, Pudding is torn between two aspects of her personality: on the one hand, she\u0027s madly in love with Sanji, and on the other, she has an immoderate hatred for the pirates, to whom she predicts an atrocious death. Big Mom will chase them to the ends of the earth to see them die! But her sister Chiffon manages to pull her together and explains the whole situation to Luffy: Big Mom believes the Straw Hats have stolen the wedding cake she was desperate to eat. Charlotte Chiffon then enlists Sanji\u0027s help as a cook to make the substitute cake that will calm his mother\u0027s murderous hunger, and in exchange for this service, she will help him and his friends escape. Nami is taken aback by Chiffon\u0027s proposal. Chiffon explains to her friend that she wants to pay her debt to the Straw Hats for saving Laura at Thriller Bark. Sanji, convinced by Chiffon\u0027s words, accepts her proposal. Capone Bege\u0027s wife explains to the Straw Hat Crew\u0027s cook that the ingredients will have to be fetched from Chocolate Town. Sanji, Chiffon and Pudding will fly directly to Cocoa Island on Rabian\u0027s back to make the cake. Once finished, they deliver it to the Chapeaux de Paille, who have managed to leave Tougato Island, but are pursued by Big Mom. When she sees the cake, she stops chasing them. Convinced by this plan, Sanji agrees to follow Chiffon and Pudding, reluctantly leaving his friends behind. He promises to return soon. But Big Mom, her eyes red with hatred, sees his daughters and thinks they\u0027re on the side of her enemies. She strikes again with her sword just as Chiffon and Pudding manage to escape. Luffy and Sanji agree to meet at sea and, just as the Empress launches her new attack, Sanji manages to grab the edge of the flying carpet and climb on...",

        "description": "Big Mom launches her attack just as Sanji manages to grab the edge of Pudding\u0027s flying carpet. Together with Charlotte Chiffon, the three escaped the Empress\u0027 fury. On the ground, Luffy and his companions are still stunned by Big Mom\u0027s sudden attack, but they pull themselves together and race back to Sunny. However, in the sky, Pudding notices the pirates have taken a wrong turn and warns them. She even offers to guide them to the shore where their ship is moored. Luffy is pleased to have such help, but is quickly disheartened when he sees the trees of the Forest of Temptation blocking their path. Pudding helps them again, using his power to erase the homies\u0027 memories and implant them with the memories of the soul they had when it still possessed its own body. Some of the trees then think they have a job to do and are no longer under Big Mom\u0027s control. Sanji thanks Pudding for doing this. The young woman is astonished by his presence on her flying carpet and is embarrassed to the point of blushing violently, much to the astonishment of her sister Chiffon.\nHaving reached the forest\u0027s exit, Rabian picks up speed and flies off in the direction of Cocoa Island. As they leave Tougato, Sanji, Pudding and Chiffon fly over the Sunny and see Chopper and Brook fighting with soldiers on the deck of the ship. The two Straw Hats have defeated all their enemies except Perospero and Katakuri, who watch them motionless. The Straw Hat crew\u0027s cook is eager to lend his friends a hand, but he has a mission to fulfil. He already has in mind what kind of cake will knock out Big Mom!\n\nMeanwhile, Chopper and Brook get rid of the Chess sodats and some human mercenaries occupying their boat. Combining their forces, they manage to throw them into the water, but they can\u0027t defeat them all. Reinforcements arrive via a mirror in Nami and Robin\u0027s room. Chopper decides to destroy it so that their enemies can no longer come to Sunny from Mirror World. He and Brook apologize to Nami when she returns. On hearing this, Perospero mocks them by telling them that their friends had all died in the horrible explosion that ransacked the Tempting Forest, but the two pirates don\u0027t believe him. The eldest son of the Charlotte family then ordered them to surrender, as resistance was now pointless. But Brook and Chopper don\u0027t give up, and continue to fight valiantly. The living skeleton even attacks Perospero directly, promising to kill him with his own hands.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Tempting Forest, Big Mom, still clamoring for her wedding cake, continues to pursue the Straw Hats as they race towards their ship. They see the end of the forest as the Empress shouts that she\u0027ll do anything to stop them. Behind her, Prometheus sternly berates Zeus for having played into their enemies\u0027 hands and daring to strike their mistress down. In his defense, Zeus retorts that it wasn\u0027t his fault, as he was under the spell of Nami\u0027s delicious electric knots. For her part, blinded by stubborn hunger, Big Mom launches a third attack with her sword. The power of the blast forces the fugitives to take cover to avoid injury.\n\nBut the Empress wasn\u0027t done with them yet. She launched a new attack that swept away everything in its path, decimating a large number of Homies trees. Mad with rage, she quickened her pace and reached the pirates, threatening them with her sword while continuing to demand cake. Seeing that her technique wasn\u0027t working, she called Prometheus to the rescue. He throws a fireball at the pirates, who narrowly avoid it but damage a large part of the Tempting Forest.\n\nOn the deck of the Sunny, Brook starts a duel with Perospero, who proves to be a formidable adversary. Chopper decides to lend his friend a hand, but finds himself entangled in Perospero\u0027s candy. He can\u0027t move, and neither can Brook. The two pirates are now at the mercy of Big Mom\u0027s eldest son. The little reindeer discovers, to his horror, that he\u0027s completely covered in goo and that he\u0027ll be asphyxiated in three minutes before his friend\u0027s helpless eyes! Brook yells at their assailant to stop, but he continues to torture Chopper in an attempt to turn him into a giant candy. Brook also suffers the same fate under Perospero\u0027s satisfied gaze.\n\nSuddenly, a thunderous noise from the Tempting Forest interrupts Charlotte Katakuri\u0027s nap. The latter informs his brother of the imminent arrival of their mother, who is still suffering from her deadly hunger pangs. Perospero is in a hurry to get Big Mom to Cocoa Island, where she can enjoy her substitute wedding cake, otherwise the eldest son of the Charlotte Family will suffer the wrath of his mother. The latter launches a final attack with her sword, and Perospero is surprised to see the group of fugitives, led by the Straw Hat himself, emerge from the forest! Perospero froze in amazement, while Katakuri remained impassive, thinking that it was his own men who had been struck by lightning. For his part, Luffy is pleased to see his ship back at last, but is surprised to see Big Mom\u0027s troops occupying the Sunny. He also spots Brook and Chopper on the quarterdeck, transformed into giant candy canes.\n\nFor his part, Katakuri is delighted by what he sees, then orders his men to return to Mirror World, where he will personally deal with the pirates. All obey in a hurry, while the Straw Hats approach the ship, still pursued by Big Mom. Jinbei recognizes the two members of the Charlotte Family and warns Luffy that the disaster continues. For his part, Perospero is impressed by the spirited pirates and tells them that the place they\u0027ve just arrived at will be their graveyard. To stop them, he erects a huge wall of candy, which he calls \u0022Candy Maiden\u0022. It has sharp teeth that attack Luffy\u0027s group. Unimpressed, Luffy, Jinbei and Pedro combine their attack techniques to bring down the wall, much to Nami\u0027s delight. But Perospero has not said his last word. He rebuilds his wall of sweets, which rises menacingly above the pirates. With a flick of his spear, he orders his creature to hurl its sharp teeth at Luffy and his companions, who narrowly avoid them. As Jinbei urges caution in avoiding this obstacle, Luffy runs straight ahead and pulverizes the candy wall using the \u0022Red Hawk\u0022. Pedro is impressed by this fighting technique, while the Straw Hat is ready to do anything to take back his ship...",

        "title": "Before dawn! Pedron, captain of the guardians!",
        "description": "Employing all his power, Luffy pulverized the wall erected by Charlotte Perospero before the stunned eyes of Pedro and his friends. But the Straw Hat\u0027s punch is brutally stopped by Charlotte Katakuri, who had also thrown a punch enveloped in Haki. The two pirates face each other, impassive, staring at the lightning bolts emanating from their attacks. Pedro, witnessing the scene, recalled a conversation he\u0027d had in Zou with his master Nekomamushi, who had told him that the dawn of this world was fast approaching. The Leopard Mink takes a long look at the duel between Luffy and Katakuri. Katakuri soon had the upper hand in the fight, and the Straw Hat temporarily lowered his guard in the face of this formidable adversary.\nJust as his companions are about to board the Sunny, Big Mom arrives on shore, threatening the pirates with her sword and demanding her wedding cake. The Straw Hats take fright as they realize they are surrounded. However, Jinbei doesn\u0027t give up and advises them to get rid of Katakuri so that they can retake the boat and weigh anchor. The Straw Hat accepts his friend\u0027s plan and runs to confront his enemy. Following Luffy closely, Pedro remembers the words of Gol D. Roger\u0027s words: \u0022Listen! Everyone deserves his moment of glory.\u0022 For his part, Luffy, having activated his Weapon\u0027s Haki, attacks Katakuri head-on, who doesn\u0027t move an inch. Quite the opposite, in fact, as he knows that Luffy\u0027s punches have no effect on him. As for Perospero, he reaches the shore on a little candy raft he\u0027s just created.\n\nAt the same time, with Jinbei\u0027s help, Nami makes it safely to the forecastle, where she discovers Brook and Chopper transformed into giant candies. Meanwhile, Pedro and Carrot are still being pursued by Big Mom. They stop running to confront her. Before engaging in battle with the Empress, Pedro tells his friend that he believes Luffy and his friends are the ones the Kozuki Clan have been waiting for for centuries, the ones who will bring a new dawn to the world. Meanwhile, Perospero asks Charlotte Mont d\u0027Or by snail phone to surround the southwest coast with warships. The 19th son of the Charlotte family understands that the Straw Hats are still alive, much to Baron Tamago\u0027s astonishment. For her part, Nami explains to Jinbe what the burst stroke is and urges him to do it, as it would prevent the Sunny from being sunk as it weighed anchor.\n\nAt the same time, Big Mom arrives near the Sunny. Pedro and Carrot face her, ready to fight. The Mink orders his friend to join their companions, while he takes care of the Empress alone. Carrot obeys, while Big Mom continues to approach, convinced that the wedding cake is inside the ship. For his part, Jinbei pulls up the anchor while asking the statuesque Brook and Chopper to wake up! Suddenly, the Fishman notices that several Pies are facing them, and on one of them, Amande is overseeing the whole operation. She orders them to open fire, and the Sunny suffers a hail of cannonballs that fortunately don\u0027t reach her. While Carrot lends Nami a hand in bringing several barrels of cola for the Burst Blast, Luffy continues to attack Katakuri without the slightest success. Suddenly, he grabs her by the arm and delivers a blistering Haki-soaked punch that nails Luffy to the spot. For his part, Perospero immobilizes Sunny by engulfing him in a pool of candy. On deck, Nami observes this prodigy and realizes that she won\u0027t be able to use the Burst Blow to escape. She expresses her dismay to Carrot, who has joined her, while several Tarts arrive at their position.\n\nCaught between Big Mom and the enemy ships, the pirates are about to be defeated, much to Perospero\u0027s delight. However, Pedro has not said his last word. Without warning, he violently attacks the eldest son of the Charlotte family, who turns out to be an accomplished fencer. In fact, he easily overcame Pedro, telling him that it would be difficult for him to defeat him because a 700 million berry bounty was promised on his head. Pedro then recalls his previous interview with Perospero, after sacrificing his left eye and 50 years of his life expectancy. He was handcuffed and at the mercy of his enemy. Perospero was escorting him out of Totto Land and wanted to know how much longer his prisoner could live. The latter replied that he at least wanted to choose where to die. Impressed by his composure, Perospero asked him if he was indeed the captain of the Pirates of Nox and that the word \u0022Nox\u0022 referred to the night. Pedro contradicted him, telling him that the word simply meant that after night would come dawn, because every night has an end. Indeed, the Mink remembered that when he was a child, Gol D. Roger\u0027s ship, the Oro Jackson, had arrived in Zou. Roger had arrived in Zou. He also remembered his desire to join his crew, but Roger politely declined, telling him he was too young and that everyone deserves their moment of glory. Later, Wanda, who was also a child, gravely announced Roger\u0027s death to Pedro. He couldn\u0027t believe it, but it was true. With the execution of the King of Pirates, a new era of piracy had dawned, driving many adventurers in search of One Piece, Roger\u0027s priceless treasure. For his part, young Pedro pondered the words of the King of Pirates, thinking that past wishes, the course of time and dreams will never end, for as long as people continue to search for the meaning of freedom, these things will never come to an end. Convinced by these words, Pedro decides to take to the sea himself one day.\n\nBack to the present. Perospero boasts to Pedro that he will never see the dawn he had so long hoped for. Pedro contradicted him by grabbing his foot and showing him the sticks of dynamite he had hidden under his jacket. The Mink was ready to detonate them if Perospero didn\u0027t deliver the Straw Hats and their ship with his magic. Fearing for his life, Perospero tried to free himself, but the Mink held his foot firmly and prevented him from fleeing. He hits him with his stick to free himself, but to no avail. Carrot, who witnesses the scene, remembers his friend\u0027s last words. He had told her that he felt he was making his last journey, and the Mink understood his words when she saw his friend light the sticks of dynamite with his cigarette. A huge explosion occurred, pulverizing Pedro, Perospero and everything else on shore. Shaking Big Mom violently, the force of the explosion freed Sunny from her candy prison and as the ship set sail again, Carrot remembered Pedro\u0027s words about how important it was to save Luffy and his friends and help them escape Tougato Island. Understanding her sacrifice, Carrot howled her sadness over the raging waves as she remembered her friend\u0027s very last words: \u0022You must keep moving forward\u0022...",

        "description": "All aboard the Sunny are shocked by Pedro\u0027s sacrifice: to save them, he detonated the sticks of dynamite he was carrying. Overwhelmed by the pain of losing a loved one, Luffy and his companions stubbornly stare at the coast. For his part, Katakuri is saddened by the death of his older brother Perospero, while Big Mom is swept away like a piece of straw by the power of the explosion. No longer subject to the magic of Pero Pero no Mi, Brook and Chopper free themselves from their candy prison, much to everyone\u0027s relief. They watch in amazement as the boat rises above the waves and the candy begins to dissolve as if by magic. Jinbei is still in shock after Pedro\u0027s disappearance and wonders why he did it. For her part, Carrot, overcome with grief, wants to throw herself into the sea to find her friend, but she is held tightly by Nami, who doesn\u0027t want to lose her too.\nNoticing that the Sunny was no longer immobilized, Luffy asks Nami to activate the Burst Blast, while the young sailor inquires about Brook and Chopper\u0027s health. She is reassured to discover that they are fine. For his part, the Straw Hat doesn\u0027t want to consider Pedro\u0027s death in vain and decides to leave Tougato as soon as possible, but he still has a lot to do with Katakuri. When she sees him, Carrot pounces on him, drunk with rage. As she attacked him, Carrot remembered her fencing lessons with Sicilion on Zou. He was a demanding teacher who didn\u0027t appreciate incompetence and who pushed his pupils to give their best. Carrot had a bitter experience of this, but was saved by Pedro, who told Sicilion that his disciple really wasn\u0027t cut out for swordsmanship. He decided to take Carrot under his wing and teach her how to fight without a sword, but using electro and its constant presence in the air. Pedro was so good at teaching Carrot that he told her she\u0027d have her moment of glory too.\n\nBack to the present. Carrot fights fiercely against Katakuri, but she\u0027s no match for him. Big Mom\u0027s son promises his enemies that when he\u0027s alive, he won\u0027t let them go. Carrot is still upset by Pedro\u0027s death, but blames herself for not living up to his expectations. For his part, Luffy is beside himself when he sees Katakuri attacking his friend. He launches an attack, and a fierce battle ensues between Luffy and Katakuri. However, the young pirate\u0027s violent Haki-covered punches have no effect on his opponent. Luffy uses his Elephant Gun to immobilize Katakuri, while Nami uses the Burst Kick to send Sunny flying.\n\nOffshore, the ships commanded by Amande set to work, aiming their cannons at the Sunny. For his part, Brook lassoes the Shark Submerge III to take her with the Sunny at the moment of the Burst Blow. Chopper lends him a helping hand, while Big Mom has risen to her feet, increasingly drunk with anger. Seeing her, the two friends become frightened. Jinbei helps them secure the submarine to the ship, while Nami continues to activate the Burst Blast, which is about to sound. But Amande orders her men to aim their cannons at the bow of the Straw Hat ship and fires. The cannonballs don\u0027t damage the Sunny, but the situation worsens. Luffy, finding it hard to hold back Katakuri, asks his friend if everything is ready. She replies in the affirmative. But just as Sunny takes off, he is violently held back by Big Mom! Nami tries the Burst Kick again, but nothing works.\n\nMeanwhile, Amande orders her gunners to fire more cannonballs at the Sunny. Brook, Chopper and Jinbei spot them and rush to neutralize them before they reach their ship. Fishman isn\u0027t so lucky, as he has to take Nami\u0027s place while she refills the cola. To help her friend, she leaves him an audio recording of Franky explaining how the Sunny works. Meanwhile, Amande orders another attack from her gunners. The cannonballs fly towards their target. Brook and Chopper stand by to intercept them, while Nami loads the cola barrels alone. For his part, Jinbei listens carefully to Franky\u0027s instructions and pulls the lever to reactivate the Burst Blast. But Big Mom is still there and starts to destroy the Sunny by attacking her rail with her teeth! Luffy is furious at the sight, but still has to hold back Katakuri. Suddenly, Katakuri has a premonition and soon the Straw Hat sees Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e emerge from a mirror! While Nami comforts Carrot, Big Mom shakes the boat, causing fear in both friends. Suddenly, they see a shadow appear in the smoke and think it\u0027s Pedro. In fact, it\u0027s Perospero, who came out of the explosion alive but with serious injuries: his right arm was torn off and his candy armor shattered. He watches his mother ransack the Sunny, cursing Pedro.\n\nOn the deck of the Thousand Sunny, Luffy grabs Br\u00fbl\u00e9e\u0027s head while continuing to hold Katakuri. He calls out to his friends as Amande\u0027s ships prepare for a third attack. The Straw Hat promises to return. Soon, the filling of the cola barrels is complete, allowing a new Burst Kick to be activated. Jinbei does so at once, while his friends cling to the boat as best they can. The Sunny suddenly flies off without Big Mom\u0027s help, taking the Shark Submerge III with it. Amande and her men can\u0027t believe their eyes, yet their enemies have escaped!\n\nAs the Sunny gathers speed, Nami notices that Luffy has disappeared, along with Katakuri and Br\u00fbl\u00e9e. She then realizes that her friend has gone with them to the Mirror World. Indeed, the unexpected arrival of the Straw Hat causes panic among Big Mom\u0027s soldiers. But Katakuri doesn\u0027t care, because he\u0027s not afraid of his adversary. The latter is delighted to find himself in this place, where he can fight as much as he likes, and breaks the mirror through which he arrived, destroying the only passageway to the boat before the bewildered eyes of his enemies. Katakuri is astonished by Luffy\u0027s determination, but he knows that the young boy is no match for him. However, the Straw Hat is not impressed, and swears that he will return to the Sunny after defeating him...",

        "description": "In the Mirror World, Luffy proudly stands up to Charlotte Katakuri\u0027s men, who mock him for daring to take on the chief. But the young pirate doesn\u0027t care, as he has every intention of defeating the powerful sugar general. However, the latter doesn\u0027t underestimate the Straw Hat\u0027s talents, as he managed to spoil Big Mom\u0027s wedding ceremony. Knowing this, Katakuri can\u0027t let Luffy get away, as he would continue to harm his mother, especially as his opponent, though very bold, is inferior to him in power. Luffy, aroused by anger, tries to show him otherwise and attacks him without warning. Katakuri easily dodges all his blows under the astonished gaze of his men.\nMeanwhile, Sunny lands heavily far from Tougato Island after taking advantage of the Burst Blow. Brook checks that no one is following them, while Nami notices a heavy black cloud in the distance, heralding rain. On board, Chopper is desperately searching for Luffy and notices that the mirror giving access to Mirror World is broken. Carrot, still saddened by the death of her friend, reveals that the young pirate has gone to the Mirror World, taking Katakuri with him. This news alarmed all his friends, who feared that Luffy had no chance of winning against his adversary. However, their captain confirmed that he would be back. Betting on his optimism, Brook is surprised by Pedro\u0027s absence, as is Chopper. They still don\u0027t know that the Leopard Mink had sacrificed himself to help his friends escape. At the mention of his name, Carrot can\u0027t help crying. Stunned by his reaction, Brook and Chopper ask him what happened. Carrot doesn\u0027t have the strength to answer, so Nami tells them the sad news as a heavy rain falls on Sunny. After listening to Nami, Brook and Chopper don\u0027t believe in the disappearance of Pedro, with whom they\u0027d had so many adventures. Suddenly, the living skeleton starts to take it out on itself, because it wasn\u0027t strong enough to protect Sunny as it would have liked. Soon, Brook, Chopper and Carrot are crying for Pedro, and their tears exasperate Jinbei, who puts the situation into perspective by saying that Pedro\u0027s loss is even more serious for their enemies. Brook harshly criticizes Jinbei\u0027s words and tells him it\u0027s easy for him to say that, as he didn\u0027t know Pedro for very long. To which the fish-man retorts that it was Pedro\u0027s last wish to keep moving forward. Luffy understood this and decided to do something to thwart Big Mom\u0027s plans by taking on the enemy alone. Besides, Big Mom\u0027s fleet could attack them at any moment, so they had to be on their guard.\n\nRoused by Jinbei\u0027s words, they all return to their senses and, guided by Nami, decide to head west to join Sanji at the rendezvous point on Cacao Island, following the plan drawn up by Pudding. Suddenly, Carrot sees dozens of ships facing them from the lookout. She also sees Big Mom, who seems to be walking on water! In fact, the Empress is riding a huge sea slug made of candy by Perospero. Perospero, who lost his right arm in the explosion, then complains about the absence of Zeus, usually in charge of transporting Big Mom out to sea. Before the horrified eyes of the Straw Hats, the eldest son of the Charlotte Family reshapes his amputated arm with candy. Little does he know that it will melt when he sips his usual afternoon cup of tea; and when he sees it, he\u0027ll be reminded of Pedro and his hatred of him and his friends.\n\nAt the same time, on the west coast of Whole Cake Island, Zeus and Prometheus discover that all their companions have left without them in pursuit of the pirates, while above the waves, Chiffon, Pudding and Sanji continue their journey to Cocoa Island on Rabian. During the journey, Chiffon explains to Sanji that his sister Laura was a master in the art of chocolate making, which is why she was appointed Minister Chocolate. But since her departure, the position has become vacant. Sanji is astonished at this, while Chiffon reveals that the only person who could fill this position is Pudding, who hides, embarrassed, under the folds of her flying carpet. Suddenly, on a ship, Pound sees his daughter Chiffon in the sky and waves to her, but she doesn\u0027t see him.\n\nOn the magic carpet, Chiffon forces his sister Pudding to come out of hiding, but the young woman refuses. Since she\u0027s still wearing her wedding dress, she doesn\u0027t want to sit next to Sanji for fear that people will see them and think they\u0027re newlyweds. But Chiffon retorts that she has nothing to fear. But this doesn\u0027t convince Pudding, whose mood and feelings continue to be altered. Soon they arrive in sight of Cocoa Island, and Sanji is ready to spring into action by making a big wedding cake for Big Mom.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Mirror World, the confrontation between Luffy and Katakuri continues before the bewildered eyes of Big Mom\u0027s soldiers, who can\u0027t understand why their leader is so easily attacked. Suddenly, the Straw Hat notices that his opponent is imitating his Gear Second and Gear Third techniques and proving to be much more powerful. Luffy is saddened by this experience and, exhausted, stands up to Katakuri. Katakuri reminds him that he is stronger than he is and that there is nothing he can do to defeat him. However, the Straw Hat has not said his last word and is ready to fight him again, competing in speed and agility. However, Luffy suffers yet another setback but refuses to give up, much to Katakuri\u0027s dismay. The Straw Hat then uses all his remaining strength to attempt a new duel with him...",

        "description": "The fight between Luffy and Charlotte Katakuri is fierce. The Straw Hat uses the Grizzly Magnum technique to take down his opponent, but to no avail as he mimics her exact fighting style. Luffy is soon defeated, much to the delight of Katakuri\u0027s soldiers, but he doesn\u0027t admit defeat.\nAt the same time, as they come within sight of Cocoa Island, Pudding handcuffs Chiffon\u0027s wrists to make everyone believe that she has succeeded in capturing his sister, the wife of Capone Bege, the man who openly betrayed Big Mom. However, Pudding can\u0027t hide her love for Sanji, who behaves so gallantly with her that she melts with happiness. Soon the little group arrive in Chocolate Town, where they are greeted by the locals, dazzled by her superb wedding dress. Little do they know that the young woman had hidden Sanji under Rabian\u0027s folds while presenting her captive sister. Charlotte Pudding gives the order for them to be taken to the island\u0027s Sweet Factory to make the cake for Big Mom. Escorted by Agent Chocolate, they learn that Whole Cake Island\u0027s thirty-one top chefs have been summoned to prepare the cake.\n\nMeanwhile, Katakuri is surprised to receive a phone call from his brother Perospero, whom he thought had died in the explosion. Perospero tells him that the rest of the Straw Hat Crew have managed to escape despite the blockade set up by the Charlotte Family, but that they have found their way back. At the moment, Big Mom is hunting them down in person. For her part, Katakuri tells her that Luffy is now at her mercy.\n\nPudding and her \u0022prisoner\u0022 arrive at the Sweet Factory, where they are greeted by Whole Cake Island\u0027s thirty-one top chefs, nicknamed \u0022WCI: 31\u0022, who introduce themselves to the holder of Memo Memo no Mi. The latter explains that she needs their help to bake a wedding cake for Big Mom, or she\u0027ll destroy everything in her path. The chefs agree to help, much to the delight of Chocolate Town\u0027s inhabitants. Big Mom\u0027s 35th daughter asks the islanders not to disrupt the chefs\u0027 work while they make it for their country. Agent Chocolate, in the lead, accepts this request without question.\n\nOnce inside the factory and having manipulated each chef\u0027s memory using Pudding\u0027s power, Sanji emerges from his hiding place as Chiffon frees himself from his handcuffs. He shows her the sketch of a cake he had drawn on the way to Cocoa Island. Capone Bege\u0027s wife is blown away by the artistic talents of the young cook, who had written down the ingredients that made up the first cake, recognizing them by smell alone! Meanwhile, Pudding has swapped her wedding dress for a chef\u0027s smock. This new outfit has Sanji on the edge of his seat, and he\u0027s more and more taken with the young woman. The latter is also in a tizzy, but she has to pull herself together. She makes all the chefs believe that she is married to Sanji, then explains that she has rewritten each chef\u0027s memory so that they can help her design the new wedding cake. The members of WCI:31 are amazed at the precision of Sanji\u0027s sketch and ask for their assistance in making the cake. Convinced that the first cake had been destroyed by rain and that Pudding and Sanji were husband and wife, the chefs are impressed by Sanji\u0027s professionalism. Sanji orders them to gather all the ingredients and asks Pudding to make the chocolate topping and Chiffon the sponge cake. He also tells them that he will add a secret ingredient that will make Big Mom succumb, but they only have two hours and forty minutes to make the cake!\n\nAt the same time, in the Mirror Word, Luffy regains consciousness and sees above him Katakuri in deep conversation with Perospero. Perospero calls out to the Straw Hat, telling him that he\u0027s still alive and that Pedro\u0027s sacrifice was for nothing. After he hangs up, Katakuri orders Br\u00fbl\u00e9e to send soldiers to the Sunny to destroy the ship. But his sister freezes in horror when he sees Luffy standing behind his brother, ready to continue the fight. Indeed, the Straw Hat goes on the attack again, using \u0022Elephant Gatling\u0022. However, his opponent can imitate his techniques, as his power is similar to Gomu Gomu no Mi. Stubborn Luffy attacks again, but is no match for Katakuri, who is faster and more agile than he is. Soon, he\u0027s using the young pirate\u0027s fighting techniques to beat him, strafing him with dozens of Haki-soaked fists. At the end of his rope, Luffy manages to get up, taking a few steps before crashing face-first into the ground. Katakuri takes advantage of this moment to again ask Br\u00fbl\u00e9e to send soldiers to bor du Sunny. Mascarpone and Joscarpone volunteer for this mission, having found a mirror that gives access to the interior of the Straw Hat ship. They even offer to shoot flaming arrows into it. Their idea is approved by Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, but Luffy tries to break the mirror with a kick. He is stopped by Katakuri, who tells him that their duel is not over. Powerless, the Straw Hat sees Mascarpone and Joscarpone ignite the tips of their arrows, then bend their bows to aim at the mirror that Br\u00fbl\u00e9e is happily holding...",

        "description": "To the sarcastic laughter of Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, Joscarpone and Mascarpone bend their bows to shoot flaming arrows through a mirror to set the Sunny ablaze. Luffy tries to stop them, but is prevented by Katakuri, who tells him to leave his siblings alone. The Straw Hat tries to break the mirror giving access to his ship, but misses. Powerless, he sees Joscarpone and Mascarpone firing their arrows, and soon fire breaks out aboard the Sunny! Luffy is furious and sees Joscarpone and Mascarpone preparing new flaming arrows. He tries to stop them, but Katakuri stands in front of him. Suddenly, the Straw Hat sees a piece of mirror on the ground. He picks it up just as Katakuri attacks him with his fists. Luffy narrowly avoids them and takes advantage of this moment to try to communicate with his friends, without the slightest success. In fact, they are being chased by Big Mom, who walks on water thanks to the candy raft Perospero had made for her to track down the Straw Hats. All around her, ships under Amande\u0027s command are firing cannonballs in Sunny\u0027s direction. Jinbei, encouraged by his companions, struggles to avoid them. However, his helming skills work wonders, as the Fishman manages to dodge all the projectiles. For his part, Chopper lends Jinbei a hand and manages to send the cannonballs back to their senders! Brook then takes over, slicing through the cannonballs which explode on contact with his sword.\nDespite the noise of the cannonade, Nami, who is on deck with Carrot, suddenly hears Luffy\u0027s voice. He asks her to break all the ship\u0027s mirrors, as the Sunny is in great danger. On Br\u00fbl\u00e9e\u0027s orders, Joscarpone and Mascarpone have fired new arrows, and a major fire is ravaging the interior of the Straw Hat ship. Brook witnesses the incident and alarms his friends, who realize that the arrows setting their ship on fire came from a mirror. While Brook tries to extinguish the fire with water jumps, Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, Joscarpone and Mascarpone laugh and send more arrows. Luffy tries to stop them, but is held back by Katakuri, who is still blocking his path. In the struggle, the Straw Hat loses his piece of mirror, while Nami is worried about not hearing from her friend. He is immobilized by Katakuri\u0027s foot, much to the delight of Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, who gets her revenge. For his part, Luffy orders them to stop.\n\nMeanwhile, time is running out on Cacao Island. Sanji coordinates all the island\u0027s cooks to make Big Mom\u0027s new wedding cake. With the help of Chiffon and Pudding, he wages a veritable battle against time. Sanji shows everyone his culinary talents by cutting up a bunch of bananas with disconcerting speed, before Pudding\u0027s conquered eyes. But the pastry chefs face a major problem: their butter supply is running low. However, this does not disarm Sanji, who orders them to continue making the cake, even though this problem could change its taste! What\u0027s more, the cook from the Chapeau de Paille crew has come up with a solution: use prune pur\u00e9e as a substitute, adding baking powder and reducing the amount of sugar to compensate for the lack of butter. Everyone gets to work, much to the pride of Pudding, who is increasingly in love with Sanji. What\u0027s more, the cooks on Cacao Island mistake Pudding and Sanji for newlyweds, a situation that still captures the young woman\u0027s heart. But Chiffon keeps his feet on the ground and orders everyone to get back to work without further delay.\n\nAt the same time, in the Mirror World, Luffy is still battling with Katakuri. Katakuri is holding him at his mercy, trying to suffocate him with his foot pressed against his chest. Nami tries unsuccessfully to contact her friend, while Br\u00fbl\u00e9e sneers. She orders her men to enter Sunny. Luffy, drunk with anger, refuses and temporarily frees himself from Katakuri\u0027s grip. He orders Nami to smash all the ship\u0027s mirrors, as their enemies are on their way to attack them, while he personally deals with Katakuri. However, a more serious problem awaits the Sunny\u0027s occupants. A monstrous wave, complete with eyes and mouth, is threatening to descend on their ship. And above this wave stands Big Mom, who had injected part of her soul. The wave is about to hit the Sunny and Nami tells Luffy, with a heavy heart, that they\u0027re doomed.\n\nThe huge wave is about to engulf the Sunny and its occupants. They don\u0027t have enough cola to make another Burst. However, Jinbei may have found a way to get his friends out of this predicament, while Perospero tries to calm his mother\u0027s nerves by asking her not to sink their enemies\u0027 ship, otherwise the wedding cake inside will be lost forever. At the same time, Jinbei is supervising a maneuver to \u0022enter the green room\u0022. Brook and Chopper believe this to be paradise. Specifically, they set a sail and Jinbei changes Sunny\u0027s course completely, guiding her into the wave: this U-turn takes them into the wave\u0027s convolution. Jinbe explains that this is the green room, a small space created in the crest of a wave, where the fish-men children usually love to play. In the end, the wave has finished rolling in and Sunny emerges just in time. For his part, Perospero, like Big Mom, thinks that their enemies have sunk and reports this good news to Katakuri; this only adds to Luffy\u0027s concern, as he can no longer reach Nami.\n\nAt the same time, Br\u00fbl\u00e9e orders her men to cancel the Sunny\u0027s escape plan, as it has sunk. However, Joscarpone and Mascarpone show her the reflection of a mirror, which astonishingly shows that the Sunny had not sunk. On the other side, Nami smashes the mirror. Brook is taken aback, fearing that Luffy won\u0027t be able to return to them. Nami reveals that she is following her captain\u0027s orders, then orders her companions to break all the mirrors on the Sunny. By doing so, their enemies will no longer be able to attack them and Luffy will have a free hand. He already knows what he\u0027s going to do: continue his duel with Katakuri...",

Meanwhile, Joscarpone and Mascarpone, urged on by Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, prepare to fire their flaming arrows at a mirror. They fire, but just as the arrows reach their target, the mirror explodes before Br\u00fbl\u00e9e\u0027s bewildered eyes. Indeed, Carrot, following Nami\u0027s orders, had broken the mirror.

Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e realizes that her enemies are still alive, while Luffy receives a call from Chopper via his piece of mirror. The little reindeer asks his friend to speak privately. The Straw Hat complies and runs away from his adversaries to learn of Jinbei\u0027s latest feat, when he managed to save the Sunny from a huge tsunami using a Fish-Men technique. For his part, Brook explains that they had to break all the Sunny\u0027s mirrors to prevent their enemies from entering their ship. However, Luffy won\u0027t be able to get in either. The Straw Hat is aware of this as he receives a call from Nami. She asks him if he has a plan to join them, but Luffy tells her he doesn\u0027t know. She tells him that they\u0027ll arrive at Cacao Island - where Sanji is - in ten hours, at around 1 a.m., and that Luffy will have to reach Cacao Island via a mirror once he\u0027s beaten Katakuri. But Katakuri violently cuts off communication after immobilizing the Straw Hat in mochi. Once again at his mercy, Luffy becomes Katakuri\u0027s plaything, shamelessly beating him and sending him crashing into a wall of the Mirror World. The Sweet Commander isn\u0027t done with him yet, however, as he attacks again, transforming his leg into a special type of mochi that comes crashing down on Luffy!\nThe Straw Hat manages to dodge the blow and flees on all fours. He is then pursued by his opponent, who uses the \u0022Willow Mochi\u0022 to eliminate him. Luffy manages to avoid his blows and runs for his life. But he is still pursued by Katakuri, who manages to catch him. He hammers him with his feet, but Luffy holds on. Despite his enemy\u0027s blows, he manages to reconnect with his friends thanks to pieces of mirror scattered in front of him. Despite his wounds, he tries to smile and asks his friends to get moving, as he\u0027s only slowing them down. He assures them that he will defeat Katakuri. This lie convinces Nami, Brook, Carrot and Chopper, but not Jinbei, who remains doubtful. As everyone sets course for Cacao Island, Luffy stands up and faces Katakuri. The latter, aware of his adversary\u0027s every move, pulls a trident from his arm and brandishes it in Luffy\u0027s direction, provoking him with the Straw Hat\u0027s own words: \u0022I have no intention of dying here\u0022.\n\nMeanwhile, in Sweet City, everyone is repairing the damage to their town. For his part, Charlotte Mont d\u0027Or is absorbed in his occupations while Baron Tamago chats with him. Big Mom\u0027s son assures him that they will defeat their opponents. Meanwhile, in the Kingdom of Germa, the Empress\u0027s troops are held in check by the Vinsmoke Family, while in Mirror World, Luffy stands face to face with Katakuri. Katakuri assures him that he will soon die. Le Chapeau de Paille is then taunted by Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, who praises the exploits of her brother, whom she describes as superhuman. Katakuri is said to have been born standing up, never changing position except to sit and sleep. Nor would he have touched the ground, as he abhors it. Disproportionate flattery about Katakuri\u0027s qualities follows. Luffy silences Br\u00fbl\u00e9e by throwing a punch. This is stopped by Katakuri, who warns the Straw Hat to stop attacking his little sister. He then hits her with several blows, including one called \u0022Mochi Trust\u0022, using his trident christened \u0022Mogura\u0022. Luffy manages to dodge his blow, then valiantly confronts his opponent in a fierce fight. For her part, Br\u00fbl\u00e9e is jubilant, having overheard his conversation with the Straw Hats, and knows that they plan to meet up on Cacao Island. She reports this information by snail phone to Perospero, who is sitting comfortably on Big Mom\u0027s left shoulder. Family Charlotte\u0027s eldest son learns that his enemies survived the tsunami and are still alive. He advises his mother to get to Cacao Island as soon as possible, but Big Mom makes a detour to Nuts Island after being attracted by the smell.\n\nFar away, in the Mirror World, the battle between Katakuri and Luffy had resumed. The Straw Hat faced a formidable opponent, but managed to dodge all his attacks. However, he was no match for Katakuri\u0027s gift of premonition, which dealt him a crushing blow. Katakuri, brandishing his trident, swoops down on Luffy and warns him that he has no future in this world...",

        "description": "Luffy narrowly escapes another attack from Katakuri, who wields his trident with dexterity. The Straw Hat tries to retaliate, but his attack is stopped by his opponent, who inflicts a stinging beating. However, Luffy doesn\u0027t want to leave it at that, but struggles to dodge Katakuri\u0027s multiple offensives. Katakuri is furious at not being able to defeat him, despite his gift of premonition. However, all Luffy\u0027s attacks are countered by Katakuri, who is getting fed up with his opponent. Big Mom\u0027s son manages to immobilize him and uses his trident to finish him off. But Luffy\u0027s determination was not enough, and he managed to escape this new lethal attack. He even boasts that he\u0027s managed to hit his weapon, a reflection that exasperates Katakuri more and more. Katakuri then gets down to business, awakening his Demon Fruit to turn the entire floor into mochi: the \u0022Flowing Mochi\u0022 attack. Luffy is instantly immobilized, at Katakuri\u0027s mercy, who can do as he pleases. However, the Straw Hat has not said his last word and activates his Gear Fourth just as his opponent had planned.\nMeanwhile, back in Sweet City, while Mont d\u0027Or is furiously wondering where Thousand Sunny is, Pekoms is crying his eyes out after learning of Pedro\u0027s disappearance. His crying disturbs Mont d\u0027Or, who orders him to be quiet immediately. For his part, Tamago returns to Pedro\u0027s death, saying that Pedro always wanted to die by blowing himself up. He goes on to say that he thinks they underestimated the Straw Hats, and Mont d\u0027Or weighs up this claim, saying that the collapse of the castle was just an accident; Tamago disagrees, saying that it was all part of the Straw Hats\u0027 plan. Mont d\u0027Or is furious about this.\n\nAt the same time, on the sea of Tottoland, Capone Bege is on his ship, the Nostra Castello, and orders his crew to set course for Cacao Island, where Chiffon is. But they are pursued by a fleet led by Charlotte Custard, Big Mom\u0027s sixth daughter. She strafes the mafia pirate\u0027s ship, but her shots miss. Suddenly, Bege orders a counter-attack and the Nostra Castello fires several cannonballs, damaging two enemy ships. Taking advantage of the confusion caused by this attack, the Pirates of the Fire Tank ship flees and manages to lose their pursuers. On her ship, Charlotte Custard broods over her rage, hoping that the sea slugs scattered around will provide her with the location of her enemies.\n\nNot far away, in the Kingdom of Germa, the battle rages between Big Mom\u0027s troops and members of the Vinsmoke Family. Soon, Mont d\u0027Or is contacted by a certain Nusstorte, who explains that he has succeeded in defeating all the Germa, but has not destroyed their cloning system. In reality, in the Kingdom of Germa, the Vinsmoke children have defeated all the troops of Big Mom\u0027s crew, and it\u0027s Niji who speaks into the snail phone, pretending to be Big Mom\u0027s 12th. He asks what happened to the Straw Hats. Mont d\u0027Or replied that they had gone out to sea on a westerly course, but that they would manage to capture them. After this snail call, Reiju is relieved to learn that Luffy and his friends are still alive. For his part, Ichiji orders his brothers and sister to prepare their boats for sailing.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Mirror Word, Luffy wants to break free from Katakuri\u0027s embrace and activates his Gear Fourth in front of his adversary. But Katakuri doesn\u0027t give him the time he needs and hits him with a full volley. Despite his advantage, Katakuri explains that he has no intention of seeing him activate his power, asserting that he would not underestimate him unlike his siblings. He then turns several Mirror World walls into mochi, which fall on Luffy in an attempt to suffocate him. Realizing that it took him a long time and a lot of trouble to beat him, Katakuri is 40 minutes late for the Merienda he\u0027s supposed to attend. He apologizes that their fight had to end this way, but congratulates him on having been a tough and annoying opponent...",

        "description": "Katakuri leaves Luffy to his fate and heads off to his rendezvous. He orders three pastry chefs to come at once with a cart full of cakes. They congratulate him on his swift victory over the Straw Hat. But Katakuri doesn\u0027t care about the compliments and wants to enjoy his snack immediately. However, one of the bakers points out that the tea they had brought was cold, an unforgivable fault for Big Mom\u0027s son. Big Mom\u0027s son confides that he likes iced tea too! Relieved, the pastry chefs proudly present him with their creations, inimitably flavored doughnuts that will delight Katakuri\u0027s delicate taste buds.\nWishing to enjoy these marvels in peace, Katakuri builds a temple-like house out of mochi and gluttonously feasts without a care for Luffy. The latter, before the bewildered eyes of the three pastry chefs, manages to eat his way out of the mountain of mochi while the chefs discuss Katakuri\u0027s power. Seeing the temple built by Katakuri, he ruins his snack despite the protests of the three pastry chefs, enraging the Sweet Commander to no end.\n\nMeanwhile, on Cacao Island, Sanji is supervising the cooks in his candy factory. He is helped by Chiffon and Pudding. Pudding is very jealous when she sees her sister presenting Sanji with a piece of sponge cake she has just made. Wishing to regain her composure, Pudding concentrates on her chocolate, much to the surprise of the cooks around her. Meanwhile, Charlotte Oven arrives within sight of the island and is aware that her younger sister is baking a cake in the candy factory.\n\nAt the same time, in Mirror World, Luffy\u0027s fists destroy the \u0022temple\u0022 built by Katakuri, who was quietly enjoying his doughnuts. He had pulled down his scarf and eaten his cakes using a powerful jaw with sharp teeth! But when the Straw Hat pulverized his house, the Sweet Commander was furious, for Luffy had had the audacity to see him eating, lying on the floor, a position he loathed to the utmost. However, the Straw Hat scoffs at his snack and points out that their fight wasn\u0027t over. At the mention of this word, the three pastry chefs took fright and ran off at full speed. But having seen Katakuri\u0027s true face, he kills them by piercing them with his trident to prevent them from divulging his secret.\n\nMad with rage, Katakuri starts a new fight against Luffy after realizing that he had underestimated his strength. But using his Weapon\u0027s Haki, he inflicts a searing pain on his opponent. Indeed, Luffy is no match for Katakuri. Katakuri strikes him shamelessly, telling him to stop believing that he could defeat him. Despite the pain, the Straw Hat holds his ground and even manages to hit Katakuri on the chin. Under the impact, his true face appears out of his scarf, frightening beyond belief: a horrible scar encircles a mouth endowed with powerful, sharp teeth! Believing that Luffy was boasting that he had finally managed to hit him, Katakuri attacks him again with ferocity, proclaiming that his abilities are far superior to his own. But each time he missed his target, as Luffy had noticed that his movements had become slower. With better concentration, the Straw Hat had even discovered how Katakuri\u0027s power worked. Katakuri laughed at his opponent as Luffy finally activated his Gear Fourth. In the form of the Boundman, Luffy once again confronts Katakuri in single combat after realizing that his enemy is not as invincible as he claimed. A fierce battle ensues between the two adversaries. Luffy, in a fit of fury, temporarily overcomes Katakuri by hitting him with the Kong Gun...",

        "description": "The confrontation between Luffy and Katakuri continues after the Straw Hat activates his Gear Fourth. Luffy uses the Kong Gun to deal a crushing blow to the Sweet Commander. Following this attack, the young pirate recalls how ineffective his Haki-coated blows were against Katakuri thanks to Rayleigh\u0027s teachings on the island of Ruskaina, whereas the use of this Haki would normally make any body reachable. The reason the Sweet Commander was dodging his blows was due to the use of his Observation Haki, which enabled him to anticipate each of his blows and thus deform himself. However, Luffy continued to pelt his opponent with blows, but the latter did not retaliate, recovering his composure and reusing his Observation Haki to dodge Luffy\u0027s attacks. This exchange of blows allows Katakuri to understand how Cracker could have been defeated by Luffy. Big Mom\u0027s son then uses his Fruit of the Demon, using the Peerless Donuts and Strength Mochi techniques to reach Luffy, who doesn\u0027t seem to react to the attack despite remaining in Gear Fourth.\nMeanwhile, on Cacao Island and more specifically in Chocolate Town, preparations for the wedding cake are well underway. Sanji, Pudding and Chiffon, with the help of Big Mom\u0027s best cooks, are busy delivering the cake on time. Suddenly, Pudding receives a snail phone call from Br\u00fbl\u00e9e asking if everything is going well at the candy factory. The young woman replies that everything is going swimmingly. Br\u00fbl\u00e9e continues the conversation, revealing that she knows Luffy\u0027s plan to return to Cacao Island after defeating Katakuri. Sanji and Chiffon also listen to these words and are petrified with fear. Suddenly, someone knocks violently on the factory door. It\u0027s Pound, who, driven by his fatherly desires, is desperate to see his daughter. He wants to talk to her, even for a moment. But he is prevented from doing so by the islanders, who urge him not to bother Charlotte Pudding during her creative period. Inside the factory, everyone carries on as if nothing had happened. As for Pudding, she continues to speak with her big sister Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, who tells her of the imminent arrival of the Chapeaux de Paille ship off Cacao Island at 1am. She also reveals that Luffy intends to go there, but she doesn\u0027t believe the Straw Hat will be able to get to Cocoa Island, as he has challenged his older brother Katakuri to a duel to the death. She has a front-row seat to the fight between the young pirate and Big Mom\u0027s beloved son, and will have no chance of triumphing over such an adversary. True, it\u0027s 4 p.m. and in nine hours the pirates\u0027 rendezvous will take place. But they won\u0027t see their captain coming, and they\u0027ll be hot on the heels of an angry Big Mom and a vengeful Perospero. To further guarantee the Charlotte Family\u0027s success, Pudding\u0027s older brother Oven is already on hand to welcome the Straw Hats should they have the audacity to arrive on Cacao Island a little early. This news terrifies Pudding. But Oven accepts his sister\u0027s wishes and does not enter the factory. However, he sees Pound and, overcome with anger, can\u0027t resist hitting him. Chiffon\u0027s father is stunned by this behavior and hears from Oven that Big Mom will soon be coming to the island. Since Oven knows that his mother can\u0027t stand her ex-husband, he decides to kidnap Pound to lessen Big Mom\u0027s anger.\n\nWhile Chiffon worries about the noise coming from outside, Sanji and Pudding have a chat after listening to Br\u00fbl\u00e9e\u0027s conversation. The young woman worries about Luffy, who is fighting one of Big Mom\u0027s strongest sons, while Sanji has every confidence that his friend will triumph over such a tough opponent as Katakuri. As he says these words, Luffy once again launches into the attack, vowing to win his battle against Katakuri...",

The latter, thanks to his gift of premonition, manages to counter the Straw Hat\u0027s lightning attack, then immobilizes him with mochi. He then inflicts a severe beating, but Luffy manages to break free of his bonds. He notices that his opponent has become very strong again. Undaunted, the young pirate pounces on Katakuri, who hits him back with blow after blow.\nAt the same time, on Cacao Island, Sanji believes in Luffy\u0027s strength and convinces Pudding to finish the cake intended for Big Mom. Not far away, on Nuts Island, Amande and her fleet set about evacuating the island\u0027s inhabitants, as Big Mom is on the verge of invading Nuts Island to annihilate it. Perospero tries to dissuade her, but to no avail. The Empress, believing she\u0027s dealing with her wedding cake, wrecks everything in her path, causing panic among the inhabitants.\n\nMeanwhile, in Sweet City, Charlotte Mont d\u0027Or receives a snail phone call from Charlotte Custard, who was chasing Capone Bege. She confesses to her brother that she has lost track of the Fire Tank pirates\u0027 ship. This news upsets Mont d\u0027Or, who makes no secret of his displeasure. He orders her to continue her search. He then orders one of his subordinates to check whether the sea slugs, which have been placed all over the territory, are working properly. For their part, Bege and his group continue on their way to Cacao Island, surprised that no enemy ships are pursuing them. Little do they know that Charlotte Praline, Aladdin\u0027s wife, is on their side, singing to attract all the sea slugs and neutralize their surveillance system. The same astonishment reigns aboard the Thousand Sunny, and Jinbei is at the helm to lead the Straw Hat ship to port.\n\nMont d\u0027Or learns from Perospero that Big Mom is destroying Nuts Island! To make matters worse, he also learns that all the sea slugs have strangely disappeared. In fact, this is the work of Charlotte Praline who, with the help of the Pirates of the Sun, has managed to coax all the sea slugs out of Big Mom\u0027s territory, leaving their allies free to go wherever they please, undetected.\n\nAt the same time, in the Mirror World, Luffy once again confronts Katakuri. The latter has regained his legendary calm and seems invulnerable. He even notices that his young adversary has shrunk. An important detail that forces Luffy to get away from Katakuri as quickly as possible, as he won\u0027t be able to use his Haki for ten minutes. This about-face surprised Katakuri, who began to pursue the young pirate, who had regained his normal form. Now defenseless, the Straw Hat has no choice but to flee and avoid being caught by his ruthless adversary. Running for his life, Luffy narrowly escapes death. Katakuri tries to eliminate him by throwing powerful punches. The Straw Hat manages to dodge them all, but stops running when he comes face to face with Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Then seeing mirrors all around him, he decides to use Katakuri\u0027s sister\u0027s power to get out of Mirror World. Alerted by Br\u00fbl\u00e9e\u0027s cries, Katakuri rushes off to rescue his sister, but narrowly misses the Straw Hat, who rushes off through a mirror with his precious hostage. Luffy and Br\u00fbl\u00e9e find themselves instantly transported to Nuts Island, under attack from Big Mom! Perospero and Amande try to reason with the Empress, but to no avail. She continues to destroy everything in her path, unaware that Luffy is nearby. He catches sight of Big Mom and freezes in fright.\n\nNot far away, on the Thousant Sunny, while Nami had changed her outfit, the Straw Hats scanned the horizon to see if anyone was following them. At the helm, Jinbei is on his guard, aware that Big Mom will do anything to preserve his reputation. Indeed, Mont d\u0027Or orders all his men to find the fugitives - the Straw Hats, the Fire Tank Pirates and the Sun Crew - and sink their ships in the depths of the ocean.\n\nIgnoring this danger, Sanji continues making Big Mom\u0027s wedding cake. One of his cooks falls over after tasting the whipped cream. His colleagues worry about his health, but discover that he\u0027s still alive. He\u0027s even fallen in ecstasy at Sanji\u0027s creation, and can\u0027t help telling his friends that he\u0027s never eaten such good whipped cream in his life! Simsim cream is the secret ingredient Sanji will use to create the Empress\u0027s cake. For her part, Chiffon finished her sponge cake at the same time as Pudding with her chocolate ganache, in which she placed Sanji\u0027s Simsim cream. The latter orders the cooks to load all these ingredients onto a boat, as he intends to finish the cake at sea and give it to his friends who will come to meet him. Sanji\u0027s only motivation now is to defeat, once and for all, Big Mom, who has terrorized his companions for too long...",

        "description": "After escaping from Mirror World with the help of Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, Luffy comes face-to-face with Big Mom, who is ravaging Nuts Island. The panicked inhabitants flee, much to the fear of Amande, the island\u0027s administrator. For his part, Perospero tries to reason with his mother, telling her that neither the wedding cake nor Luffy are on the island. Suddenly, the eldest son of the Charlotte family notices the presence of the Straw Hat and raises the alarm. Luffy doesn\u0027t understand why the Empress is on this island when she was supposed to be chasing the Sunny across the open sea. But the young pirate is on the run! Big Mom throws him the roof of a house, which Luffy manages to dodge, taking Br\u00fbl\u00e9e with him. Taking his precious hostage with him, the Straw Hat flees at full speed, while Big Mom runs after him to give him the wedding cake he had stolen.\nAs Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e cries out to be rescued, Perospero builds a wall of candy in front of the Straw Hat to free his sister. Activating Gear Third, Luffy tries to pulverize this obstacle with a devastating punch, but he can\u0027t do anything without Haki. For his part, Perospero savors the moment by encircling the Straw Hat with his candy wall, while Amande arrives to deliver the coup de gr\u00e2ce with her sword. Luffy manages to escape from his candy prison, still carrying his hostage. He must find a mirror as quickly as possible if he is to leave this nightmarish place, but he is once again pursued by Big Mom and Perospero. Luffy must do all he can to outrun them while he recovers his Haki.\n\nMeanwhile, on Cacao Island, preparations are well underway to ship the cake to Big Mom. Borrowing a cook\u0027s glasses and scarf, Sanji makes his way incognito from the island\u0027s chocolate factory to the port. He hopes to avoid being recognized by the locals thanks to this disguise. For his part, Pudding asks the citizens of Cacao Island, in admiration of the speed with which the cake was made, to clear the way to transport their preparation to the port. The population is relieved and grateful to the cooks. The chefs, whose memories have been altered by Pudding, wonder why Sanji dressed up. At the same time, Pound spots Chiffon in the distance when Oven stops the wagon carrying the cake. Pudding wants his brother to let them pass so he can finish decorating the cake on board the boat and give it to Big Mom on the open sea. Oven accepts his sister\u0027s plan, but violently attacks Chiffon. Despite Pudding\u0027s opposition and the astonishment of the entire population, Oven can\u0027t let someone who has conspired against Big Mom - even his sister - escape. For his part, Sanji wants to help his friend, but he can\u0027t compromise his identity at the risk of being captured too.\n\nNot far away, Big Mom continues to pursue Luffy, perched on the candy wall created by Perospero, causing panic among all the inhabitants of Nuts Island. Amande begs her big brother to do something, because she doesn\u0027t want to see the town she\u0027s in charge of destroyed by her mother. Perospero complies and tries his best to calm Big Mom down. But she doesn\u0027t listen to him and continues her work of devastation. For his part, Luffy has managed to lose his pursuers and is still trying to find a mirror that he can activate using Br\u00fbl\u00e9e\u0027s power. As he runs, the Straw Hat is astonished by Big Mom\u0027s presence on the island and realizes that his friends have managed to escape her. But in his haste, Luffy has dropped Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, who was hiding in a chest shaped like a giant peanut. Le Chapeau de Paille sets out to find her. He finally finds her, betrayed by her stupidity. Tying her up tightly to prevent her escaping, Luffy puts Br\u00fbl\u00e9e on his back and continues his mad dash to find a mirror. Luffy succeeds in his quest when he discovers a mirror in a house. Just as he was about to borrow it, the precious mirror shatters under the bullets of Charlotte Efire, the 5th daughter of the Charlotte Family. She fires another salvo at the Chapeau de Paille, who returns the bullets to their intended recipient before fleeing again, taking Br\u00fbl\u00e9e with her, who begs her big sister to come and save her. Efire pursues the Chapeau de Paille, who loses her by climbing onto the roof of a house.\n\nWhile searching for a mirror, Luffy comes face to face with Charlotte Mond\u00e9e, the 2nd daughter of the Charlotte Family, who stands in his way brandishing a large sword. Luffy has no choice but to turn back and try to escape. But he\u0027s soon overtaken by Monde, and Luffy has to flee the other way just in time before his pursuer slices through the roof. Finding himself back on the street, Luffy keeps running, wondering if he\u0027ll find a new mirror. But he is spotted by Big Mom and Perospero. The Empress brandishes her sword and launches a blistering attack on Luffy despite the pleas of her son, who had noticed that the Chapeau de Paillez had taken Br\u00fbl\u00e9e hostage.\n\nAt the same time, on Cacao Island, Sanji is wondering what he can do to save Chiffon. Suddenly, he saw Chiffon standing up at Oven\u0027s feet. Capone Bege\u0027s wife assures him that she has already made up her mind: her debt will not be repaid until Nami and the Straw Hats are safe, so she has decided to finish Big Mom\u0027s cake. Charlotte Oven remains adamant, however, and just as he is about to execute her with his fiery fist, Pound tries to save his daughter, who wonders who her savior is. For his part, Sanji, who still wishes to keep his identity secret so as not to compromise Pudding, decides to take action and help Pound. He delivers a lightning kick to Oven, who is thrown backwards onto a building. The Black Leg then grabs Chiffon and brings her safely back on the wagon to Pudding, who hides his sister under a large blanket.\n\nOven rises to his feet with a bruised neck and battered face, and although confused, quickly dispatches his ex-father-in-law with a furious punch, knowing that he was in no position to defeat him. Before he lost sight of the speeding wagon, Oven jumped aboard and set off in search of Chiffon. He soon spotted her hiding under a tarpaulin. He captures her despite Pudding\u0027s pleas that she needs her sister to finish the cake. For his part, Pound struggles to his feet and asks Oven to stop mistreating his daughter. Pudding continues to beg her brother to release Chiffon, but to no avail. Oven raises his fiery fist again and is about to kill his sister when he receives a snail phone call. One of his subordinates informs him that they have managed to locate Bege\u0027s ship, which is currently heading for Cacao Island. Oven is delighted by this news. Indeed, the Nostra Castello is sailing at full speed, pursued by a whole armada of Pie Ships that are bombarding it relentlessly. On board, Capone Bege praises his wife\u0027s courage and reassures his son. In front of his crew, he vows to do everything in his power to save Chiffon...",

        "description": "In extremis, Luffy manages to escape Big Mom\u0027s powerful attack by rushing through a mirror thanks to the power of Br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Now safely ensconced in Mirror World, the Straw Hat catches his breath. However, Luffy still has to wait if he wants to use his Haki again. But Br\u00fbl\u00e9e disagrees and screams to warn her brother of her presence. Katakuri hears her and runs to her rescue. For his part, Luffy gags her to keep her quiet, but the damage is already done: Katakuri has found her trail! Luffy has no choice but to flee, taking his cumbersome companion with him. Suddenly, he spots a mirror and rushes into it with Br\u00fbl\u00e9e just as Katakuri is about to catch him.\nAt the same time, off the coast of Cacao Island, the Tartes ships are relentlessly bombarding Capone Bege\u0027s ship, the Nostra Castello. Capone Bege calms his son, who is alarmed by the cannon fire, and reassures him that he will see his mother again very soon. For his part, Charlotte Oven has managed to capture Charlotte Chiffon, and is astonished to learn that Bege would undertake such a reckless rescue attempt to save his wife. Oven is satisfied with this turn of events, but remains deaf to Pudding\u0027s pleas to free their sister, as she needs her to finish the cake for Big Mom. In the shadows, Sanji, still in disguise, remains on the lookout. Soon, Oven orders one of his subordinates to switch on the loudspeakers to talk to Bege. He informs him that he has captured Chiffon and orders him to go ashore and make an uneventful trip to the port. He also reminds him that fighting would be pointless, as there are armed men waiting for him. Chiffon suddenly shouts at Bege to abandon her to her fate and escape, so that he can avenge her later, much to the dismay of the Fire Tank members. Hearing his wife\u0027s cries of pain, Bege accepts Oven\u0027s terms and decides to surrender when he reaches the port of Cocoa Island. Big Mom\u0027s forces move into position to lay siege to the Nostra Castello as it heads for Cocoa Island. However, Bege has not said his last word, even though his ship is surrounded by enemy vessels. Without warning, he takes aim at Oven\u0027s face with an explosive shot and the latter is thrown heavily from the wagon, while the Fire Tank pirates show their joy despite being surrounded by Big Mom\u0027s ships. Bege seems confident despite the many guns pointed at him. For his part, Oven rises to his feet and rages against his ex-brother-in-law.\n\nMeanwhile, the Straw Hats aboard the Thousand Sunny realize that Big Mom\u0027s forces have caught up with them. Jinbei tells his comrades that they have no choice but to fight. Chopper hurries to inform Carrot of the situation. He finds her at the top of the tall mast, scanning the sky. The young Mink asks him if the full moon will appear tonight.\n\nOn Cacao Island, Oven is ready to do battle with Bege, for whom he has a bitter hatred. Activating his power, he marches towards the harbor while his rival\u0027s ship continues to move towards the island. Bege is determined to fight and orders his men to accelerate the speed of the Nostra Castello. Before the astonished eyes of their enemies, the pirate ship hurtles towards the shore with speed, showing no sign of slowing down. On the contrary, Bege\u0027s ship continues to advance, and everyone assumes he will perish in this desperate act. But the opposite is true. In fact, the Nostra Castello is an amphibious ship with the ability to move on land as well as on the sea. Enemies, frightened, discover this feature and flee at full speed to avoid being crushed. Meanwhile, on the wagon, Chiffon is delighted that her husband has come to save her. The Nostra Castello strafes its enemies and makes its way to the wagon carrying Big Mom\u0027s wedding cake, while Oven is enraged, much to Bege\u0027s delight. Bege orders his wife to give him the cake immediately, but this decision seems insane. However, Sanji manages to lift the cake into the air by jumping and holding its base with just one leg! Seeing Bege, he reveals his face and orders her to make room on the deck as he intends to land the cart on it. Dazzled by Sanji\u0027s heroism, Pudding fails, much to the dismay of the Cacao Island cooks.\n\nNot far away, in Chips Town, Luffy and Br\u00fbl\u00e9e make their appearance but are spotted by the townspeople, who immediately raise the alarm. Le Chapeau de Paille has no choice but to flee, and finds himself back in Mirror World with Br\u00fbl\u00e9e before rushing into another mirror to reach Oshimuna Town. In Sweet City, Charlotte Mont d\u0027Or is informed of this news and doesn\u0027t understand why the Straw Hat is playing hide-and-seek with them. Luffy then travels to Green Town, where his presence is reported. For her part, Katakuri listens attentively to the snail calls and eagerly awaits Luffy\u0027s return to the Mirror World. The latter is in the company of Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, who asks him what all the fuss is about, when the simplest thing would be to head straight for Cacao Island. Le Chapeau de Paille is astonished to hear this, and soon discovers that everyone knew that \u00cele Cacao was the agreed meeting point for the Chapeaux de Paille. Br\u00fbl\u00e9e orders him to give up, as he doesn\u0027t stand a chance against his brother. But Luffy disagrees. Certainly, he knows from experience that Haki is not inexhaustible and that it takes time to recover. It must be the same for Katakuri: the longer the battle goes on, the weaker his Observation Haki becomes. He suddenly remembered Rayleigh\u0027s teachings on Rusukaina Island, who had told him that he had to be vigilant, anticipating his enemies\u0027 movements before they made a move. He had also taught him that his Haki would become even stronger when facing powerful enemies. Determined to do just that, Luffy wondered if he could see into the future like Katakuri, before telling Br\u00fbl\u00e9e that he was ready to defeat the man with a billion Berrys bounty once and for all...",

        "description": "In the Mirror World, Katakuri is eagerly awaiting Luffy\u0027s return. He has noticed that ten minutes have passed and nothing has happened. He wonders whether his adversary has fled instead of coming to confront him once again. Suddenly, he had a premonition, and as he turned around, he saw the Straw Hat approaching to continue his duel with him after recovering his Haki. As Luffy launches his attack, his opponent wonders what he\u0027s doing there.\nAt the same time, on Cacao Island, the Nostra Castello makes its way across the land to meet Sanji, who has blown away the cake and the cart carrying it! Big Mom\u0027s soldiers are astonished by this prodigy. The Black Leg orders Capone Bege to make room on the deck of his ship so that he can safely land the wagon and the cake destined for Big Mom. The mafia pirate obeys, while Charlotte Oven, who has recovered from her attack, wonders who the man is holding the cart in the air with just one leg! Suddenly, he sees the man launch the cart towards the Nostra Castello, which lands heavily on the deck of the huge amphibious ship. Sanji joins the Fire Tank crew, while Bege cuts the reindeer connecting the wagon to the seal towing it. The seal is brutally thrown overboard. On the Nostra Castello, it\u0027s time to celebrate. Chiffon throws herself around her husband\u0027s neck and thanks him warmly for coming to save her. For his part, Pets is delighted to find his mother safe and sound.\n\nThe Nostra Castello continue on their way, but Oven is determined to stop them. Despite the pleas of his men, he decided to get in front of the moving ship and risk being crushed! However, his determination was no match, and Oven ended up flattened. This slight mishap brought tears to the eyes of little Pets, who was soon consoled by his mother. For his part, the wounded Pound sees the amphibious ship pass by. He saw his daughter on board, looking after her grandson. The latter had finished crying and smiled happily when he saw him. Pound realizes that his daughter Chiffon has found happiness at last, and he is delighted.\n\nOn the amphibious ship, Chiffon asks her husband to head for the southeast of the island, and Bege obeys. They\u0027ll have to pass through Chocolate Town before reaching the sea, at the expense of some chocolate houses in the Nostra Castello\u0027s path. Without slowing down, Bege\u0027s ship pulverizes several houses, despite Sanji\u0027s disgust at seeing food being wasted! On their side, Big Mom\u0027s soldiers put up a barrage to prevent them from reaching the sea, but they are no match for the Nostra Castello\u0027s men, who machine-gun them without restraint. Finally, Capone Bege\u0027s ship reaches the shore and rushes out to sea, while a group of Tartan ships head for his position to attack. At last, everyone is happy to be able to leave Cacao Island safely. Sanji thanks Bege for saving them, but Bege explains that it was not he who had come to rescue them, but his wife. Suddenly, Vito sees dead fish rising to the surface of the sea. For his part, Sanji noticed that the sea temperature had risen sharply, and Bege found out who was responsible: it was Charlotte Oven! The latter, using the powers of his Demon Fruit, was heating the sea to the point of boiling it! However, such treatment would be fatal for Big Mom\u0027s cake, which was melting and losing its flavor. To make matters worse, the Nostra Castello has lost a turbine and could sink at any moment. Charlotte Oven, for her part, is pleased with the result, which brings new tears to the eyes of little Pets.\n\nSuddenly, Capone Bege\u0027s son stops crying, incomprehensibly. On the shore, a man is knocking out Big Mom\u0027s men with a club. It\u0027s Pound, who\u0027s also at it with Oven. But his weapon shatters as soon as it touches the head of Big Mom\u0027s son. The latter, very upset with his ex-father-in-law, approaches him, while the occupants of the Nostra Castello have noticed that the sea temperature is dropping. Chiffon orders her husband\u0027s men to leave these inhospitable waters as soon as possible. On shore, Pound catches sight of his grandson\u0027s smiling face and can\u0027t help but think of the birth of his daughters, Laura and Chiffon, whom he was unable to bear because he was driven away by their mother with a strict ban on seeing his children again. However, Pound is pleased to see that Chiffon is happy and congratulates her on her marriage, while Oven is about to hit him from behind with a flaming blade, bringing new tears to Pets\u0027 eyes.\n\nThe Nostra Castello is now a long way from Cacao Island and all its occupants can finally breathe. Charlotte Pudding is happy that the cake for Big Mom has not been damaged. For his part, Sanji is worried. He instructs the cooks accompanying him not to waste any time and to start decorating the cake as soon as possible. They all agree enthusiastically. At the same time, Big Mom has tracked down the Sunny. On board, Brook is appalled, while Jinbei advises his companions that the only thing they can do is flee, otherwise they\u0027ll be lost! Their opponents hurl cannonballs at them, which are in fact Homies. Nami manages to coax them before they hit the Sunny and end up falling beside their target. Charlotte Bavarois, Big Mom\u0027s 26th son, witnesses the scene and can\u0027t believe his eyes. He can\u0027t understand why they haven\u0027t managed to catch up with the Sunny, and one of his sailors tells him that the enemy ship is being maneuvered by Jinbei, who knows the sea better than anyone else. Suddenly, Charlotte Bavarian receives a snail phone call that seems to satisfy him. From the Sunny\u0027s lookout, Carrot sees something unusual with his binoculars: boats are coming to meet them! The Sunny\u0027s occupants realize that they\u0027re in a pincer movement, and that there\u0027s no way out.\n\nAt the same time, in Mirror World, Luffy ferociously attacks Katakuri, who doesn\u0027t give in. He dodges all his attacks with his powers. Taking advantage of a moment\u0027s respite between two attacks, he asks Luffy why he\u0027s come back to confront him when he could have run away and it wouldn\u0027t be dishonorable for him; but Luffy gives him no answer...",

He then sees two reasons why he might have decided to return: choosing death in battle, or wanting to join Big Mom\u0027s crew. Luffy retaliates with an attack, declaring that he\u0027s come back to defeat him. The Sweet Commander easily dodges the young pirate\u0027s punches and replies that he doesn\u0027t see such an option in the future, while their battle continues unabated.\nMeanwhile, at sea, under a full moon obscured by clouds, the Thousand Sunny is surrounded by Big Mom\u0027s fleet. The strangely thinned-out Big Mom vows that her enemies will not escape. On the Sunny, the situation is grave. Jinbei, at the helm, asks Carrot who owns the fleet facing them. The Mink grabs her binoculars and reads Daifuku\u0027s name on the flagship. At the same time, Daifuku vows to destroy the Straw Hats. At the same time, Charlotte Bavarois is made aware of Daifuku\u0027s presence and is pleased when he learns that reinforcements are arriving to the rescue, commanded by Charlotte Smoothie.\n\nFrom the lookout, Carrot also sees Daifuku\u0027s arrival and tells his friends, who have no idea how to get out of this predicament, especially as Jinbei knows Daifuku very well, who is a powerful man capable of controlling a genie. Daifuku uses a snail phone to order his fleet of Tarts to pincer the Straw Hat ship, then asks Charlotte Perospero, perched on Big Mom\u0027s shoulder, if he has permission to sink his enemies\u0027 ship. The latter gives him carte blanche, while he notices that his mother has curiously lost weight.\n\nDaifuku\u0027s fleet gets underway. They point all their cannons at the Sunny and prepare to fire! From the lookout, Carrot warns his friends of this great danger. They have no choice but to rush ahead without stopping, at the risk of facing very powerful enemies. The members of the Chapeau de Paille crew prepare for battle.\n\nAs Daifuku\u0027s fleet is about to fire its cannonballs, Carrot, atop the lookout, gazes wistfully at the full moon obscured by clouds. She remembers Pedro\u0027s teaching and his wise words: \u0022Everyone deserves his moment of glory. On deck, as her friends prepare for battle, they are suddenly hailed by Carrot, who tells them that she will personally take charge of the Daifuku fleet. This statement comes as a surprise to her comrades. Carrot goes on to confide that she\u0027ll be a great help, as the night they\u0027ll be fighting is a full moon. Jinbei, stunned, understands that Carrot has mastered the art of \u0022Sulong\u0022, while Carrot explains that Pedro had trained her and that it is her duty as a musketeer to act.\n\nAs Daifuku orders his gunners to stand by, thinking of Pedro, Carrot stares at the full moon and begins to transform before his friends\u0027 eyes: his fur thickens, his pupils shrink, his claws lengthen and his hair grows into a mane. After completing her transformation in an explosion of electricity, she sports extremely dense white fur and red eyes that surprise Chopper, who points out to his friends that Carrot now looks like a completely different person.\n\nWatching her friend transform, Nami recalls Duke Inuarashi\u0027s words that the \u0022true form of the Minks\u0022 emerges during the full moon. On Daifuku\u0027s ship, a sailor reports that the Mink has changed into Sulong, which Daifuku explains by the fact that Pedro and Carrot come from Zou. Meanwhile, Carrot, impassive, leaps from the Sunny onto the deck of his ship, dodging a volley of bullets, and neutralizes many of the pirates on board by electrocuting them, while Chopper watches the scene through binoculars, dumbfounded. Daifuku is enraged, and asks her what she intends to accomplish on her own. He discovers, to his horror, that the Mink has managed to tear off the ship\u0027s rudder, leaving the flagship at the mercy of the waves.\n\nFurious at Carrot for sneaking onto a Tart ship, Charlotte Daifuku uses her powers to summon her genie, who furiously attacks the Mink with a halberd. Her attack slices several Big Mom Crew ships in half, but is dodged by Carrot, who continues to destroy all the ships\u0027 rudders. On the Thousand Sunny, Nami and Chopper are impressed by Carrot\u0027s performance. The young sailor sees her friend jumping from one boat to the next, inciting her enemies to fight among themselves. For his part, Jinbe explains the origins of the Sulong form: the light of the full moon awakens in the Minks their most bestial instincts, which once drove them to destroy everything indiscriminately. He also reveals that if she remains too long in the grip of this form, Carrot could die. Hearing this, Brook decides to go to her aid, and jumps overboard before running across the water at full speed towards her. On the Sunny, Nami ordered her comrades to move forward at full speed, while their friends took charge of opening an escape route.\n\nHowever, the occupants of the Thousand Sunny faced another danger: they were within range of Charlotte Bavarian\u0027s guns. Charlotte Bavarois fired a salvo that just missed its target. He then orders new shots, which Chopper immediately intercepts. Meanwhile, in Mirror World, Luffy and Katakuri engage in a merciless battle of Haki versus Haki. As usual, the Straw Hat is no match for his opponent, but he doesn\u0027t give up. As Katakuri prepares to launch another attack, Luffy clears his head after recalling Rayleigh\u0027s teachings. But the Straw Hat is struck by Katakuri\u0027s powerful blow and falls face down. Big Mom\u0027s son doesn\u0027t understand Luffy\u0027s stubborn attitude towards fighting him. The young pirate shushes him before rushing towards him, rage in his heart, in yet another attack...",

        "description": "In the Mirror World, Katakuri prepares to face Luffy in single combat. Luffy has closed his eyes and cleared his head. But he\u0027s crushed by a powerful blow from his opponent, who doesn\u0027t understand why the young pirate still insists on fighting him. Luffy silences him and warns him that he will defeat him. With these words, he launches himself against Katakuri, but all his attacks are thwarted by Big Mom\u0027s son, who gives him a stinging beating.\nMeanwhile, the Thousand Sunny is raining cannonballs from Charlotte\u0027s Bavarian fleet. On the instructions of Nami and Chopper, Jinbei steers the ship and saves it from being hit by one of the cannonballs. For her part, Big Mom is getting worse and worse. Emaciated and struggling to breathe, she calls for the immediate presence of Prometheus and Zeus, her faithful homies. Her son, Perospero, is worried about her condition. He hopes his mother can hold out until they arrive on Cacao Island. Charlotte Bavarois informs her older brother that Pudding is sailing to meet them on the ship carrying the famous wedding cake, which belongs to Capone Bege. This news horrifies Perospero, who wants to know why the cake that will save his mother is on board his assassin\u0027s ship.\n\nIn the middle of the ocean, the clock on the Nostra Castello strikes nine. Under Sanji\u0027s orders, the Cacao Island cooks are busy decorating the wedding cake. Suddenly, two men from Capone Bege pour the contents of a barrel into a basin. It\u0027s poison. Sanji immediately throws the barrel overboard, then insults Bege, who doesn\u0027t understand Jambe Noire\u0027s attitude. The mobster had intended to rig the cake with explosives and poison it, in order to eliminate the Empress once and for all. But Sanji assures him that he will defeat Big Mom thanks to his pastry. Moreover, he explains that his honor as a cook is at stake, and claims that only the flavor of the cake will be enough to neutralize Big Mom. Bege protests, but Sanji shoves a spoonful of his Cr\u00e8me Simsim into his mouth, and the mobster immediately collapses. His worried crew discover that he\u0027s about to die of delight. Sanji then declares that Bege is free to kill Big Mom if he wants, but only after she\u0027s eaten the cake he\u0027s made for her. He also adds that it\u0027s his duty as a cook, causing Pudding to faint. For his part, Chiffon then convinces Bege and orders his men to finish topping the cake. As for Sanji, he\u0027s worried about the fate of his friends.\n\nNot far away, Zeus and Prometheus are late and busy flying over the ocean towards Big Mom and Napoleon. Along the way, Zeus moralises his friend for his gluttony, warning him not to betray their mistress again, and then sets off again. At the same time, on Sunny\u0027s side, the fleet that had been blocking their path begins to disperse, thanks to Carrot who continues to rip the rudders off the ships. Nami and Chopper are busy neutralizing the cannonballs sent by Charlotte\u0027s Bavarian ships, while Jinbei steers the ship in a straight line. Meanwhile, Carrot continues to wreak havoc on the enemy ships, while Brook rushes to meet him, running as fast as he can across the sea. However, he is spotted by Charlotte Daifuku\u0027s sailors, who target him. He neutralizes them by playing his violin. His music instantly puts them to sleep. For her part, Carrot continues her devastating work, but is pursued by Daifuku\u0027s genius, who attacks her again. She dodges, but suddenly realizes that her strength will soon be exhausted. Fortunately, Brook arrives and recovers her in extremis before the genie\u0027s halberd blade can reach her. Holding the living skeleton\u0027s shoulders, Carrot thanks her savior. She explains that she must avoid looking at the full moon in order to return to her normal state, either by closing her eyes or covering them with glasses or a hat. While on board the Straw Hat ship, Nami compliments Carrot on his bravery, Bavarois informs Perospero that their brother Daifuku can no longer stop their enemies, as his ships are drifting away. This is very distressing for the eldest son of the Charlotte Family, who notices that his mother\u0027s condition has taken a turn for the worse. Suddenly, Big Mom, after asking Napoleon if Prometheus and Zeus were nearby, leapt into the air and landed on the back of Zeus, who had just arrived in the company of Prometheus. Prometheus sets his mistress\u0027s hair on fire, giving her a demonic look. While Perospero is stunned by her agility and surprising lightness, Big Mom orders Napoleon to turn into a saber, then flies off in the direction of Sunny, but it\u0027s far too late when Chopper spots her. Big Mom jumps off Zeus\u0027 back and lands on the deck of the Sunny, damaging the rail and immediately demanding her wedding cake. The Straw Hats are stunned, while Jinbei nervously declares that no one will intervene and that they must abandon ship right away.\n\nBig Mom, irritated by hunger, begins her search: to peek into the kitchen, she destroys an entire section of wall. Brook wonders how they\u0027ll be able to fight such a monster, while Jinbei thinks of a solution. Meanwhile, in Mirror World, Katakuri is about to attack Luffy. The Straw Hat is no match for the strength of the Swwet Commander, who once again inflicts a stinging beating. Luffy tries to defend himself, but it\u0027s no use: Katakuri is the stronger! Suddenly, the young pirate remembers Rayleigh\u0027s principles and decides to apply them, much to the surprise of his adversary...",

        "description": "In the Mirror World, Luffy struggles to his feet after his last battle with Katakuri. Katakuri calmly advances in his direction to finish him off. Suddenly, he stops after having a premonition and wonders what his opponent has in mind. The Straw Hat clears his head again as Katakuri launches another attack. Using his powers, he flattens him like a pancake. However, this technique doesn\u0027t work on Luffy, who escapes by inflating his elastic body considerably. Yet Katakuri has not said his last word and strikes again, using the full power of his Haki. Luffy tries to dodge his attacks, but is powerless against his opponent\u0027s phenomenal strength. What\u0027s more, these relentless attacks don\u0027t allow Luffy to concentrate and find a way to overcome Katakuri. Yet he tries, keeping calm as his adversary aims a machine gun in his direction and shoots him without warning.\nAt the same time, on the seas of the Totto Land Archipelago, Big Mom has landed aboard the Thousand Sunny and, while wrecking the ship, demands her wedding cake. The whole crew is petrified. Jinbei tries to reason with her, telling her that the cake she\u0027s looking for isn\u0027t on board. Big Mom doesn\u0027t believe him, however, and reveals that she has every confidence in Perospero, who had assured her that the wedding cake was indeed on board the Straw Hat ship. She does, however, point out that if her eldest son has lied to her, she will be obliged to take his life with her own hands, words that stun Charlotte Perospero, who thought he was safe after having so easily fooled his mother. On their respective ships, Daifuku and Smoothie witness their older brother\u0027s troubles. Irritated that he calls her son a liar, Big Mom brandishes Napoleon and attacks Jinbei. Napoleon uses Cognac and bursts into flames, allowing Big Mom to shoot him at Jinbei. While Nami and Chopper beg their friend to flee, Fishman covers his forearms with Haki and builds a defense with the Sharkskin technique to counter the Empress\u0027s attack. To the surprise of Daifuku and Perospero, he initially succeeds in blocking Napoleon, but is quickly caught off guard and thrown overboard when Big Mom reinforces her attack.\n\nAfter getting rid of one opponent, Big Mom, hungrier than ever, tries to destroy another part of Sunny with her sword, but Nami begs her to stop, revealing that Carrot was resting in that part of the ship. The Empress then turns her attention to the young sailor and attacks her with Napoleon, while the flames from her hair begin to ignite the ship\u0027s main sail. Nami manages to dodge, but Big Mom then tries to crush her under the palm of her hand. Fortunately, Chopper intervenes and protects Nami by transforming into Guard Point. Amazed by this prodigy, Big Mom grabs Chopper and vows to add him and Brook to her personal collection of strange beasts. She also tells him that once she eats his wedding cake, she\u0027ll make Brook and Chopper her regular servants. Witnessing this scene, Perospero and Daifuku notice that the Sunny\u0027s fire continues to spread, as does Brook, who begins to panic as he searches in vain for a way to extinguish the flames that are beginning to burn the sails. Just then, Jinbei, from the sea, sprays seawater onto the ship, instantly extinguishing the flames and neutralizing Prometheus. He then leaps aboard and orders Big Mom to leave, before punching her in the stomach with the ultimate Fishman Karate technique, the Vagabond\u0027s Spin. To the amazement of Charlotte Daifuku and Perospero, Big Mom is ejected from the ship!\n\nBefore her mistress falls into the ocean, Zeus recovers her in extremis on his back. Meanwhile, Brook and his friends thank Jinbei for chasing Big Mom away, but he orders them to speed up the Sunny to prevent Charlotte Perospero and her fleet from catching up. Above the Sunny, floating on Zeus, Big Mom has an idea: she\u0027s preparing to slice the ship in half to find the wedding cake more quickly. Napoleon agrees, and lies down; while aboard the Sunny, the Straw Hats panic. Nami tries to coax Zeus with Black Balls, but he doesn\u0027t let himself be fooled a second time and tries to electrocute Nami. Just as he hits her, Brook protects Nami by standing in front of her and confronts his opponent, knowing that lightning had no effect on him as he\u0027s only made of bone. He then turns to Big Mom, who is standing on Zeus and preparing to slice through the ship. After asking her to show him her panties, he leaps towards her and slices Zeus in half with his Hanauta Sancho technique: Yahazugiri. Nami then uses Zeus\u0027s lightning and negatively-charged Black Balls to produce a gigantic electric discharge that violently electrocutes Big Mom.\n\nAt the same time, in Mirror World, Luffy clears his head just as Katakuri is about to attack him. But the Straw Hat can do nothing against such power. After the attack, Katakuri congratulates the young pirate on being a valiant fighter, before delivering the coup de gr\u00e2ce, stating that his future would be plunged into darkness. Luffy disagrees, throwing himself headlong against his adversary, exclaiming that his future belonged to him alone...",

It\u0027s half past nine in the evening. Meanwhile, on Whole Cake Island, Count Niwatori is also pondering the outcome of the fight, but is interrupted by Stussy. She reveals to him and Charlotte Mont d\u0027Or that it was the Tamatebako that produced the explosion that brought down the castle, despite Morgans\u0027 protests that this news should be exclusive to his newspaper.\nAt the same time, in Mirror World, the battle between Luffy and Katakuri resumed in earnest. The young pirate attacked his opponent relentlessly, but all his attempts failed due to Katakuri\u0027s gift of premonition. Not far away, Charlotte Flampe, the 36th daughter of the Charlotte Family and honorary president of Katakuri\u0027s fan club, observes the fight and orders one of her men, armed with a crossbow, to shoot Luffy. But the pirate is far too quick, and Flambe\u0027s sniper misses every time. Annoyed, she suppresses him, figuring that her older brother will be able to take out his opponent with ease. However, Luffy proves to be a tough opponent and manages to dodge one of Katakuri\u0027s attacks, much to her amazement. For his part, Flambe can\u0027t understand why the Straw Hat hasn\u0027t given up yet, when he doesn\u0027t stand a chance against his older brother! Despite all the blows Luffy receives, he stubbornly continues to get up and attack Katakuri relentlessly. Katakuri tells him that he can anticipate his every move and that he\u0027ll never be able to defeat him. Now at his mercy, Luffy dives back into his memories and remembers Rayleigh\u0027s words.\n\nAbove Sunny, Big Mom is struck down by Nami\u0027s attack, much to the surprise of Perospero and Charlotte Bavarois. The Straw Hats take advantage of this to escape, while Prometheus recovers Big Mom before she falls into the water. Zeus, for his part, drained of all his energy, is captured by Brook. Brook then hands him over to Nami. Looking menacing, the young sailor offers him two options: either to enter her service and become her slave, or to die. As Sunny flees, Big Mom rises to her feet and orders Prometheus to hunt down the pirates.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Mirror World, Luffy relives his training with Rayleigh on the island of Ruskaina. The former right-hand man of Gol D. Roger had taught the future King of Pirates that every attack had a purpose and an aura. One day, Luffy had smelled Rayleigh\u0027s food cooking over a fire. Trying to attack his master, Luffy deliberately hit the pot of food, angering Rayleigh. As he violently struck Luffy with a stick, the latter felt something, which was more or less anger - it was his Haki! Back to the present. Luffy, still absorbed in his memories, is watched for a long time by Flambe, who wonders what he\u0027s doing. Suddenly, the Straw Hat is struck by Katakuri. He gets up and clears his head to sharpen his senses. His opponent takes the opportunity to attack him again. To his astonishment, Luffy manages to dodge the attack, but is quickly defeated again. Far from having said his last word, he rises to his feet, telling himself that every attack has a will of its own and reveals a clue. Thanks to this valuable information, Luffy manages to stop one of Katakuri\u0027s attacks, much to his amazement. He hits him hard, and as he stands up again, Luffy tells himself that he, too, can see the near future...",

All the latter\u0027s attacks are stopped by the Straw Hat, who now possesses the gift of being able to see into the future after having succeeded in strengthening his Observation Haki. Big Mom\u0027s son is not happy that his enemy has acquired this gift, as the fight is about to get more complicated for him. However, Katakuri has not said his last word and harasses Luffy endlessly. Luffy becomes his plaything and does everything he can to regain the upper hand. Armed with his trident, Katakuri advances in his direction while Luffy concentrates once again. But despite all his efforts, he can do nothing against his adversary, who strikes him in all directions, reminding him that he can read him like a book. However, against all odds, Luffy manages to regain his calm and serenity. He briefly sees into the future and blocks a giant mochi fist. Katakuri notices that Luffy is using his Observation Haki, but regains the upper hand before revealing that Big Mom\u0027s crew already know about Nami\u0027s rendezvous with Luffy on Cacao Island at 1 a.m., and advises Luffy not to get up again. Although he explains that his brothers and sisters will be waiting with bated breath for Luffy if he manages to leave the Mirror World, the Straw Hat still gets up, promising that he\u0027ll defeat him.\nAt the same time, at sea, aboard the Nostra Castello, the wedding cake decoration is finally complete, after Sanji puts the finishing touches by adding a garland of whipped cream roses to the top of the huge pastry. While Capone Bege and his men rejoice that the cake will take Big Mom straight to heaven, Pudding and the members of WCI 31 collapse, exhausted. Sanji then thanks Chiffon and his younger sister for their invaluable help, as the cake will save his friends. However, Pudding reacts immediately. She retorts that her friends are probably already dead, or that Big Mom won\u0027t like the cake. Chiffon immediately called her to order, and Pudding regained control of her words, but the damage had already been done. Her words had hurt Sanji.\n\nAt the same time, the Sunny\u0027s occupants were about to face Big Mom\u0027s vengeful wrath. Faced with a fait accompli, Chopper, in his Monster Point form, with the help of Brook and Jinbei, tries to fend off the onslaught of Big Mom, who is perched on the back of a gigantic, angry Prometheus, while Sanji, on the Nostra Castello, promises that he will stop Big Mom with his cake no matter what, just as Luffy swears that he will emerge victorious from his fight with Katakuri because their friends believe in them.\n\nA fierce fight takes place on the deck of the Sunny between Chopper and Big Mom. The young reindeer defends himself from the Empress\u0027s sword blows with his claws. But the charge is too much for him. Nami immediately comes to his rescue with her climatic wand. However, she is targeted by Prometheus, who hurls a burning blast at her, immediately stopped by Brook\u0027s ice barrier, which shatters into a thousand pieces under the impact. Big Mom attacks again, wounding Chopper in the shoulder with Napoleon. The young reindeer collapses under the pain, then stands up again, promising Big Mom that he\u0027ll throw himself into the sea and take her with him. Big Mom is amused by this announcement and asks him if he can really beat her. With that, she orders Prometheus to grow as big as possible until he becomes a huge ball of fire hovering over Sunny. Nami is petrified at the sight, while Jinbei realizes that escape is now pointless. Suddenly, as the Straw Hats face this critical situation, a ship appears on the horizon! A troubled Big Mom feels a delicious smell approaching her nostrils, which can only be that of her long-sought wedding cake!\n\nOn board the Thousand Sunny, the Straw Hats are relieved to see the Nostra Castello sailing towards them with the wedding cake on board, while on Prometheus, Big Mom is attracted by the scent of the cake. The Fire Tank Crew prepare for battle, and Capone Bege compliments the Straw Hats\u0027 effort in surviving their pursuers for so long. Upon spotting Nami, Sanji begins to dance frenetically with joy, intriguing the Straw Hats and Charlotte Bavarois. For his part, Perospero is surprised that they\u0027ve managed to remake the wedding cake exactly as it was, but remains suspicious that the huge pastry must have been poisoned. However, he\u0027s not sure whether he should destroy the cake and lead Totto Land to destruction; or let his mother eat the cake at the risk of her dying, and thus bringing down Big Mom\u0027s Crew and the whole country. Meanwhile, Chopper is relieved to find that Big Mom has halted her assault on the Sunny. He wouldn\u0027t have lasted another minute. For his part, Bege assures Sanji that he\u0027ll take care of giving Big Mom the cake himself, after which he\u0027ll be free to murder her. Sanji nods in agreement, while Pudding, sitting on Rabian, bids farewell to Chiffon, who wishes her all the happiness in the world. After this, Sanji camouflages himself under the folds of Pudding\u0027s flying carpet, which discreetly flies off in the direction of Sunny. At the same time, Big Mom orders Prometheus to chase the Nostra Castello, while Bege orders his men to head for the Isle of Liquor, a choice that surprises Perospero, who thinks that the Straw Hats and Bege want to divide them by splitting up.\n\nFar from these concerns, Pudding and Sanji reach Thousand Sunny without a hitch. The latter is greeted by Nami, Brook and Chopper. At the sight of Nami hugging him tightly, Sanji is confused but soon comes to his senses. He explains to his companions that Bege is trying to lure Big Mom to a nearby island in order to assassinate her. This is very advantageous for the Straw Hats, as they are no longer hunted by the Empress. Sanji then finds that Big Mom has inflicted considerable damage on the Sunny, prompting Jinbei to apologize for not taking care of their ship. He is reprimanded by Chopper for his humility, but Sanji cuts short the discussion before asking where Carrot and Pedro are. At this question, Brook takes fright and lies to him, claiming that they\u0027re both resting in a room. Behind them, Bavarian asks his older brother for advice on what to do: chase the Straw Hats or follow Big Mom. Suddenly, Perospero is contacted by Bege\u0027s snail phone.\n\nAt the same time, in Mirror World, Luffy is engaged in a fierce battle with Katakuri. But his attacks are thwarted by his opponent\u0027s gift of premonition, as he shamelessly attacks him with his powers. For her part, Charlotte Flampe rejoices at the imminent death of the Straw Hat and, to speed things up, aims her blowpipe at Luffy with the aim of shooting him dead while the latter is in the midst of a battle with Katakuri...",

        "description": "In the Mirror World, Charlotte Flampe is closely watching the fight between Luffy and Katakuri and suspects that the duel will soon end in defeat for the Straw Hat. However, she wants to speed things up and aims her blowpipe at Luffy. Meanwhile, Luffy confronts his opponent. The Straw Hat closes his eyes and concentrates as Katakuri attacks him. Luffy manages to dodge his blow and attacks Katakuri with violence. Katakuri avoids being hit and uses his powers to attack Luffy, who can no longer dodge his blows. He ends up falling to the ground at Katakuri\u0027s feet, who urges him not to get up again. Watching his enemy, Big Mom\u0027s son notices that Luffy\u0027s mastery of Haki is getting closer and closer to his own! However, Luffy doesn\u0027t give up and eventually gets to his feet. Suddenly, a searing pain seized his right thigh: it was Flambe who had just fired a dart from his blowpipe. For his part, Katakuri takes advantage of the opportunity to finish off his opponent once and for all before he reaches his level of Haki mastery. He inflates his arm with his powers and, using Mogura, attacks Luffy. The latter tries to dodge, but it\u0027s too late as his left flank is pierced by the trident. Badly wounded, Luffy lets out a cry of intense pain, while nearby Flampe laughs out loud.\nMeanwhile, back on Whole Cake Island, Charlotte Mont d\u0027Or is out of his mind, thinking that the castle explosion was part of the Straw Hats\u0027 plan. He orders his entire fleet to pursue the fugitives to Cacao Island and destroy them. For her part, the Nostra Castello is pursued by Big Mom and her fleet. Charlotte Perospero, furious, asks Capone Bege via snail phone why the wedding cake is on his ship. The mafia boss replies that he and his crew will take it upon themselves to calm Big Mom down before letting her go unharmed. However, Perospero is not fooled and urges his brother Bavarois to go after the Nostra Castello. Then, when Bavarois asks him about the Straw Hats, he reassures him that another fleet is waiting at Cocoa Island to sink them, and contacts Smoothie by snail phone. She picks up and confirms that she is right behind them. Perospero orders her to track down the Straw Hats, while he and Bavarois chase Big Mom and Bege to Liqueur Island. Smoothie nods in agreement and immediately passes on the orders to his sisters, Charlotte Citron and Charlotte Cinnamon, saying they should have let them do it all along. At his side, Citron complains about receiving order after order, having preferred to rest on Cocoa Island while waiting for the Straw Hats; while Cinnamon criticizes her brothers\u0027 decisions, and declares that the men are nothing but idiots. Smoothie sternly reprimands them, before ordering his men to prepare for battle before the fugitives reach Cocoa Island.\n\nAt the same time, on the Thousand Sunny, Sanji reveals to his terrified companions that Big Mom\u0027s Crew knows of their rendezvous with Luffy on Cocoa Island, and asserts that the island must by now be occupied by a large fleet that is eagerly awaiting them. When Jinbei declares that Big Mom\u0027s Crew seem to have recognized them as dangerous enemies, Sanji replies that they will save Luffy and decamp from here no matter what. He also tells him that defeat would be inevitable if they had to confront this fleet directly. Meanwhile, in Mirror World, Luffy is writhing in pain following Katakuri\u0027s attack. Katakuri laughs at him for not being able to block his spear, while Flambe and his men laugh at the Straw Hat, who groans at the feet of his victor. The latter, annoyed by his moans, violently attacks Luffy, who has risen to his feet and is defending himself as best he can, while Flampe is happy that her plan has worked so well and dreams of how Katakuri will reward her for helping him in his fight.\n\nWhile Tandie was raving, the fight between Luffy and Katakuri had resumed. Big Mom\u0027s son, armed with his Mogura trident, shamelessly attacked his opponent, warning him that if Luffy had a single moment\u0027s inattention, the fight would be over for him. The Straw Hat dodges his attacks, but is no match for Katakuri\u0027s rage. He tries several times to strike the Straw Hat with his spear, but it eludes him. Yet Katakuri manages to attack Luffy with a constant barrage of punches that split the ground around his opponent.\n\nMeanwhile, Bege and his crew are pursued by Big Mom, Prometheus and Napoleon. As Chiffon thanks Bege, a crew member remarks that assassination seems impossible, now that they\u0027re being pursued. However, Chiffon reassures them and asks them to trust the wedding cake made by Sanji. Back at Sunny, Smoothie has chased the Straw Hat ship, much to the delight of his men. For his part, Jinbei noticed that Smoothie\u0027s fleet was chasing them. The situation is getting worse. However, Nami confirms to her friends that they should arrive at Cocoa Island in a little over three hours\u0027 time, i.e. around 1am. Chopper declares, however, that they have no way of contacting Luffy, but Sanji decides to go ahead anyway. He has come up with a plan to get to Cocoa Island safely.\n\nAt the same time, on the outskirts of Cocoa Island, numerous ships from Big Mom\u0027s crew begin to spread out around the coast. When a subordinate asks if this is really necessary, Charlotte Oven replies that it was Tamago and Mont d\u0027Or\u0027s idea. Indeed, the latter protests over the snail phone that the Straw Hats are not to be underestimated, and reveals that they are responsible for the destruction of Whole Cake Castle. Oven then warns the citizens of Chocolate Town that the Straw Hats will visit their island in three hours, at one o\u0027clock in the morning. He orders them to destroy or throw into the sea all their mirrors on pain of death, so that only one remains. So, if Luffy manages to defeat Katakuri, he\u0027ll have to pass through this single mirror, beyond which Oven\u0027s men will be waiting in ambush. Inside the Mirror World, Luffy is in a bad way. Having lost a tooth during his battle with Katakuri, the Straw Hat has lost consciousness. Nearby, Katakuri expresses his disappointment at having witnessed Luffy\u0027s release, saying he was just beginning to recognize Luffy\u0027s value. In his coma, Luffy recalls his training on Ruskaina Island with Silvers Rayleigh, then gets up again. However, Luffy has great difficulty standing up, as his right leg is in pain. Witnessing his condition, Flambe prepares to fire another numbing dart at the Straw Hat, while Katakuri observes his pitiful adversary. From his hiding place, Flambe blows into his blowpipe just as Luffy closes his eyes. Much to the surprise of Katakuri\u0027s little sister, the Straw Hat manages to dodge his silent needle. In fact, he has just fallen, provoking further mockery from Charlotte Flampe and her men. Katakuri hears the laughter and wonders if he isn\u0027t being spied on by a member of his family...",

        "description": "Luffy is in a bad way after Katakuri\u0027s latest attack and is struggling to get up. All his attempts are mocked by Flampe and his men, who can\u0027t stop laughing. This mockery, which goes on behind Big Mom\u0027s son\u0027s back, exasperates him to no end. For his part, the Straw Hat tried to get back on his feet without much success, provoking further laughter from Flampe. She couldn\u0027t help laughing, attracting Katakuri\u0027s attention despite his men\u0027s pleas for her to calm down. Flampe laughed again and was surprised to see Katakuri approaching her. While Flampe daydreams about how her big brother will reward her for helping him in the fight, Katakuri sternly reprimands her for her actions, and notes that Luffy suddenly lost his concentration in the middle of the fight due to Flambe\u0027s silent shot.\nOne of Flambe\u0027s subordinates notices that Luffy had straightened up and tries to warn her, but she doesn\u0027t listen and flies towards Katakuri. Furious at their laughter, Katakuri inflicts a huge wound on himself in the same place as Luffy by piercing his right flank with his trident, in order to get back on equal terms with the latter. This action shocks everyone, and blood splatters Flampe\u0027s angelic face. He then removes his scarf, revealing his terrifying face, and angrily berates Flampe and his subordinates for interfering in a fight between men, declaring that if they\u0027re laughing at Luffy, they should laugh at Katakuri too. Flampe and his subordinates apparently don\u0027t hear him, being fixed only in shock and horror at his distorted mouth. Flampe backs away, losing all respect for him, and insults him by calling him a \u0022dogfish\u0022 before spitting his gum in his face, while his subordinates mock his appearance by taking up their young mistress\u0027s insult. Painful memories flash through Katakuri\u0027s mind as he turns on his heels to find Luffy: children walking away from Katakuri as a child, mocking his mouth. On the way back to the battle site, Katakuri is again taunted by his younger sister, who has ordered her men to take photos of her older brother, so that she can reveal his deformity to everyone in Totto Land Archipelago.\n\nKatakuri returns to Luffy\u0027s location. They both agree that the spectators watching them are a little too boisterous for their tastes. The two pirates then unleash a combined blast of Haki des Rois, knocking out Flampe and all his subordinates. Before fainting, Flampe expresses his amazement that Luffy can also use the Haki of Kings!\n\nMeanwhile, en route to Liqueur Island, the Nostra Castello is still being pursued by Big Mom, who flies over the sea on Prometheus\u0027 back. But Prometheus, now too enormous, is unable to catch up with Capone Bege\u0027s crew, especially as the latter has on board the wedding cake so coveted by the mistress of Whole Cake Island, a serious asset that prevents Big Mom\u0027s fleet from attacking them. What\u0027s more, Bege and his men are nearing their destination. As they finally come within sight of Liqueur Island, Capone congratulates his crew on having repaired the ship\u0027s paddlewheels in time. Vito and Bege suggest leaving the cake on the island of their next destination, but Chiffon thinks that Liqueur Island isn\u0027t far enough from Cacao Island, and that they should head for Moelleuse Island instead. She fears that if they leave the cake on Liqueur Island, Big Mom will quickly come to her senses and have enough time to catch up with Nami and the others on Cocoa Island. Bege suddenly caught sight of Big Mom, who had become very thin as a result of her hunger. She leers hungrily at the cake stored on the deck of the Nostra Castello. Chiffon\u0027s mind is made up, and she will do anything to pay her debt to the Straw Hats, even at the risk of her own life, despite her husband\u0027s reluctance. The latter is finally convinced by his wife and orders his men to change course immediately.\n\nNot far away, on the Thousand Sunny, Sanji takes leave of his friends to fly with Pudding on Rabian to reach Cocoa Island as quickly as possible. At the same time, Carrot woke up and came out of her cabin to ask her comrades what had happened while she was asleep. Chopper takes advantage of her presence to congratulate her and asks if Dukes Inuarashi and Nekomamushi also become very strong when they observe the full moon. Carrot confirms this, while Charlotte Smoothie\u0027s fleet is still hot on their heels. Suddenly, Charlotte Smoothie launches an attack, and Jinbei has time to change tack to avoid the Sunny being hit. He asks Nami to tell him where the next attacks will take place. Aboard Smoothie\u0027s ship, Smoothie has grown very tall after stabbing her men with her sword to extract their life force. Her sisters, Lemon and Cinnamon, ask her to stop, but Smoothie has her way. She has every intention of stopping the Straw Hats, even if it means putting her entire crew to the sword. Meanwhile, on the Sunny\u0027s forecastle, Nami and Brook are amazed at how big Smoothie has become. The living skeleton even wonders if they\u0027re dealing with a giantess. Suddenly, Smoothie launches another attack. Nami has just enough time to order Jinbei to turn to port to avoid being hit. Smoothie launches a third and then a fourth attack, each of which is parried by the Fishman, provoking Smoothie\u0027s fury. Drunk with rage, Smoothie continues to grow, at the risk of sinking her own ship! She then launches a new attack with her much more devastating sword, splitting the waves to destroy her enemies. However, Jinbei\u0027s helming skills save the day for the Straw Hats by turning to port. This action sends Sunny flying over the raging waves, once again provoking Smoothie\u0027s wrath.\n\nMeanwhile, back in Mirror World, Flampe and his men have lost all knowledge of Luffy and Katakuri\u0027s combined Haki des Rois. Katakuri apologizes for being so careless with Katakuri, saying he should have noticed Flampe\u0027s poisoned needles. Luffy replies that there\u0027s no such thing as fair play in a pirate duel, but that it was up to him to be more vigilant. Suddenly, Katakuri removes his jacket and reveals his bare torso covered in tattoos before getting into fighting position. The two men stare at each other for a long moment. Katakuri finally reveals to Luffy that he no longer considers him a weaker fighter than he is, and that he was wrong about him. The two men prepare to face off once more. Luffy declares that he will always be victorious; and with that, he launches into a furious attack, while Katakuri also jumps into the fray. Running at each other, the two pirates face off in a duel to the death, even if the Straw Hat has very little chance of defeating his ruthless adversary. However, with rage in his heart, Luffy goes on the offensive, inflicting a heavy defeat on Katakuri by punching him in the face. A titanic battle was about to begin between the two pirates...",

        "description": "Luffy and Katakuri engage in another fierce battle, more ferocious than the last. Haki against Haki, the two pirates clash with savagery. The Straw Hat manages to dodge all his opponent\u0027s attacks and swears he\u0027s going to take him down. But he hasn\u0027t reached Katakuri\u0027s level, and as Katakuri rushes towards him, the Straw Hat closes his eyes and clears his mind. He sees his enemy\u0027s attack and parries it with ease. As the fight progresses, Luffy\u0027s level of perception increases, and he\u0027s able to anticipate Katakuri\u0027s blows, who attacks him without hesitation. But Luffy doesn\u0027t give in and defends himself as best he can.\nAs he fought, Luffy remembered the training he had undergone with Silvers Rayleigh on the island of Ruskaina. The former right-hand man of Gol D. Roger taught the future King of Pirates that every attack has a purpose, an aura. Rayleigh trained his pupil so hard that he forbade him to eat. One evening, as Luffy lay starving on the ground, several of the island\u0027s animals heard his stomach growl and came forward with food to satiate his hunger. But the Straw Hat refused their gifts, preferring to fight with the jungle animals to perfect his fighting tactics. Some time later, Rayleigh continued to teach Luffy the Haki of Observation, revealing that it can be used to predict the movements of others, and even catch glimpses of the future.\n\nBack in the present, Luffy continues to fight Katakuri, but has to let go of his enemy\u0027s attack. As his opponent prepares to attack again, Luffy delves into his memories and recalls Rayleigh\u0027s words that his Observation Haki allows him to sense the feelings of people and animals. However, his mentor doubted that these two years of intensive training would be enough for Luffy if he had to face formidable enemies capable of glimpsing the future. Luffy replies that he\u0027ll see when the time comes, and that it will depend on the opponent he\u0027s fighting, i.e. on his personality. Rayleigh admits that he has never considered this aspect, but that he will do his best to ensure that his pupil is able to use his power without the slightest limit. As his battle with Katakuri progresses, Luffy is able to read his opponent\u0027s future attacks and dodge them. Then he charges Katakuri, but the latter manages to hit Luffy, who manages to block his other attacks, injuring his hands in the process. The two fighters are met with violent blows from both Luffy and Katakuri. But Luffy is thrown backwards, as Katakuri throws his right arm at him. As Katakuri rebuilds his arm, Luffy suddenly charges at him and punches him in the face, before continuing to exchange blows with each other without slowing down. At the end of this pugilistic encounter, the pirates are exhausted but not ready to stop fighting. Indeed, a new duel begins between the two men.\n\nMeanwhile, Sanji and Pudding make their way to Cacao Island on Rabian, the young woman\u0027s flying carpet, accompanied by Nitro. The young cook thanks Pudding for helping him, which seems to excite her. Sanji has every intention of rescuing Luffy when he comes to Cocoa Island, which is currently surrounded by Big Mom\u0027s huge fleet. In fact, Oven, who is in charge of the blockade, is assisted by his many brothers and sisters from the Charlotte Family, including Brownie, Joconde, Chiboust, Raisin, Yuen and Myukuru, who all joined him at 11:36 p.m. to intercept the Straw Hat Crew on the island, including the tenfolders and former Sweet Commander Snack. All have taken their places in front of the island\u0027s only intact mirror. They\u0027re ready to give Luffy a proper welcome.

        "description": "In the Mirror World, Katakuri is getting impatient and can\u0027t wait to finish off Luffy. Luffy gets to his feet and takes up his challenge. At the limit of their strength, the two fighters look at each other and Luffy remembers his training with Rayleigh. It was thanks to her teaching that the Straw Hat had managed to reach the level of Gear Fourth and develop it by facing his master.\nBack to the present. Luffy unveils his new Gear Fourth form, Snakeman, before his opponent\u0027s eyes. This new form slims him down and inflates his arms and legs a little, and he claims it makes him much faster. He proves this by attacking Katakuri with full force, without the latter even realizing it. However, his opponent had come to understand Luffy\u0027s strategy, attacking him from all sides with his \u0022Python\u0022 attack. That\u0027s why Katakuri had failed to anticipate and dodge his latest attack. However, he swears he won\u0027t let it happen next time.\n\nHaving understood Luffy\u0027s attack, Katakuri avoids his second charge, but Luffy tells him that by stretching his arm, he increases the power of the attack, so there\u0027s no point in dodging it. He then hits him again from the front with his \u0022Culverin Jet\u0022 technique, and Katakuri is propelled backwards.\n\nKatakuri manages to dodge Luffy\u0027s third charge, and a veritable game of cat and mouse ensues between the two combatants, with Katakuri, transformed into a giant donut, rolling to avoid being caught by Luffy\u0027s elastic arms. However, Katakuri regains the upper hand and delivers a violent blow to his opponent, transforming his right arm into a huge club with the \u0022Zangiri Mochi\u0022 attack. Luffy finds himself trapped on Katakuri\u0027s arm, which is enveloped in Weapon\u0027s Haki, and Katakuri takes advantage of this to spin him around to stun him, ending up violently propelling Luffy to the ground.\n\nAt the same time, Pudding and Sanji, accompanied by Nitro, fly over the sea on Rabian and are soon in sight of Cocoa Island. The young cook scans the horizon with binoculars and orders the magic carpet to stop. Braking so quickly, Pudding loses her balance and Sanji catches her in extremis before she falls into the water. Pudding asserts her bipolar personality by ordering Sanji to let her go. Sanji complies and, taking his binoculars, sees Big Mom\u0027s huge fleet blockading the island. He then passes the binoculars to Pudding, who reveals that his big brother Charlotte Oven is in charge of the whole operation. He has assembled all the Charlotte Family commanders to apprehend the Straw Hats. Sanji and Pudding decide to land on Cocoa Island unseen to avoid any trouble. Flying over the waves and camouflaged by Nitro, Pudding and Sanji manage to land on the island unnoticed after flying low under the noses of the soldiers guarding the ships.\n\nIn the Mirror Word, Katakuri delivers a heavy blow to Luffy, who finds himself buried at the bottom of a huge hole. Thinking he has triumphed over his adversary, Big Mom\u0027s son sees the Straw Hat emerge from the depths, more wounded than ever. A fierce new battle ensues between the two pirates. Luffy throws a flurry of punches at his adversary. The captain of the Straw Hat Crew and Big Mom\u0027s son throw a series of equally violent blows at each other, and both fighters are eventually pushed back. Luffy then unleashes his \u0022Mamba Black\u0022 attack, but Katakuri manages to dodge and repel him before charging at him, resuming his doughnut form. At the turning point of their duel, the two men are now determined to end the fight, and each is preparing to do so on his own.\n\nMeanwhile, on the Sabaody Archipelago, Shakky and Silvers Rayleigh worry about Luffy\u0027s fate, hoping he\u0027ll pull through. In the Mirror World, the confrontation reaches its climax when Luffy sends out his \u0022King Cobra\u0022 attack, while Katakuri counters with his \u0022Zangiri Mochi\u0022 technique...",

        "description": "In the Mirror World, the battle between Luffy and Katakuri reached its climax. For her part, Br\u00fbl\u00e9e managed to free herself from her bonds at 00:25. Confident in her brother\u0027s ability to defeat Luffy, she leaves to join Charlotte Oven, knowing that the Straw Hat needs her help to get out of the Mirror World.\nMeanwhile, on Cacao Island, heavily guarded by Big Mom\u0027s entire fleet, it\u0027s 00:28. One of the Charlotte Decupl\u00e9s wonders about the odds of Katakuri losing his fight with Luffy, but is quickly rebuked by his siblings. Even Oven asserts that the chances of him losing are nil. Still, some are surprised that the fight lasts so long. Charlotte Raisin thinks Luffy will try to capture Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, and the rest of Big Mom\u0027s crew agrees with this possibility. Unbeknownst to them, Sanji is hiding in a nearby alley. He lights a cigarette and notes with concern that if Luffy can\u0027t escape Big Mom\u0027s fleet when he comes out, it\u0027ll be the end of them both, especially as there\u0027s only one intact mirror left on the island through which Luffy could borrow it to return to the real world. He tells Pudding, who is sitting further down the alley, that they\u0027ll have to separate when Luffy comes out. Sanji remembers the unorthodox circumstances of their meeting and wedding, but thanks Pudding for helping him make a new wedding cake for his mother. For her part, the girl would like to apologize; but her demonic side gets the better of her, for she still schemed against him and intended to murder him a few days earlier. However, Sanji doesn\u0027t hold it against her - they are enemies after all - and tells her he\u0027s glad she was his bride. Pudding starts to cry and tells Sanji that she has one last favor to ask of him before taking the cigarette from his lips and kissing him.\n\nAt the same time, at 00:37, in Br\u00fbl\u00e9e\u0027s Mirror World, Luffy and Katakuri both send their final attacks. The ground beneath Luffy collapses and he falls unconscious when his Gear Fourth deactivates. Shortly afterwards, Katakuri collapses on his stomach having reached the end of his strength. It\u0027s 00:40 on Whole Cake Island. Morgans hopes that the Crew of the Straw Hat will manage to escape from Totto Land Archipelago, to make it an unprecedented scoop, which greatly upsets Charlotte Mont d\u0027Or. He assures Morgans that their fleet will crush the Straw Hats, saying that even Gol D. Roger wouldn\u0027t be able to escape in the face of this terrible armada. He even tells Morgans that he\u0027s counting on him to do a story worthy of what\u0027s going to happen tomorrow, when they finally capture the Straw Hats. They\u0027ll behead them and line up their heads to make an example of them. Stussy suddenly intervenes and takes offense at Mont d\u0027Or\u0027s sudden brutality.\n\nAt 00:43, the Nostra Castello is still being pursued by Big Mom and Prometheus, who are close enough to start setting her on fire. The members of the Fire Tank Crew beg their captain to put down the cake in order to escape, but Bege tells them that now is not the time to give in, and that they must stand united in the face of death. Suddenly, Chiffon warns the entire crew that Funwari Island is in sight by pointing his binoculars in its direction. This news rekindles the hearts of Bege\u0027s men, who believe that their last hour has not yet come.\n\nAt 00:45, the Straw Hats, still hot on the heels of Charlotte Smoothie\u0027s fleet, are about to reach Cocoa Island at the appointed time. But they\u0027re worried about their captain, because even if he wins, he won\u0027t be able to get out of the mirror world without Br\u00fbl\u00e9e\u0027s help. And yet, they all have faith in Luffy!\n\nAt 00:47, in Mirror World, Luffy regains consciousness and pulls himself out of the abyss into which he had fallen. As he crawls towards Katakuri, he thinks back to the words spoken by Nami, for he still has the rendezvous time in mind. However, his enemy suddenly rises to his feet and stands straight in front of him. The Sweet Commander asks his opponent if he\u0027ll ever return to defeat Big Mom, and Luffy nods, saying he\u0027ll become the next Pirate Lord. Katakuri adds that Luffy can see far into the future, then blood gushes from the wound on his chest. As Luffy looks on in surprise, he falls unconscious onto his back. The young pirate then places the hat that protected his straw hat over Katakuri\u0027s mouth as a sign of farewell before leaving. As he staggered forward, he noticed, to his horror, that Br\u00fbl\u00e9e had escaped. He can\u0027t leave the Mirror World without her help. Suddenly, he hears Br\u00fbl\u00e9e\u0027s shrill cries as she sees her older brother defeated. She had been captured and tied up by Pekoms, who had disguised himself as \u0022Nazoms\u0022. He had brought her to Luffy to help him get out of Mirror World, because he wants to honor Pedro\u0027s memory by helping the Straw Hats escape.\n\nAt 00:50, the Straw Hats, aboard the Thousand Sunny, are finally in sight of Cocoa Island, but Sanji warns them via snail phone not to get too close to Big Mom\u0027s Crew fleet, while promising that he\u0027ll bring Luffy back no matter what. At 00:55, Oven and his men are ready to fight, while the Fire Tank Crew are just a short distance from their island. The Straw Hats, for their part, obey Sanji\u0027s orders and don\u0027t board Cacao Island just yet. Meanwhile, clinging to Pekoms\u0027 shoulder, Luffy prepares to pass through a mirror with the power of Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, unaware of what awaits him on the other side...",

        "description": "On Cacao Island, Charlotte Oven\u0027s men anxiously await the arrival of the Straw Hat through the looking glass. Four minutes before the rendezvous time, the Thousand Sunny appears off the island and the alarm is sounded. For their part, the Straw Hats watch in awe as the huge fleet of Big Mom\u0027s Crew awaits them on the island\u0027s shores. A few pie ships set out to sink the Sunny. Jinbei informs his friends that they are facing the \u0022Imperial Fleet\u0022. Behind them, Smoothie\u0027s subordinates ask him what they should do now. Their leader replies that they must reinforce the fleet at the rear, to ensure that the Straw Hats are completely surrounded. Meanwhile, on Whole Cake Island, with three minutes to go, Charlotte Mont d\u0027Or orders one of his subordinates to put him in communication with his allies on Cocoa Island via a snail phone.\nBack on Cocoa Island, the Charlotte D\u00e9cupl\u00e9s are ready to do battle with Luffy, as are all Charlotte Oven\u0027s men. In the shadows, Sanji also awaits his friend\u0027s arrival two minutes before the rendezvous time. Oven\u0027s army starts brandishing their weapons and shouting in anticipation of Luffy\u0027s arrival.\n\nMeanwhile, in Mirror World, Pekoms tells Luffy about his Sulong form. He reveals that he can only master it if Pedro is there to talk to him and calm him down. Indeed, only Pedro\u0027s soothing voice makes him react when he\u0027s in this form. He then unveils his plan to help Luffy and his companions escape from Cacao Island, with the aim of fulfilling Pedro\u0027s last wish. He plans to distract Big Mom\u0027s pirates with his Sulong form, so that Luffy can escape. Tied up, Br\u00fbl\u00e9e accuses him of being a traitor and tells him his plan won\u0027t work, but Pekoms intervenes and tells him to shut up.\n\nOn Cacao Island, Br\u00fbl\u00e9e\u0027s cries of distress are heard outside Mirror World. As the snipers prepare to fire, Pekoms steps out of the mirror and uses Br\u00fbl\u00e9e as a human shield. Unfortunately, to his surprise, he is recognized by everyone despite his disguise; then Big Mom\u0027s pirates ask him why it was he who came out of the mirror and not Luffy or Katakuri. Pekoms tells them not to move, threatening to kill Br\u00fbl\u00e9e by burning his brains out. Then he takes off his glasses to look up at the full moon, ignoring Big Mom\u0027s Crew\u0027s cries of terror for him to stop before he turns into Sulong. Enraged by the latter\u0027s betrayal, Oven uses his Demon Fruit to burn Pekoms\u0027 hand and uses his Heat Wave Fist attack to interrupt his transformation. Pekoms, seriously wounded, is thrown into the air, then crashes heavily to the ground, releasing Br\u00fbl\u00e9e and freeing Luffy, who was hidden under his clothes. Sanji, who witnesses the scene, is relieved to find his friend alive.\n\nAt the same time, off Cacao Island, the Sunny comes under fire from Big Mom\u0027s immense armada. Jinbei uses his helming skills to prevent his ship from being hit. In the midst of this tumult, Chopper receives a snail phone call from Sanji, who informs him that Luffy has won his fight against Katakuri. The Straw Hats are drunk with joy at the news. However, Luffy finds himself surrounded by Big Mom\u0027s Pirates. He has no choice but to fight, even though he is no longer fit to do so. Luffy tries to escape by jumping onto the roof of a nearby house. But he is intercepted by Raisin, who pulls out his katana to attack him. However, Sanji jumps out of hiding and saves his captain from certain death by kicking Raisin, who ends up in a house. Sanji then grabs Luffy and asks him if he\u0027s won his fight. Luffy nods before falling asleep in his arms. The two men try to escape through the sky with the Pas de Lune technique. Oven finds them naive and says they had planned for this eventuality. Indeed, some of Big Mom\u0027s pirates use the same technique to counter them. Meanwhile, on the ground, Pekoms straightens up and stares again at the full moon to complete his transformation into Sulong. He succeeds and helps Sanji and Luffy by defeating many of their enemies. But, now out of control, he strikes Sanji and Luffy, who crash into the roof of a house without understanding what has happened to them. Just as he was about to hit Sanji, Pekoms heard Pedro\u0027s voice in his head telling him to calm down. As if by magic, it worked. And Pekoms asked the cook to take the Straw Hat to safety.\n\nAs the two pirates fled, Pekoms continued to wreak havoc on Big Mom\u0027s crew. Attacked from all sides, the Mink comes under attack from Raisin, then, on Oven\u0027s orders, his body is pierced by hundreds of spears. Big Mom\u0027s son orders that Pekoms\u0027s eyes be gouged out so that he can never again look at the glow of the full moon and use his Sulong form. Distracted by Pekoms\u0027 cries of agony, Sanji and Luffy are attacked by Yuen and end up on the ground. They are soon surrounded by enemy pirates trying to kill them.\n\nSuddenly, an explosion sounds in the harbor, attracting the attention of everyone, including the occupants of the Sunny. A pirate reports to Snack that the fleet attacking them is none other than the Germa 66. Big Mom\u0027s pirates are very surprised by this turn of events, as it was claimed that the members of the Germa 66 had been killed a few hours ago. The Germa Kingdom fleet prepares for another offensive, as Yonji, Niji, Ichiji and Reiju each don their battle gear. All four then launch an assault just as Big Mom\u0027s pirates are ducking Sanji and Luffy. The Vinsmoke stop the bullets and protect Luffy and Sanji with their bodies. Ichiji ironically thanks Big Mom\u0027s crew for taking such good care of them at the Tea Party, then tells them that they too will leave them a little souvenir...",

Ichiji orders Sanji to take Luffy and leave the island immediately. For his part, Oven wonders what happened to the 10,000-strong army commanded by Nusstorte, the 12th son of the Charlotte Family. Ichiji replies that his army has defeated them all, claiming that they can\u0027t surpass their technology, which is far better than their own.\nMeanwhile, near Whole Cake Ch\u00e2teau, Charlotte Mont-d\u0027Or desperately tries to contact Nusstorte, defeated by Germa 66 and floating miserably on the sea, but to no avail. Nearby, Tamago panics at the turn of events.\n\nOn Cacao Island, Sanji takes advantage of Germa 66\u0027s unexpected arrival to escape by air, taking Luffy, who was still asleep, with him. But Big Mom\u0027s pirates wouldn\u0027t let him get away, strafing him relentlessly from the air. His brothers and sister immediately come to his rescue and, thanks to their sophisticated combat outfits, stop the bullets before they reach him. They then encourage him to flee, while Jajji, though wounded, orders his men to strafe the island and decimate Big Mom\u0027s fleet.\n\nNear the coast of Cacao Island, Smoothie and her sisters watch the carnage. Big Mom\u0027s 14th daughter orders her troops to stay on course, reminding them that their priority remains the capture of the Straw Hat Crew. She is soon joined on deck by Daifuku, who castigates Mont d\u0027Or\u0027s disastrous handling of events. He also criticizes the attitude of his sister, who stubbornly continues to pursue the fugitives instead of surrounding them. Meanwhile, aboard the Thousand Sunny, Nami asks Jinbei why Germa 66 is on their side when they\u0027re enemies, before being contacted by Sanji, who instructs them, via snail phone, to sail along the harbor of Cocoa Island at full speed to catch him and Luffy in the act.\n\nAt the same time, Sanji, carrying Luffy on his shoulder, makes his way by neutralizing all the Big Mom pirates who cross his path, running breathlessly while dodging bullets. For her part, Br\u00fbl\u00e9e reveals to everyone that Luffy has indeed defeated Katakuri. The news is greeted with incredulity and indignation, as no one had considered the possibility that the Sweet Commander, reputedly invincible, could be defeated by a second-rate pirate like Luffy. For his part, Sanji takes advantage of his enemies\u0027 confusion to flee. Oven, shocked by his brother\u0027s defeat, orders his men to shoot Sanji and Luffy. The Straw Hat crew\u0027s cook manages to dodge all the attacks, but a bullet wounds his left shoulder. He falls heavily to the ground with Luffy before getting up to run harder, still pursued by Oven\u0027s men. Oven takes the lead, grabbing his flaming sword to attack Luffy and Sanji. The latter are lost when they discover they are surrounded. However, Ichiji steps in and saves the day before the astonished eyes of his brother, who had noticed that all the members of the Vinsmoke Family had changed their attitude towards him. His older brother orders Sanji to escape into the sky. While he\u0027s in the air, Charlotte Yuen stands in his way and tries to attack Sanji, but Yonji intervenes by shattering Yuen\u0027s orb before catching him on the head and hurling him against the buildings. Having struck down his opponent, Yonji encourages his brother to continue fleeing as quickly as possible.\n\nAs Sanji escapes by air, several snipers try to shoot him down in mid-air, one of them preparing a missile, but Niji flies in and catches Sanji just as the explosion goes off. While holding on to Sanji and Luffy, Niji moves at high speed and eliminates several pirates with his electric sword, which strikes down his enemies. Big Mom\u0027s pirates are incredulous that the Straw Hats can escape them so easily. Niji throws Sanji and Luffy towards the port. Sanji resumes his flight towards Sunny. While en route, he is targeted by men stationed on the pie ships. Just then, Reiju arrives and neutralizes them by poisoning them. Then she goes to her younger brother\u0027s rescue before he is disintegrated by a barrage of fire. Sanji sees her close by and thanks her for her help. When they were out of range, Reiju let Sanji go and joined her brothers in their fight against Big Mom\u0027s pirates. For his part, Sanji never forgot what his family had done for him and continued to flee, gaining altitude. As expected, Sanji and Luffy arrived at just the right moment when the Sunny was sailing alongside the island\u0027s harbor. Carrot spotted them from the lookout and told his companions the good news. In the air, Sanji saw his ship sailing at full speed and couldn\u0027t help thinking that he and Luffy would soon be saved...",

In the midst of this tumult, Sanji makes his way to the Sunny while carrying Luffy, who is still asleep, on his back. From the lookout, Carrot can see his friend through his binoculars. The cook avoids enemy fire and lands safely on the deck of his ship. There, all his companions give him a warm welcome. The Straw Hat wakes up and Chopper asks him if he had beaten Katakuri. Luffy replies in the affirmative, before going right back to sleep. While the little reindeer tends to his captain\u0027s wounds, the Sunny\u0027s occupants fend off Smoothie\u0027s ranged attacks, while she and her fleet close in on them. Nami has no choice but to escape by picking up speed.\nMeanwhile, on Nuts Island, the citizens of Peanuts Town, despite Amande\u0027s help, mourn the destruction of their town following Big Mom\u0027s crisis. At the same time, on Crunchy Island, the inhabitants are losing hope, saying that not even Pudding can make the same Streusen cake in such a short time. Cutlery Islanders prepare to escape, as do Ice Islanders who learn that the cake is on Funwari Island. The inhabitants of the surrounding towns flee in fear, thinking that they will suffer the same fate as Nuts Island. Meanwhile, Chiffon and Bege witness the destruction of the Nostra Castello, which sinks before their very eyes. The Fire Tank\u0027s crew chief has no desire to know what will become of the Totto Land Archipelago. But Chiffon refuses to leave, entrusting him with their son Pez, as she is in charge of Funwari Island and wants to wait for his mother. Her mother soon arrives.\n\nNot far away, in Sweet City, Mont d\u0027Or frantically calls Perospero for information about Big Mom and the wedding cake. Bavarois answers by snail phone, revealing that Perospero\u0027s health is gradually deteriorating because he had taken too long to treat his wounds. Perospero takes the snail phone and tells Mont d\u0027Or that Chiffon and Bege have abandoned the cake on Funwari Island. He then tells him to alert the citizens of Totto Land Archipelago to these three eventualities when Big Mom goes to eat the cake: if the cake is poisoned and the Empress dies, that will be the end of Big Mom\u0027s Crew; if, on the other hand, Big Mom survives a poisoning attempt, but doesn\u0027t like the cake, she will continue to unleash her wrath and destroy all the islands of the Totto Land Archipelago; the last eventuality and the only way for them to survive is for Big Mom to find the cake delicious. Mont d\u0027Or asserts that the citizens already know this and wonders where Stussy and Morgans are now. He learns that they\u0027ve left the island, which irritates him. He orders his subordinates to capture them to prevent them from revealing to the world what had happened on Big Mom\u0027s territory.\n\nOn Funwari Island, Chiffon confides in her husband that she trusts Sanji\u0027s culinary skills and that Big Mom will succumb to happiness when she eats the wedding cake. For his part, Bege orders his subordinates Vito and Gotti to immediately find a boat and leave the island as soon as possible. He\u0027ll try to escape with his wife, hoping that the Straw Hats won\u0027t die, after all they\u0027ve done for them. For her part, Big Mom jumps off Prometheus to attack the cake with Napoleon. Before the horrified eyes of Chiffon and Bege, the Empress prepares to devour the wedding cake.\n\nMeanwhile, off Cocoa Island, thanks to Jinbei\u0027s helming skills, the Sunny narrowly avoids being shot at by Big Mom\u0027s fleet, who continue to pursue them. But their advance is halted by the attack of the Germa 66 fleet, commanded by Vinsmoke Judge. For his part, Daifuku orders his ships to ignore them, as he knows that almost the entire Germa 66 fleet is in the harbor. Sanji and Judge\u0027s eyes suddenly meet, and Judge asks Luffy why he saved Sanji, listing all the reasons why the latter was, in his eyes, weak-minded and a good-for-nothing. However, Luffy thanks Judge for helping them escape. Then, out of confusion, he asks Sanji why his father has taken to praising his qualities, which makes Jinbei laugh out loud. Climbing back to the top of the lookout, Carrot alerts the crew, shouting that Big Mom\u0027s pirate fleet has gathered in front of them to pincer them. Suddenly, the enemy fleet attacks the Sunny with cannonballs, and Daifuku\u0027s genie approaches to attack Carrot. However, Sanji intervenes and blocks the genie\u0027s attack. Daifuku and Smoothie say they\u0027re putting so much pressure on the Straw Hats that they\u0027re on the verge of harassment. At the same time, the battleships of Big Mom\u0027s fleet are moving rapidly towards the Sunny, and Jinbe is losing hope. Just as all seemed lost, the sea beneath Big Mom\u0027s fleet suddenly swelled, and the Sunny\u0027s occupants saw Wadatsumi rise from the sea and sweep away several enemy ships with a wave of his hand. The Straw Hats recognize their strange savior as a former member of Hody Jones\u0027 crew. Jinbei suddenly dives underwater and discovers the entire Sun Pirates crew, who pledge to serve their former captain until he escapes unharmed from Totto Land Archipelago...",

        "description": "On Funwari Island, the inhabitants flee just as Big Mom is about to eat the wedding cake in front of Chiffon and Capone Bege. Capone Bege begs his wife to leave, but Chiffon has her way. Bege pulls out all the stops and whisks her away just as Big Mom approaches the huge wedding cake with a greedy look in her eyes. The Empress is watched by Perospero, who is worried about her mother. Is this the end of Big Mom or Totto Land Archipelago? Like the rest of the Charlotte Family, everyone holds their breath when Big Mom starts eating gluttonously.\nAs she flees, swept away by Bege, Chiffon remembers being annoyed by Sanji\u0027s carefree confidence when they were preparing the cake, but she now realizes his great abilities as a cook. For her part, Big Mom falls into a swoon after taking her first bites, which worries Perospero. Seeing that Big Mom has fallen over backwards, Charlotte Bavarois orders a rescue team to the island, but her brother objects. Perospero had noticed that his mother was shedding tears of joy as she loudly proclaimed that this was the wedding cake she wanted. Everyone learns that Big Mom\u0027s crisis has passed. Bavarois wonders if the cake is poisoned; Perospero is sure of it, but thinks it\u0027s ineffective against Big Mom. As for Chiffon, she\u0027s happy to see the satisfied look on her mother\u0027s face, just as Sanji had predicted. Big Mom is ecstatic and can\u0027t help expressing her joy by singing. For his part, Perospero takes advantage of this moment of calm to contact all the inhabitants of Totto Land Archipelago and announce that the Big Mom crisis has passed; news that delights everyone. Pudding is cheered for having supposedly baked the cake, then hears the citizens congratulating her in an alley on Cocoa Island, and thinks to herself that she hasn\u0027t done anything after all. The real hero is Sanji, whose kindness and greatness had made the world\u0027s best cake.\n\nAt the same time, at the bottom of the sea, Jinbei is cheered by the members of the Sun Pirates Crew, who have all come to bid farewell to their former captain. Aladdin then invites him to return to the Straw Hats, as he intends to open the way for their friends to escape. Jinbei obeys and returns aboard the Sunny. He is pleased that his former companions have helped him, and realizes that it was they who had confused their position. For his part, Wadatsumi sweeps away all the enemy ships with a wave of his hand, while the Fish-Men sink them by piercing their hulls with their spears. Soon, they are attacking Big Mom\u0027s Pirates. Annoyed, Daifuku launches his genie to capture the Straw Hats. He is stopped in his tracks by Aladdin, who attacks him using Gyojin Karate. Nami and her friends are astonished to see that a passageway has formed in front of them, large enough to escape. They take advantage of this opportunity while the members of the Sun Pirate Crew hold off their attackers for as long as possible.\n\nMeanwhile, Germa 66 has a run-in with Big Mom\u0027s crew. For her part, Charlotte Oven emerges from a mirror on one of the fleet\u0027s ships, and reports to the crew that Br\u00fbl\u00e9e has just brought in new ammunition that is effective against Germa 66\u0027s forces. Family member Charlotte says he can\u0027t forgive Luffy for defeating his brother Katakuri, and launches a violent attack on the Straw Hats. Not far away, off Cacao Island, Big Mom\u0027s forces bombard Germa\u0027s Kingdom and attempt to penetrate it. But they are stopped by Judge, who swears that no one will enter his home. Not far away, his children inflict a humiliating beating on Big Mom\u0027s men.\n\nFor her part, Charlotte Oven puts her hands in the ocean and boils the water with the abilities of her Demon Fruit, the Netsu Netsu no Mi. The heat reaches the position of the Straw Hats and the Sun Pirates. The latter are forced by the heat to retreat underwater to escape the scorching temperatures. Soon, the Sunny finds itself once again surrounded by the enemy fleet. Its occupants are at a loss as to what to do, and ask Luffy for advice. Luffy steps forward and orders them to keep moving, whatever the cost. Meanwhile, on Whole Cake Island, Charlotte Mont d\u0027Or learns that the Queen Mama Chanter will soon be arriving.\n\nAs Big Mom continues to eat the cake, she begins to sing, searching for words to describe a cake whose delicious taste she can barely comprehend. On Cacao Island, the Queen Mama Chanter battles the Thousand Sunny, while the Vinsmoke Family is swamped by numerous pirates armed with the new ammunition from Big Mom\u0027s crew. Big Mom recalls memories through the cake, such as her sixth birthday party, and then realizes that the cake she\u0027s eating now tastes just like the famous croquembouche she ate on her birthday. She expresses a desire to share a meal with her family one day, and talks about Mother Caramel\u0027s dream of creating a utopia in the Totto Land Archipelago where all races could live together. While Big Mom was in the midst of her fantasy, her crew attacked the Thousand Sunny from all sides, eventually sinking it in a violent explosion...",

The news of their defeat is relayed throughout the Totto Land Archipelago and on Whole Cake Island, where Charlotte Mont d\u0027Or congratulates her brothers and sisters on this immense victory that will go down in history. Meanwhile, on Funwari Island, Big Mom had finished eating the huge wedding cake that Sanji had prepared for her. She lay on the floor, still in ecstasy from the sheer delight she had tasted. Beside her, Prometheus tried to reason with her, but to no avail. Her eldest son, Perospero, is also beside her with Charlotte Bavarois. Both discover that she is rested and happy, then think that it\u0027s thanks to Pudding that Big Mom is in this state. They thank their little sister for what she had done. Perospero tries to brief her on the situation, but her mother won\u0027t listen.\nNot far away, off Cacao Island, Big Mom\u0027s immense fleet admires the huge blaze of what used to be the Thousand Sunny slowly sinking in the middle of the ocean. Suddenly, Smoothie is shocked to discover that it\u0027s the wrong ship that\u0027s sinking. It was indeed that of the Sun Pirates Crew! How did such a switch happen? It was thanks to the intervention of Wadatsumi, who had swapped the Sunny with the ship Fisher Tiger had built with his own hands, just in time. Now, the Straw Hat\u0027s ship lay in Wadatsumi\u0027s huge mouth, plunging into the depths of the sea, guided by Aladdin and his Fishmen. However, their adversaries had discovered the deception and decided to give chase. Their paddle steamers set to work as Charlotte Oven plunges her hot hands into the sea to boil it. His technique works, as he succeeds in severely wounding Wadatsumi. The sea monk suddenly rises to the surface and spits out Sunny, who flies into the air. Luffy and his friends once again find themselves under fire from Big Mom\u0027s immense armada. But Wadatsumi pulls himself up and uses his body as a shield to defend the Straw Hats from enemy fire. The giant sailor then asks his friends to forgive him for being so nasty on Fish Island, and admits that he was able to restore his honor when Jinbei agreed to take him with him. For his part, Oven is furious. He throws burning rays at poor Wadatsumi to make him step aside, but the sea monk still resists. With cries of pain, he confesses that the entire crew of the Sun Pirates are ready to sacrifice themselves to allow Jinbei to leave safely. Suddenly, Aladdin and his men emerge from the water under the admiring gazes of Luffy and Jinbei. Jinbei is urged to flee by his former lieutenant, who will take charge of the fight against Big Mom\u0027s forces, who are still reeling from such a turn of events.\n\nThe Sunny\u0027s occupants take advantage of the situation to flee under full sail, while behind them they hear the clamor of battle. The Fish-Men are fighting like mad against a force a thousand times greater. Charlotte Oven doesn\u0027t give in and attacks the Straw Hats again. Aladdin stops him, however, and a duel ensues. Meanwhile, Daifuku, allied with her sister Smoothie, wipes out a large number of Fishmen before Jinbei\u0027s helpless eyes. Jinbei can\u0027t bear to watch any more. He orders his friends to pump out the seawater in Sunny\u0027s holds, as she\u0027s sailing too slowly, and to quickly repair the mainsail. Indeed, it will take them several hours to leave Big Mom\u0027s territory and be out of danger. These recommendations surprise Luffy, who asks Jinbei what he has in mind. Jinbei tells him he can\u0027t abandon his former companions to their fate, and decides to fight with them. The Straw Hat doesn\u0027t want to stop him and plans to stay behind. But Jinbei refuses, and solemnly announces that he and the Fishmen will cover their backs while they flee. He promises that he\u0027ll succeed and come back alive. Luffy agrees. He reminds him, however, that he\u0027s now his captain and it\u0027s in his best interest to arrive safely in the Land of Wa, where he\u0027ll be waiting for him. Jinbei agrees, bowing positively to his captain, who forbids him to die before their reunion.\n\nAt the same time, Big Mom has recovered her senses and leaves Funwari Island with Perospero. She asks her son if the Straw Hat is still alive. He replies that he is. This answer didn\u0027t anger the Empress. Quite the contrary, in fact. Sailing on a candy frog, she plans to capture Luffy\u0027s soul and turn him into a vicious Homie. Capone Bege sees them through the binoculars and congratulates himself on having escaped in time by stealing a pie ship. His wife, Chiffon, is beside him with their son Pez, hoping that her friend Nami will escape unharmed.\n\nAs they escape, Big Mom\u0027s fleet continues to machine-gun the Fish-Men, who fight like lions as Aladdin engages in a fight to the death with Oven. But he is no match for him and falls into the water. He is rescued by Jinbei, who explains that he has come to help them so that everyone stays alive and he can say a proper farewell. What\u0027s more, he wants to use the power of the Fishmen to save his new captain and his friends. Aladdin accepts his help, and the entire crew of the Sun Pirates get together to modify the sea currents to create a huge whirlpool between the Sunny and the massive armada chasing it, preventing Big Mom\u0027s ship from moving forward. Nami orders Brook to maneuver as quickly as possible and discovers that the current the Fish-Men have generated is carrying their ship out to sea. Meanwhile, Big Mom\u0027s routed fleet transmits messages to the rear, informing them that the armada is completely blocked and that the Straw Hat ship is now out of sight. This news reaches Morgans and Stussy, who have fled Whole Cake Island in their flying ship pulled by Martins Factors. Morgans is overjoyed, and explains to his friend that he is very fond of the Straw Hat, because it is among the members of the Worst Generation that the new King of the Pirates will one day see...",

For his part, Sanji learns of Pedro\u0027s death and recalls their first meeting on Zou when Pedro begged for his help in healing and saving all the island\u0027s inhabitants. Sanji feels guilty, but Carrot reassures him that Pedro had made his choice and sacrificed himself so that all his friends could escape Big Mom\u0027s grip. But the young Mink breaks down in tears, simply asking her friend to say thank you to Pedro for all he had done for them. Sanji in turn comforts Carrot while Chopper tends Luffy\u0027s wounds.

She has, however, retained her memories, which she had managed to take from him using the power of her Demon Fruit. At the same time, battle rages all around the island. Germa 66, allied with the Pisces Men commanded by Jinbei, inflicts a crushing defeat on the Empress\u0027s immense fleet. For her part, Pudding continues to cry despite the reassuring presence of Rabian and Nitro, who try to comfort their mistress. Everyone on the island is looking for the fugitives, but no one knows exactly where the Straw Hats are. This news pleases the young woman, who remembers the good times she had spent with Sanji. She had come to love him despite her mother\u0027s orders, for Sanji was the only man who could appreciate her true nature. The fact that she had three eyes was no obstacle to her feelings. He had come to love her too, despite her deformity and, unlike the others, he didn\u0027t consider her a monster. He had been so kind to her and so thoughtful that she was sad to have to leave him. And yet, she had to. The young woman asked Sanji for only one thing: one last kiss. They exchanged it as they held each other. Then Pudding bade her farewell, stealing this last memory with his power. Sanji saw his former fianc\u00e9e leave before him without knowing what had happened to her. He left her to find Luffy, leaving Pudding alone with her sadness.\n\nNot far away, on Whole Cake Island, Charlotte Mont d\u0027Or tried to contact Perospero by snail phone to no avail.

This information sends Mont d\u0027Or into a rage, as his mother\u0027s fleet can no longer follow them! Jinbei and the Vinsmoke Family also hear this news and decide to stop fighting together and flee, as their mission was accomplished. Meanwhile, Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e travels to the Mirror World to visit her brother Katakuri. She removes the hat Luffy had put over his monstrous mouth and begins to nurse him back to health. Undaunted by her brother\u0027s awakening face, she tells him that the fact that his back has never touched the ground is a lie. Br\u00fbl\u00e9e admits with a smile that she knows this and doesn\u0027t blame him. The two of them then reminisce about their childhood and how Katakuri used to scare children his own age with his face. One day, he beat them up. They took revenge by disfiguring Br\u00fbl\u00e9e. His brother punished the culprits and decided to cover his mouth after the incident. Katakuri asks her sister where the Straw Hats are now. Br\u00fbl\u00e9e tells her with disappointment that Luffy and his friends have left Big Mom\u0027s territory, but she swears she\u0027ll never forgive what the Straw Hat did to her big brother.\n\nDespite the relentless efforts of Big Mom\u0027s fleet, the Pirates of the Sun and Germa 66 retreat after learning that the Straw Hat Crew had safely left the Totto Land Archipelago. Everyone is delighted by this news, first and foremost Jinbei. But Big Mom\u0027s arrival ruins his dreams of escape. The Empress is fighting the Sun Pirates and the Vinsmoke Family relentlessly, much to the delight of her men.\n\nFor their part, the Straw Hats have left Big Mom\u0027s territory and have no idea what happened to their allies. Luffy, lying on the ground, is suddenly hungry. Sanji hears the gurgling in his belly and takes it upon himself to satiate his friends, who are only too happy to taste his cooking again. Nami watches this scene with an amused eye, while at the same time, on East Blue, Zeff is doing the same with some pirates who have come to his restaurant to eat. Sanji and his mentor go to great lengths, as hunger spares no one and they have sworn to feed all those who wish to be fed...",

        "description": "Shanks stares out over the ocean, holding a diary of Luffy\u0027s latest exploits, and recalls the time when he knew him as a child in the village of Fuchsia on the Isle of Dawn. Luffy dreamed of becoming a pirate and joining Shanks\u0027 crew, but Shanks considered him too young. However, they had to contend with the brigand Higuma, who publicly humiliated Shanks before Luffy\u0027s very eyes. After this incident, the Pirate Captain discovered to his horror that the young boy had inadvertently eaten the Gomu Gomu no Mi and turned into a rubber man! One day, Higuma attacked Luffy, accusing him of mocking Shanks. Shanks arrived and, thanks to his crew, resolved the situation by neutralizing all Higuma\u0027s men. The humiliated Higuma disappeared, projecting a smoke screen, and took Luffy onto a boat. He threw him overboard, but Higuma was devoured by the Bay Monster. Luffy would have suffered the same fate had Shanks not intervened, losing his left arm in the process. Chasing the monster with the power of his Haki, Shanks consoles Luffy, telling him he\u0027s become a man. A few days later, Shanks\u0027 crew left Fuchsia. Luffy took advantage of this moment to tell his friend that he wanted to be a pirate himself and enlist his own men to become the new King of Pirates. Shanks was proud of him and entrusted him with his straw hat, which he would return to him when Luffy had become a very great pirate.\nThe moment of departure arrived for Luffy who, at the age of 17, set off on an adventure after overcoming the terrifying Bay Monster that stood in his way. For her part, Makino, who had had a child, wonders how Luffy is doing, while Hoop Slap, the village mayor, isn\u0027t too happy that the Straw Hat has become a notorious pirate feared by all. He then shows him a newspaper headline in which Luffy has been acting up. Luffy is resting on the deck of the Sunny and starting to get hungry. He gets up and sees a Raid Suit with the number 3 on it fall out of his pocket, and Chopper reminds Luffy that this was the item that allowed members of Germa 66 to transform when they went into battle. They both want to try it out immediately, but Sanji grabs the Raid Suit to get rid of it. He\u0027s angry with Niji for secretly giving him a Raid Suit, seemingly mocking him for his lack of strength. Luffy and Chopper try to convince him to keep it. But Sanji says he doesn\u0027t need science to be powerful. For her part, Nami shows off her Clima-Tact (which now contains Zeus) in response to Sanji\u0027s scientific laxity. Sanji warns his friends not to mention the words \u0022Germa 66\u0022 and \u0022Vinsmoke\u0022 to him again. Suddenly, from the lookout, Carrot announces that the newspaper has arrived. She reveals to her comrades that Sanji\u0027s bounty has been increased to 330,000,000 Symbol Berry.gif and that the words \u0022Dead or Alive\u0022 are once again inscribed. Sanji is delighted to know that his bounty is now higher than Zoro\u0027s, but is disappointed when he sees the word \u0022Vinsmoke\u0022 printed on the poster. For his part, Brook discovers that Luffy is also depressed, but for a completely different reason.\n\nFar from the trivialities of numbers, all the major royal families are preparing for the Reverie that takes place every four years in Mary Geoise\u0027s Holy Land, including that of King Neptune who reigns over the Ryugu Kingdom, where everyone knows about the exploits of Luffy and Jinbei, who had joined his crew. Neptune plans to declare Fish Island under Luffy\u0027s protection. For her part, Princess Shirahoshi asks her father if she can join him in the Reverie. Neptune gladly accepts, while on the surface, the same excitement is palpable when everyone reads about the young pirate who dared to defy Big Mom. Everyone learns that Luffy has taken seven powerful pirate crews under his wing and that he leads 5,000 men, making him a great pirate captain. As well as being Ace\u0027s brother, he\u0027s also Sabo\u0027s, the second-in-command of the Revolutionary Army, which has already caused quite a stir. The Straw Hat also subdued the evil Germa 66 army, the Sun Pirates and the Firetank Pirates with his charisma and leadership skills. Luffy is also the man who destroyed the Whole Cake Ch\u00e2teau using cunning, and who single-handedly defeated two commanders worth 800 million and one billion respectively. All these feats have made him the fifth Emperor, news that Sakazuki, the Chief Admiral, doesn\u0027t appreciate at all, as he broods with rage in the brand-new Marineford premises; while, for his part, Shank is satisfied with everything Luffy has done so far...",

They will try to find a solution at the next R\u00eaverie, a huge meeting organized every four years that brings together the fifty most powerful families on the planet. Far removed from these preoccupations, Sanji is still stunned by his new search notice, under the worried eyes of his friends who don\u0027t understand what\u0027s happening to him. In fact, the cause of his dismay was that it said \u0022Vinsmoke Sanji\u0022 instead of \u0022Sanji\u0022! Meanwhile, Luffy is crying his eyes out because his bounty has dropped to 1,500,000,000 Symbole Berry.gif.\nMeanwhile, the Navy is on the warpath, as several kidnappings of royalty have taken place. Admiral Sakazuki is in charge of operations. Suddenly, one of his men warns him that a ship belonging to the Kingdom of Lulusia has been attacked by pirates and that Princess Komane has been kidnapped. This news sends the Navy chief into a frenzy. Meanwhile, Riku Doldo III, King of Dressrosa, plays chess with his friend Elizabello II, ruler of the Kingdom of Prodence, who wins the game while their ships are anchored next to each other. They are bothered by some dwarves from the Kingdom of Tontatta and by Rebecca, who tells her grandfather that Luffy is in the newspaper. But Riku reminds them not to talk about their bond with Luffy when they\u0027re in Mary Geoise, as their friends are pirates. Rebecca heads off to join her Aunt Viola on the deck of her ship and tells her about the Straw Hat. Aunt Viola tells her niece that it\u0027s not a month since they left Dressrosa.\n\nBeneath the waves, a crew of unknown pirates in a submarine observe the ships through their periscope and decide to kidnap Princess Viola. Meanwhile, their prisoner, Princess Komane, orders them to contact her father and demand a ransom for her release. The pirates don\u0027t listen and fire two torpedoes at the ships. But the projectiles are intercepted by Koby, who detonates them before they hit their target. For his part, Hermep disables the pirate submarine which has surfaced in a bad way. Its occupants are apprehended by Navy soldiers and Princess Komane is freed. For his part, Rebecca\u0027s father Kyros thanks Koby for saving them, and honors his modesty in the face of his accomplishment. Rebecca approaches Koby, who sees the front page of the newspaper with Luffy on the cover. Kyros\u0027s daughter then lends him her newspaper and Koby is proud to read the article about his friend\u0027s recent achievements against Big Mom before crying with joy. Rebecca is intrigued by the attitude of the Navy captain, who recalls his first encounter with the Straw Hat when he was the prisoner and whipping boy of the infamous Alvida, and his strong desire to join the Navy. Suddenly, Hermep brings him back to reality and orders him to return to their ship. Koby complies, thanking Rebecca and informing her that they will be escorted as soon as they reach New Marine Ford. Before he leaves, Rebecca politely asks Koby if he\u0027s a fan of Luffy. He rigorously tries to deny it, but she sees through his attempts to deny his admiration for the young pirate and promises him that his secret will be well kept.\n\nOn the side of the Four Emperors|Quatre Empereurs, the mood is not good. Kaido is furious that Luffy has ruined his Smile business and triumphed over Big Mom. The latter, on Whole Cake Island, is astonished and vows to avenge this affront by tracking down Morgans, the author of the article about Luffy. For his part, Blackbeard scoffs at the Straw Hat because calling himself an emperor is a bit premature. For Shanks, however, the opposite is true. He\u0027s proud of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and hopes to see him again soon.\n\nOn the Thousand Sunny, Luffy continues to weep at the thought of his bounty being lowered. All his friends are there to comfort him, while Brook carefully examines his wanted notice. He realizes that Luffy had made a mistake in counting the zeros. The living skeleton announces that his captain\u0027s bounty now stands at 1.5 billion berry, a sum that surprises all the crew members as they make their way to the Land of Wa...",

Pinkbeard reveals to the islanders that he sails under Blackbeard\u0027s flag, and tells them to take it easy in the name of the Emperor of the Sea, while his crew attacks them with orders to kill all who resist. Moda, a young farm girl from the island, begs Rosebeard to return the jar of milk he stole from her, revealing that, although the town is poor, it has a reserve of heavenly gold intended for the Nobles of the World. Pinkbeard feigns sympathy, but hits Moda and tells his crew to look for the gold before throwing Moda back, who is caught by Belo Betty, who calls Morley to the rescue. Suddenly, a giant okama makes its way to the ground in front of the pirates and wonders why they\u0027re looking at it so strangely. Pinkbeard orders his men to shoot Morley, but the giant plants his trident in the street and moves it as if it were clay, sweeping away the pirates who are swept away by the huge wave.\nThe inhabitants of Lulusia\u0027s kingdom wonder who this giant and woman are who have saved them. The latter asks them what they want to do, although they don\u0027t know who she is or what she does. The Pinkbeard pirates then see Lindbergh appear in the sky and Karasu standing on a nearby rooftop. They then realize that these four individuals are commanders of the Revolutionary Army. Pink Beard is shocked, for they thought they were scattered all over the world!\n\nMeanwhile, on the sea of the New World, the Sunny sails peacefully towards the Land of Wa. Brook fishes quietly and sings, while Sanji gazes out to sea and smokes a cigarette. He sees Luffy being looked after by Chopper, while Nami and Carrot read the newspaper. Their captain asks if there\u0027s any news from the Revolutionary Army and Nami informs him that, after losing their base in Baltigo to the Blackbeard Pirates, the secret organization led by Luffy\u0027s father, Monkey D. Dragon, has moved its headquarters to Kedetrav. But it\u0027s on this island that Dragon, Emporio Ivankov, Inazuma, Hack and Koala are assembled to sit around a table to discuss the latest actions of the Straw Hats on the Totto Land Archipelago as they wait to meet the other leaders of the Revolutionary Army. Ivankov is pleased to hear about Luffy and Sanji, while Dragon notes that the Kingdom of Germa is no longer part of the World Government. Ivankov wonders why Sabo is lying on the ground. Koala replies that his friend was smiling all the time after discovering Luffy\u0027s latest exploits and that his bounty had increased. Sabo then receives a snail phone call from Lindbergh, who informs him that they are having some problems and asks if they can delay their arrival a little. The okamas of the Kingdom of Kamabakka are excited at the prospect of finally meeting the leaders. Meanwhile, Dragon and Sabo begin to finalize their plans to declare war on the Celestial Dragons during the Reverie.\n\nAt the same time, in the kingdom of Lulusia, the inhabitants watch the four commanders of the Revolutionary Army confronting Pinkbeard\u0027s pirates. Belo Betty gives the citizens the chance to rise up against the pirates. When they answer her call and pick up sticks to fight, they see their strength increased by Belo Betty\u0027s Kobu Kobu no Mi as she proudly waves the Revolutionary Army flag in their direction. Witnessing the scene, Pinkbeard mocks the islanders. Belo Betty asks Lindbergh and Karasu to cover their sides. The citizens launch into battle and, just as the pirates prepare to fire at them, Lindbergh counterattacks using his Cool Shooter, freezing their hands on their weapons and preventing them from using them. The locals attack the pirates violently, while Karasu transforms into a flock of crows that fly into the fray, taking the pirates\u0027 swords with them. The pirates are quickly defeated and Rosebeard is tied up while his men flee, leaving him to his fate. Imprisoned, Rosebeard tells the four commanders of the Revolutionary Army that Blackbeard will make them pay for this affront. But Belo Betty informs him that the Emperor doesn\u0027t give a damn about his subordinates, and then tells the inhabitants of the kingdom of Lulusia that they can pocket the bounty promised on Pinkbeard\u0027s head by handing him over to the World Government. Before leaving the island, she gives Moda, who has retrieved her jar of milk, the coordinates of the Revolutionary Army to ask for their help once again, while thanking them for their courage. All the inhabitants weep with joy as they leave for the island of Kedetrav. Belo Betty tells her companions that they are about to go into battle against the Celestial Dragons. And in two days\u0027 time, the Reverie will begin. Sabo and the other Revolutionaries are also ready to overthrow the established order...",

        "description": "In an effort to combat the violence that the New Era of Piracy would engender, the World Government decided to move Marineford to the entrance of the New World, where it stood as an impregnable fortress under the command of Chief Admiral Sakazuki. Two years earlier, the Navy had triumphed over Whitebeard\u0027s Pirates in the War at the Top. However, their former battlefield headquarters had been completely devastated. For this reason, the World Government decided to build New Marineford to show pirates that justice and righteousness will always triumph.\nIn New Marineford, a furious Sakazuki learns that Fujitora is currently in Mary Geoise. He had expressly forbidden him to set foot in a Navy base again until he had captured Luffy and Law. This remark had amused Issho, who, playing on words, let his superior know that the Holy Land is not strictly speaking a Navy base, which made Sakazuki even angrier. He then talks to Borsalino, recalling Ace\u0027s death in Marineford and Whitebeard\u0027s long, inflammatory tirade against the World Government and Sengoku. The latter is also in the Navy\u0027s new HQ, chatting quietly with his pet goat, which is gobbling up Luffy\u0027s latest wanted poster. Sengoku remembers the young pirate he knew two years ago when he tried to free his brother Ace from Impel Down\u0027s underwater prison, using the services of Baggy the Clown, Mr. 3 and Bon Clay to thwart Director Magellan\u0027s omnipotence. But Luffy is poisoned and would have died if Emporio Ivankov hadn\u0027t intervened using his Demon Fruit, the Horu Horu no Mi. Back on his feet, Luffy, accompanied by Ivankov and his right-hand man, Inazuma, heads to the top level of the prison to free his brother. But his cell was empty! It was then that the Straw Hat met Jinbei, who begged him to free him. They learn that Ace has been transferred to Marineford. Luffy and his companions decide to go there to free him. Thanks to the sacrifice of Bon Clay, who had pretended to be Magellan, the Gate of Justice opens to let Luffy\u0027s ship through to Marineford. There, all the Navy\u0027s forces had gathered to witness Ace\u0027s execution. But Whitebeard appeared and decided to save his beloved son. Thus began the climactic war between the pirates and the Navy. It was intense and bitter until Luffy arrived, determined to save his brother at all costs...",

For his part, Sengoku remembers Luffy\u0027s thunderous arrival at the Marineford naval base to rescue his brother Ace. Before Whitebeard\u0027s astonished eyes, the young pirate launched an attack, facing the Navy troops alone. Finally, he manages to reach his brother and free him, with the help of Mr. 3 disguised as a guard. Unfortunately, Ace is killed by Sakazuki before Luffy\u0027s very eyes! And it\u0027s thanks to the intervention of Shanks the Red that the war at the top of Marineford has ended with Sengoku\u0027s agreement. Sakazuki is still raging, knowing that Whitebeard, before he died, had said that One Piece really did exist. After this bloody conflict, the new Navy HQ was moved to the New World, while the old Marineford was rebuilt and renamed Base G-1. The two naval bases are located on opposite sides of the Red Line, defending access to Mary Geoise\u0027s Holy Land. However, there are two official entrances to the Holy Land: Red Port and Paradise Station, located behind Marine Base G-1. Access to Mary Geoise is via bubble gondolas called bondolas.\nSuddenly, the inhabitants of Red Port shout with joy as they see huge ships announcing themselves in port. These were the delegations of the 50 royal families who had come for the R\u00eaverie. They see King Beer VI of the Kingdom of Roshwan with his princesses, Queen Mororon of the Kingdom of Tajine, King Tacos of the Kingdom of Shishano and King Ham Burger of the Kingdom of Ballywood. King Neptune of the Ryugu kingdom, accompanied by Princess Shirahoshi, Princes Fukaboshi, Ryuboshi and Manboshi, is escorted by Vice-Admiral Garp. The people of Red Port are astonished by this arrival, and say that although the Ryugu kingdom has been part of the World Government for 200 years, this is only the second time they\u0027ve taken part in the Reverie. The young mermaid princess doesn\u0027t dare show herself. But, urged on by her brothers, she climbs out of the carriage and admires the surface for the first time.\n\nMeanwhile, Ryokugyu receives a snail phone call from Sakazuki, who is angry to learn that Fujitora is currently at Mary Geoise. Fujitora is eating a bowl of noodles in front of him. Ryokugyu informs him that he must arrest him and send him back to their superior. But Issho doesn\u0027t care about Sakazuki\u0027s injunctions and wants to challenge the system. For his part, Ryokugyu asks his comrade about Doctor Vegapunk. Issho tells him that he had not been able to meet him, but that he had accomplished something incredible, and implies that the Navy would no longer need the Grand Corsairs, which makes Ryokugyu laugh...",

        "description": "All the inhabitants of Red Port welcome the arrival of King Neptune and his family, escorted by Vice-Admiral Garp. All attention is focused on Princess Shirahoshi, who ventures to the surface for the first time and finally catches a glimpse of the blinding brightness of the sun. She is also the focus of photographers\u0027 flashbulbs, who shoot her relentlessly. They work for Morgans, who himself is captivated by the princess-siren\u0027s dazzling beauty. Neptune is annoyed by all the fuss and worries about it to Garp. Luffy\u0027s grandfather reveals that Shirahoshi\u0027s arrival was eagerly awaited, as she rivals the famous Boa Hancock in beauty. Suddenly, Shirahoshi spotted a tree and was moved.\nAs they walked along, Garp was greeted by Sterry, king of the kingdom of Goa, who asked him if he knew who he was dealing with. Garp laughs at him, calling him a \u0022brat\u0022. Sterry doesn\u0027t take kindly to this insult, reminding Garp that he is a citizen of his kingdom and therefore owes it respect. Lindbergh listens in on their conversation. The latter asked Sabo, who was standing beside him, if it was true that Sterry was his adopted brother. His friend doesn\u0027t reply, and goes back into his memories of the time when his parents adopted Sterry. He was an insufferable, capricious child who wanted to rule everything around him. By the time he was an adult, he was dying to join a royal family. That\u0027s why he married Princess Sally Entoilette, to establish a place of prominence in his life. Shortly afterwards, Sabo\u0027s parents died mysteriously, allowing Sterry and Sally Entoilette to become the new rulers of the kingdom of Goa. Yet all Sabo remembers of his past is his encounter with Luffy and Ace in the Grey Terminal junkyard. All three dreamed of becoming pirates and buying a ship to sail the seas. This dream was ruined by the arrival of Outlook III, who wanted to get his son back and set him on the right path. But Sabo, who had disowned his nobility, wanted to become a pirate. One day, Outlook III, with the help of henchmen, managed to capture Ace and Luffy. Sabo begged his father to free them, promising in return to follow all his orders. He returns to the palace and meets Sterry. Sterry triumphantly announces that Grey Terminal will be set on fire to purify the kingdom. This news stuns Sabo, who worries about the fate of his friends. On his way, he meets Monkey D. Dragon before deciding to set sail at last. As he tries to leave the Kingdom of Goa, Sabo runs into the huge ship of the Celestial Dragon, Saint Jalmack, who uses his rifle to pulverize his boat, which sinks instantly. Sabo is saved from death by Dragon, who makes him second-in-command of the Revolutionary Army.\n\nMeanwhile, the Thousand Sunny was sailing towards the Land of Wa. On deck, Carrot listens attentively to Luffy\u0027s story and discovers that his friend thought Sabo had died with his ship, whereas he didn\u0027t know what had really happened. Despite this, the Straw Hat is happy to know that his brother Sabo is still alive. Sabo has set out to infiltrate Mary Geoise in disguise, with the aim of ruining the Reverie. At the same time, Garp suffers Sterry\u0027s wrath, but he doesn\u0027t care. The young king meets Neptune and is blown away by his towering stature, while fearing he\u0027ll fall ill just by consorting with the Pisces-Men accompanying him.\n\nNeptune\u0027s entire family then embark on the Bondola No. 2 to Mary Geoise\u0027s Holy Land. Garp, who has accompanied the royal family, sees them off with the other delegations. During the journey, Shirahoshi is blown away by the view of Red Port and can\u0027t stop admiring the sun and sky. She hopes to live on the surface and allow all her subjects to have the same experience.\n\nNot far away, on the island of Kedetrav, members of the Revolutionary Army, under Koala\u0027s leadership, are fine-tuning their plan to confront the World Government despite the presence of the Ryugu Kingdom at the Reverie. Sabo\u0027s friend reveals to Belo Betty that she has no desire to overthrow the World Government, but rather to get rid of the Celestial Dragons who run it.\n\nIn Red Line, a violent gust of wind shakes the Bondola and Sterry, who is on board, becomes frightened. His fear is heightened by the sight of a giant emerging from the Red Line wall. But Ham Burger, standing next to him, thinks he\u0027s hallucinating. Suddenly, Sterry sees a flock of crows approaching the Bondola and orders a guard to shoot the birds to prevent them from bursting the bubble supporting their means of locomotion. But the guard, who turns out to be Sabo in disguise, tells Sterry not to worry and that everything will be fine...",

        "description": "The Bondola carrying Fukaboshi, Shirahoshi and the rest of Ryugu\u0027s royal family rises to the top of Red Line where the Reverie will be held. Guards, including Sabo in disguise, stand at the top and hand the Neptune Family members reinforced bubbles for easy movement around the grounds. Shirahoshi and co. marvel at the sheer size of the architecture around them as they climb the long and wide staircases to the gates of Mary Geoise\u0027s Holy Land. While Shirahoshi marvels at the city\u0027s gardens and forest, Sterry also falls under its spell and longs to live there. He hastens to tell the guards escorting them. The guards hand them wooden sleeves and advise them to hold on tightly as the ground begins to shift beneath them.\nThis strangeness terrifies Sterry, who immediately begins to panic, thinking it\u0027s an earthquake and imploring someone to protect him. The guards inform them that they are borrowing a Travelator, an innovative device that allows the ground to move easily. Fukaboshi, Shirahoshi and the rest of his family, however, choose to walk as usual, apparently to admire the scenery and contemplate the forest. As Sterry continues on the Travelator, he mocks the Neptune Family for their apparent fear of modern conveniences and speaks of his intention to introduce the Travelators of the kingdom of Goa, mistakenly calling them Neptune and his kind \u0022filthy pooches\u0022. Fukaboshi, however, is troubled by the Travelator, which turns out to be pulled by hordes of slaves chained underground.\n\nAs Ryugu\u0027s royal family arrives at the entrance to Pangea Castle, Saint Charlos watches them from his family\u0027s palace through a spyglass, and his interest turns to Shirahoshi\u0027s size and beauty. The R\u00eaverie guests enter Mary Geoise through a huge portal and arrive in the reception hall, where all the world\u0027s royal families are present, chatting under the watchful eye of their respective escorts. The members of the Neptune Family take their marks and, in spite of herself, Shirahoshi becomes the center of attention. The guests compliment her on her beauty and try to get her to marry one of their sons. Not knowing what to say to them, Shirahoshi tells them they\u0027re \u0022not her type\u0022, offending the royal hosts and also shocking her brothers Fukaboshi and Ryuboshi. While Fukaboshi tries to put things right, Ryuboshi takes his sister aside and tells her that she must learn not to insult the royal hosts or she\u0027ll provoke a diplomatic incident with the other kingdoms if she doesn\u0027t change her attitude. Unfortunately, Shirahoshi was incapable of lying, and that was her only problem.\n\nMeanwhile, Vivi and Karoo met Rebecca and her bodyguard Leo, who was too cute for the pretty Alabasta princess. He is annoyed by this remark for a while, until he is told that he is one of Luffy\u0027s subordinates. For her part, Rebecca, as lady-in-waiting of Dressrosa, marvels at how the Straw Hats have traveled to so many different places since becoming pirates. Vivi responds in the affirmative, recalling what Luffy and his friends had done back home fighting the infamous Crocodile and his terrible criminal organization, the Baroque Works. To do so, the Straw Hats and Vivi went to Alubarna, the kingdom\u0027s capital, to prevent civil war from breaking out. But Crocodile thwarted their plan, and they had to confront him at the risk of their lives. However, duped by Crocodile, the rebellion and Alabasta\u0027s royal army engaged in a fierce battle. For their part, the Straw Hats confronted the members of Baroque Works in Vivi\u0027s name. In the end, the plot orchestrated by Crocodile was foiled by Luffy and his friends, saving the Kingdom of Alabasta. However, the Straw Hats got no credit, as the World Government decided to give all the credit to the Navy. Nevertheless, Vivi retained her friendship with Luffy and his friends, and hoped to meet up with them again one day. For now, she was happy to know that they had also been to Dressrosa and saved the country. On hearing this, Rebecca and Leo were moved to tears until they were bothered by Shirahoshi, who had heard that Luffy\u0027s name had been mentioned. But Ryuboshi brought his sister back to order, as no one at the Reverie should know about their links with these pirates. Imperceptibly, the three princesses feel closer to each other thanks to their ties to Luffy...",

Their conversation is overheard by Igaram, Viola and Fukaboshi, who have noticed that the three young princesses have become friends because of their mutual friendship with Luffy. Suddenly, Sai, the 13 th leader of the Happou Fleet, appears after hearing Luffy\u0027s name. He comes to say a friendly hello to Rebecca and Leo. Their meeting is interrupted by Wapol, ruler of the evil kingdom of Drum, and his queen Kinderella. As Wapol taunts Vivi and King Cobra, Dalton, king of the Sakura kingdom, and Dr. Kureha appear in turn, ordering him to stop his hateful insults immediately, before going on to greet Vivi, who is delighted to see them both again. Shirahoshi asks his new friend who these people were, and Vivi tells him about her encounter with Dalton and Dr. Kureha when Nami suddenly fell ill. She was immediately taken to the nearest island, where she was properly cared for despite initial refusals. After recalling these memories, Wapol tries to intimidate Dalton by calling him a subordinate, but Dalton turns into a buffalo and tells him they\u0027re on the same footing before talking about Luffy with Vivi and Rebecca, ignoring Wapol\u0027s new insults. He is also grateful to the Straw Hat for saving his country. For her part, Dr. Kureha asks Rebecca and Shirahoshi if they\u0027ve come across a little reindeer with a little nose. The Mermaid Princess tells the doctor that she knows Chopper very well, having met him when he and his friends first arrived on Fish Island. Dr. Kureha is proud to learn this, and remembers Chopper\u0027s great desire to become a doctor worthy of the name and a member of the Straw Hat Crew.\nWhile everyone is reminiscing, Luffy is on the Thousand Sunny, enjoying a well-deserved rest. Suddenly, a cry rings out and Chopper rushes in with his medical kit to treat Carrot, who had hurt her hand while trying to help Sanji cook. At La R\u00eaverie, Sai tells Leo that he intends to cut ties with his country, along with the six other pirates - Cavendish, Ideo, Suleyman, Bartolomeo, Hajrudin and Orlumbus - who have become Luffy\u0027s subordinates, in order to pay off their debts.\n\nMeanwhile, on Impel Down level 6, Doflamingo languishes alone in a cell guarded by Magellan, wondering aloud when the World Government will send assassins to kill him so he won\u0027t tell anyone about the national treasure hidden in Mary Geoise. Doflamingo then says that it doesn\u0027t matter, because power doesn\u0027t last long and will rot faster than people realize. Back in Mary Geoise, a strange man carrying Luffy\u0027s new wanted notice opens the door of a refrigerated safe. Upon entering, he discovers an unusual object which turns out to be a huge straw hat similar to the one Luffy usually wears...",

At the same time, Stelly is summoned to Pangea Castle in Mary Geoise, where he is brought before the Vacant Throne. The accompanying guide asks him to swear an oath before the throne. Stelly says he wants to sit in it, but his attendant informs him that he can\u0027t because all the kingdoms of the world are equal without any lust for supreme power. He points out to Stelly that the twenty weapons protecting the throne represent the oath sworn 800 years ago by the first Twenty creators of the World Government, and that the Vacant Throne is located at the center of the world. The fact that it is vacant is true proof of peace, and that no king should rule this world alone. But Stelly doesn\u0027t care about all these prescriptions, because what he wants now is to sit on that throne and claim to be king of the world.\nAt the same time, in the lobby of Ch\u00e2teau Pangea, Shirahoshi is handcuffed in public by a masked giant who holds her at his mercy under the amused eye of Saint Charlos, who is finally happy to possess a real mermaid. He even intends to make her his favorite pet. Shirahoshi\u0027s brothers try to intervene, but are prevented by their father, who can do nothing against the theft of a Celestial Dragon. For their part, Vivi and Rebecca shout at the top of their voices to stop it, but they too are subject to the laws of the Tenryubitos. However, Leo and Sai try to stop Saint Charlos, but Rob Lucci and the CP-0 stop them, telling them that, by their actions, they had saved their countries. Among the members of CP-0 are Rob Lucci and Kaku, who had already clashed with the Straw Hat Crew when the latter went to Enies Lobby to free Nico Robin from Spandam\u0027s horrible hands. Lucci, having been defeated by Luffy, left CP9 to disappear for a while and join CP-0, the Cipher Pol\u0027s elite unit.\n\nSai struggles to recover from the attack, but is supported by Rebecca. In front of them stands Rob Lucci, who asserts that whatever a god wants, he\u0027ll get, whether he\u0027s reasoned or not. Courageously, Vivi steps in and orders Rob Lucci to free Shirahoshi immediately, as she is his friend. For his part, an enraged Neptune prepares to attack CP-0 and Saint Charlos, while begging forgiveness from his wife, who dreamed of peaceful coexistence between humans and Pisces-Men. Rebecca screams at him to stop, as the Celestial Dragons do not represent the whole of humanity. Just as Neptune was about to commit the irreparable, a figure appears and strikes Saint Charlos in the face with a club, before apologizing to Neptune and ordering Shirahoshi\u0027s release. The ruler of the Isle of Fishmen recognized in this providential man Saint Miosgard whom Queen Otohime had let live. He intervened because he wished to pay his debt to Neptune and the Ryugu Kingdom, to thank Otohime for showing him the error of his ways and restoring his humanity. Moreover, he would do anything to support Neptune and his people, whose arrival he had eagerly awaited...",

But the caller refuses. Kaido still can\u0027t come to terms with the affront the Straw Hat Crew caused by destroying the SMILE factory on Dressrosa. For her part, Big Mom forces Kaido to obey her and reminds him that he owes her a debt of gratitude, while she softens the situation by asking him to remain good friends as in the good old days. As they talked, they had no idea that their conversation was being monitored by the Navy.\nIndeed, in New Marineford, Yarisugi witnesses the two Yonko\u0027s conversation and notices that it\u0027s not even encrypted. His colleagues interpret this communication between pirates as a provocation to the Navy. For his part, Kizaru goes to Sakazuki\u0027s office to offer his services by arresting the two emperors himself. But Sakazuki stops his subordinate\u0027s momentum by letting him know that the strength of the samurai armies of the Land of Was is unknown to them. In Red Port, Gion informs Garp that his grandson Luffy has become the target of two emperors. Garp doesn\u0027t believe a word of it. For his part, Gion informs him that Sakazuki has ordered him not to intervene, as the Land of Wa is outside their jurisdiction, but Hina remains concerned. She recalls that it was thanks to Big Mom and Kaido that Garp became the Navy\u0027s hero. She also reveals the presence of the \u0022Rocks\u0022, whom Garp also knows because they became famous and influential 40 years ago, before Gol D. Roger made his name. If the Rocks were to return, it would be a problem for the Navy. Garp smiles and says that the current situation will be more serious than anyone can imagine.

        "description": "Sabo, disguised as a guard, continues his plan to infiltrate Mary Geoise Land as if nothing had happened, and manages to slip through the castle\u0027s long corridors after discarding his disguise. Careful not to be seen, Sabo takes photos of every room he ventures into, to pass on to his friends in the Revolutionary Army. Entering a room, he is surprised by a guard who threatens him with his spear. Sabo easily neutralizes him before continuing his mission.\nAt the same time, calm has returned to the common courtyard of Ch\u00e2teau Pangea. While Dr. Kureha comforts Vivi, Manshelly uses his talents to magically heal the bruises Shirahoshi had received. For his part, Neptune thanks Mjosgard for his actions, and the latter promises to protect Shirahoshi for the duration of the Reverie. For his part, Leo asks him if they can strike another Celestial Dragon should he dare to threaten the Mermaid Princess. This question surprises Mjosgard, who agrees to take responsibility should this happen. Suddenly, Pell rushes in and apologizes to Vivi for not having been at her side during the incident. Vivi forgives him and asks where her father is now. Pell replies that he is with Fujitora and Riku Doldo III, having received a letter from the Admiral of the Navy. A swarm of crows suddenly flies overhead as Sabo continues his infiltration mission. He learns from two passing guards that security inside the ch\u00e2teau has been tightened since the incident in the courtyard of honor. But Sabo is spotted by the two guards and manages to neutralize them with ease, using everything he has learned in the Revolutionary Army. He is now ready to enter the \u0022Kingdom of the Gods\u0022. Making his way through a wall to exit the castle, he jumps into the void, only to be caught in extremis by a giant raven passing by - none other than one of his accomplices.\n\nMeanwhile, Conney, Queen Mother of the Kingdom of Solbay, makes her way to the Celestial Dragons\u0027 gate leading to the domain of the World Nobles. There, she is stopped by the guards guarding the gate, who ask her to return from whence she came. At the same time, Saint Charlos, his face swollen, is taken inside to treat his wounds. He enters the main courtyard before Sabo, who sees Saint Rosward coming to meet his son on the back of a fully subdued Bartholomew Kuma. Conney takes the opportunity to sneak into the forbidden domain unnoticed. Saint Charlos, wounded, swears to his father that he will take revenge on Mjosgard. For his part, Rosward is surprised that Mjosgard doesn\u0027t own any slaves. It reminds him too much of Homing, who ventured into the underworld nearly 30 years ago to lead a simpler life. He concludes that the Don Quixote family is mad. Charlos suddenly notices the strange horse his father is riding and recognizes Kuma! Rosward, very proud, tells his son that it\u0027s now his turn to hire the services of the \u0022Invincible Slave\u0022. The latter was a former Shichibukai and the former ruler of the Kingdom of Solbay. In the past, he had been commissioned by the World Government to eliminate the Straw Hats when they were in Thriller Bark. But he refused to do so because he had noticed that Luffy, the son of Monkey D. Dragon, was surrounded by the best men around. Later, in the Sabaody Archipelago, Kuma found the Straw Hats and, using his power, sent each of them to the ends of the earth to save them from the Navy. Some time later, after the battle at the top of Marineford, where Kuma had become a soulless cyborg, and before the Straw Hats went to the Isle of the Fishmen, Franky confessed to his companions that Bartholomew Kuma had not forgotten his past, and that he had protected the Thousand Sunny to the limit of his strength.\n\nWitnessing the scene, Sabo choked with rage at the fate the Celestial Dragons had inflicted on his friend. Bartholomew Kuma had become their devoted slave, blindly obeying their orders despite the daily abuse he received. Sabo could see no more and rushed to save his former companion. But he is prevented from doing so by Karasu and Morley, who take him underground to their hideaway, hidden from the eyes of the World Nobles. For his part, Saint Charlos continues to suffer martyrdom, writhing in pain from the wounds inflicted on him by Mjosgard. Hidden in the corner of a wall, Conney changes shape and becomes Jewelry Bonney again. She\u0027s also upset to see Kuma in such a state. She swears she\u0027ll never forgive what the Celestial Dragons have done to her, and vows revenge at any cost as she weeps tears of spite. For his part, Sabo can\u0027t hide his rage from his friends. Karasu tries to calm him down, pointing out that even if they managed to free him, Kuma wouldn\u0027t be the same. On the other hand, Morley explains that Kuma has become a living example of World Government oppression, while Lindbergh reveals that Kuma, being a former ruler of an affiliated kingdom, has been subjugated in order to make an example of him. Armed with these arguments, Sabo calms his anger and swears, along with his comrades, to carry out their mission...",

Luffy\u0027s brother remembers the Straw Hats and what had happened to them when they were on the Sabaody archipelago: Bartholomew Kuma had had them scattered to the four corners of the world to save their lives, so that they could train hard to be ready when they found themselves in the New World. After immersing himself in his memories, Sabo and his friends decide to go to Kuma\u0027s aid.\nMeanwhile, on the Thousand Sunny, Luffy can\u0027t help laughing while looking at his wanted notice. Carrot approaches him and realizes that he\u0027s fascinated by his new bounty, which has risen from 500,000,000 to 1,500,000,000 Symbole Berry.gif! Suddenly, a Postman Martin appears with the news of the day. Sanji grabs the paper and informs his comrades that the Reverie is about to begin. At Ch\u00e2teau Pangea, 50 kings and queens have gathered in the conference room to begin the Reverie. They enter the room and discuss Luffy\u0027s actions towards Big Mom and Kaido. Ham Burger, who has been named president of this year\u0027s Reverie, calls everyone to order as he prepares to discuss world affairs.\n\nAt the same time, in a corridor of the castle, the Five Elders have learned that King Cobra of Alabasta wishes to discuss a matter of the utmost importance with them. Nevertheless, they know that the Nefertari Family was the only one of the 20 founding members to decide to remain on the surface 800 years ago. Moreover, with so many important things having happened in the last two years, the Five Elders declare that the balance cannot be maintained forever and that a great purge may be necessary. In the flowery chamber inside Pangea Castle, a maid lets Im know that the Five Elders have arrived. Im greets them after throwing the shredded photos of Luffy and Blackbeard on the floor, as well as one of Shirahoshi with a sword plunged into it. Carrying a photo of Vivi, Im walks over to the Vacant Throne and sits down. The Five Elders kneel before Im, asking him for the identity of the light of history that was to be extinguished this time...",

        "description": "On their way to the Land of the Wa, Nekomamushi and his crew stopped off at the island where Whitebeard had grown up, and which was considered his homeland. They decided to stay on to find Marco. The latter had taken on the role of island doctor, helping the inhabitants by treating them despite his heavy pirate past. Nekomamushi sees him and invites him to sit down beside him. Marco accepts his invitation and takes the opportunity to tell him that Whitebeard, as an orphan, had grown up on this island, which was too poor to be allied with the World Government. When he started out as a pirate, Whitebeard always cared for the island, sending money and supplies to its inhabitants without revealing his identity, as the island was quite simply his home. However, after the war at the top of Marineford, Marco and his friends tried to defend what Whitebeard was protecting by waging a war of retaliation against Blackbeard when he tried to invade Newgate\u0027s territories. But they were no match for Teach since he had seized power from Whitebeard. He\u0027d taken everything.\nMarco burst into tears thinking about his captain and how he didn\u0027t pay for his tours, sending all his money to this island so that its inhabitants could live honorably. Nekomamushi did his best to comfort him, telling him that this island and all it contained were his inheritance. Marco replied that this was true, and thanked Shanks for burying Whitebeard with honor. He then broached the subject of Edward Weeble, who was looking for people who had known Whitebeard. Marco doesn\u0027t know whether the claims he makes are justified, such as Weeble being Whitebeard\u0027s biological son. That\u0027s what Weeble\u0027s mother Bakkin believes, a pirate who knew Newgate in the past and loved her enough to give her a son. Yet Marco is convinced that she and Weeble are after Whitebeard\u0027s riches, even though they don\u0027t exist.\n\nBecoming more serious, Marco asks Nekomamushi to deliver a message to Luffy if he returns to see him. The Mink promised he would. Marco is aware of his friend\u0027s trip to the Land of Wa and asks him why. Nekomamushi, who hides nothing from him, reveals that he and his men are going there to defeat Kaido. Marco shudders when he hears the name, and thinks that the Straw Hat has gone mad to face such a monster...",

Roger. Before Ace left, Yamato designed a life card for him so they could meet again one day, but Yamato\u0027s part disappeared when his friend died. Yamato reveals to Momonosuk\u00e9 that Oden had written in his logbook that if he didn\u0027t survive, then powerful pirates leading a new generation would come to the New World and eliminate Kaido in just over 20 years. As Yamato recounts this, Luffy, Zoro, Law, Kidd and Killer arrive on the roof to confront Kaido and Big Mom. Luffy, while ignoring the two Emperors, goes to talk to Kinemon, who has been defeated with the other red scabbards, and the samurai asks Luffy if he can entrust him with the destion of the Wa country. As Kaido prepares to attack him, Luffy asks Law to lower the red scabbards while he dodges the Emperor\u0027s attack. As he recalls several events that brought him to this point, he hits Kaido in the face with a Gum Gum Red Rohk, a powerful punch using Gear Third and advanced offensive fluid, which sends him crashing to the ground. Luffy then tells Kaido and Big Mom that he will surpass them and become king of the pirates.",

Meanwhile, at the treasure pavilion, Oden claims he was sent into the future by Toki\u0027s powers, and most of the nine red scabbards believe it\u0027s really him. However, Ashura Doji and Raizo soon realize that it\u0027s a fake, and when \u0022Oden\u0022 doesn\u0027t bleed after Ashura cuts off his face, the scabbards realize that it\u0027s one of Kanjuro\u0027s drawings and that their former comrade has survived, and the latter announces that he intends to kill Momonosuk\u00e9 before he dies of his wounds. Up on the roof, the five members of the \u0022terrible generation\u0022 desperately try to find a way to get the better of Kaido and Big Mom.",

At the same time, Bao Huang announces Kaido\u0027s victory to everyone in the castle, as the latter begins to descend inside. In the attic on the 1st floor of the castle, Kin\u00e9mon and Kikunojo reunite with Momonosuk\u00e9 and Shinobu, but Kanjuro arrives in another Oden drawing. Kiku attacks him, but hesitates at the last moment to strike a blow, allowing Kanjuro to stab him. Enraged, Kin\u00e9mon slices Kanjuro, and as he faints, the spy declares that this is a fitting end for him, having been sliced by his closest companion. Only then does Kaido arrive in the attic and violently attack Kin\u00e9mon, while Shinobu desperately flees with Momonosuk\u00e9. Meanwhile, Onigashima arrives over the main territory of the Wa country.",

On the 3rd floor of the castle, Raizo battles with Fukurokuju, as the latter mocks the red scabbard\u0027s emotional state and his willingness to follow a dead man. On the same floor, Killer has destroyed almost all of Hawkins\u0027 straw dolls, but Hawkins reveals after suffering another attack that his current doll is linked to Kidd, implying that Kidd was injured while fighting Big Mom. In the concert space, King and Queen rage mercilessly against the members of the Hundred Beasts crew who have defected, while Sanji has been overwhelmed by their attacks and Marco has run out of energy. Sanji waits for Lebouc\u0027s treatment of Zoro to take effect as he starts attacking Queen again, while Slurp attempts to shoot the cook with a candy arrow before being attacked by Chavip\u00e8re, who seeks revenge for Pedro. Chopper, Lebouc, Tristane and some samurai try to carry Zoro to safety, but are confronted by King.",

After ten days, the three samurai decided to free themselves from the cave and go to confront Kaido in order to allow Yamato to survive, although this would be suicidal for them. In the present, Yamato expresses his confidence in his identity and purpose, and asks Kaido why he took away his freedom and that of the Wa country, as they engage in a powerful confrontation imbued with royal fluid.",

In the rock room, Apoo proposes to Drake an alliance with himself, Inbi, Fuga and Zanki to finish off the victors at the end of the battle. Meanwhile, Usopp and Nami\u0027s group encounter Kinemon\u0027s severed legs running and talking with farts, the samurai having survived Kaido\u0027s attack because Law hadn\u0027t fully reset his body on Punk Hazard. He guides Usopp and Hamlet to the 1st-floor attic of the castle so that they can give Kikunojo first aid. However, in the attic, the upper half of Kinemon overhears a conversation between Kanjuro and Orochi via snail phone. On Orochi\u0027s orders, and just as he is about to die for good, Kanjuro draws a flaming monk to set fire to the castle and detonate the large quantities of explosives in Onigashima\u0027s arsenal.",

While Sukiyaki reveals that he is alive to Momonosuk\u00e9, Hiyori and the Red Scabbards, Luffy and his crew discuss the ancient weapon Pluto in Wa land, unaware that Caribou is spying on them, excited at the prospect of revealing all about Pluto and Poseidon to a certain someone. A few days later, the crew of Chapeau de paille bid farewell to everyone except Momonosuk\u00e9 and Kin\u00e9mon, and at the port of Tokage, Luffy, Law and Kidd each choose a different destination. Kidd then shows a poster that shows Crocodile and Mihawk working under Emperor Baggy in a new company called \u0022Cross Guild\u0022, which has reportedly started putting bounties on the heads of some Navy soldiers. Law gives Kidd a copy of Kaido\u0027s Road Poneglyph, while Kidd and Killer discuss a \u0022man with a fire scar\u0022 who is said to have crucial information in the race for \u0022One Piece\u0022.

After the five deans reply that they have no knowledge of what became of Lillie, Cobra asks them what the \u201cD\u201d actually stands for, while Imu listens in on the conversation with a snail phone.

As the five deans draw their weapons and prepare to kill Cobra, the latter reveals Queen Lillie\u0027s full name: \u201cNefertari D. Lillie\u201d. As Imu critically wounds Cobra with a mysterious arrow, Sabo attacks the five deans before turning on Imu, but the latter blocks his flames by transforming into a gigantic creature.

Imu attacks again, wounding Cobra and Sabo, and as Cobra resolves to die, he continues his message by quoting the short letter left by Lillie as a legacy for his descendants.

As the Reverie draws to a close, Vivi has been captured by CP0 and while she\u0027s chatting with Kalifa and Jabura, Wapol bursts through the wall to make a quick getaway from Marie-Joie, allowing Vivi to escape by jumping into Wapol\u0027s mouth.",
