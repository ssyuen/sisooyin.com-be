        "description": "Luffy has grown up to become the master of Rusukaina Island after two years of intensive training. He bids farewell to the animals with whom he has become friends, then sets off again for the Sabaody Archipelago, where Rayleigh and the members of the Straw Hat Crew are waiting for him. Zoro gets there first and heads for the bar run by Shakky. He has changed a little over time, having lost an eye, and now sports a long scar on the left side of his face, giving him a darker side. A few days later, Nami appears, more beautiful than ever: she\u0027s let her hair grow. She\u0027s drinking alone in a bar, but is noticed by a crew posing as the real Straw Hats. Usopp, who has beefed up his muscles, arrives shortly afterwards and uses one of his Pop Greens to neutralize the fake crew. At the same time, Sanji approaches the archipelago after being transported by Ivankov\u0027s okamas. His appearance has also changed: he has grown a fine moustache and a small goatee, and his wick now covers his right eye instead of his left. Robin is one of the last to arrive at Sabaody. Her bangs are gone and she\u0027s become even more beautiful. As for Brook, he\u0027s become a world-famous singer known as \u0022Soul King Brook\u0022. Chopper has a new hat and is as fond of cotton candy as ever. As for Franky, he\u0027s upgraded his cyborg body. No sooner has he arrived in Sabaody than he\u0027s off to examine the Thousand Sunny. Luffy, the last crew member to arrive, unwittingly attracts the attention of the False Straw Hats.",

        "description": "While Sanji moves at incredible speed, using his famous Devil\u0027s Leg technique to strike a Kraken tentacle, Zoro uses a new technique to cut another tentacle. As for Luffy, he uses his new technique by doing a Gear Third with his right arm reinforced with Combative Fluid to make it even more powerful. After hitting the Kraken head-on, Luffy frees a shark, strangely dressed in a T-shirt, which was stuck in one of the Kraken\u0027s proboscis. The animal approaches his rescuers, and after thanking them for saving him, swims away. Still stunned by this disturbing discovery, the Straw Hat Crew and the sea monster fall into a waterfall. Luffy, Zoro and Sanji, still equipped with their autonomous combat bubbles, are separated from the rest of the crew and carried away. Their companions, aboard the Sunny, encounter various obstacles on their way, forcing Franky to use Burst Blows several times, which have the effect of considerably reducing the ship\u0027s special coating and their living space. After these misadventures, they pass over a volcanic zone and are on the verge of being swallowed up by a gigantic abyssal anglerfish. They owe their salvation to its master, a huge, human-looking sea monk, who sternly scolds his pet for daring to swallow a ship. But soon their savior freezes when a mysterious pirate ship suddenly appears.",

The captain of the New Crew of Fishmen confessed that he had joined the royal army with the sole aim of learning all military techniques. His only ambition was to revive Arlong\u0027s dream. Nami was shocked by this confession and, with Camie\u0027s help, fled the palace to seek help at the Marine Forest, where Jinbe had arranged for Luffy to meet him. The battle begins and, as he confronts the Straw Hats, Hody destroys a wall of the palace, creating a breach that completely floods the courtroom. Zoro asks his companions and the king, who has been released from his chains, to flee while he remains alone to prevent Hody from pursuing them. The fight between Hody and Zoro is fierce. But the Fish Man is in his element and forces the swordsman to fight him underwater. On his way to the Marine Forest, Megalo unwittingly spits out Princess Shirahoshi, who appears before the inhabitants of Fishman Island. Thinking that the members of the Straw Hat Crew were responsible for kidnapping the princess, they try to stop Luffy, Sanji and Chopper. The latter were busy treating Octo, who is immediately accused of complicity.",

Their reputation outstripped their own, and even reached the ears of Vice-Admiral Borsalino, who could not deny that these new forbears of a different kind would upset the balance of the world if they were not stopped. Three years after Tiger attacked Terre Sainte de Marie-Joie, the Sun Pirates met Koala, an 11-year-old girl. She was a former human slave whom Tiger had freed. The captain agreed to take her aboard his ship. Still traumatized by her past, the little girl behaved like a slave, always smiling and never complaining so as not to be killed by the Fish-Men. This attitude exasperated Tiger so much that he decided to cover the slave mark Koala had on her back with the symbol of the Sun Pirates, to show her that the Pisces-Men were very different from the Celestial Dragons, the little girl\u0027s former torturers. He even promised to take her back to her native island. Moved to the very depths of her being, Koala was at last able to express the emotions she had had to repress for so many years, and began to weep loudly as she thanked her saviors.",

During the trip, Jinbe played with the child, realizing that his hatred of humans was probably due to his fear of the unknown. As he grew closer to Koala, the Fish-Man realized that Queen Otohime\u0027s arguments were justified, and that a rapprochement between Fish-Men and humans could be possible. Using an Eternal Pose to locate the girl\u0027s native island, Fisher Tiger decided to take her back to her village himself. But the suspicious villagers had warned the Navy forces, commanded by Rear Admiral Strawberry, of the Fishmen\u0027s imminent arrival on their island. They were ambushed. Their ship was badly damaged, but many managed to escape after rescuing their captain from the Navy\u0027s clutches. Tiger, however, was seriously wounded during the skirmish, and succumbed to his injuries on board a Navy ship his men had managed to commandeer. Refusing to be transfused with human blood, which was compatible with his own, he forced his crew to promise him, before his death, that they would no longer hate humans, and that they would not pass on this hatred to future generations of Fishmen, even after confessing his painful past as a slave.",

Once there, he attacked the crews of the Navy ships stationed on the island, but was defeated by Vice-Admiral Borsalino, future Admiral Kizaru, who had been waiting for his arrival. He overpowered him with a beam of light, slightly injuring him. Following this forceful arrest, Arlong was interrogated at length and then imprisoned at Impel Down. Jinbe, who now had a free hand, became \u0022The First Son of the Sea\u0022, i.e. captain of the Sun Pirates. Recognized as a major threat to the Navy, he was offered the position of Grand Corsair. Fishman accepts so that he can free Arlong, who has a fierce hatred of humans, and let the Sun Pirates return home in peace. After his release, Arlong is furious at this arrangement and violently attacks Jinbe, who defeats him in single combat. Following this altercation, the Sun Pirates split into three groups who went their separate ways: the first was led by Jinbe, the second by Arlong and the third by Macro, a dissident pirate.",

Meanwhile, Queen Otohime learned that a Celestial Dragon, named Miosgard, had arrived on the Isle of the Fishmen in search of escaped slaves. This human was the only survivor of his crew. His ship had arrived from the surface in a bad way. As the subjects of the Ryugu Kingdom administered first aid to Miosgard, he began to insult them, demanding that they bring him a mask to avoid breathing the same air as them. Full of rage, the Celestial Dragon orders his former slaves to return with him to the surface. This arrogance exasperates former Sun Pirates like Aladdin, who have returned to live in peace on the Isle of the Fishmen, and want to kill this detestable character. But Queen Otohime arrives on the scene and stands between her subjects and the Celestial Dragon, who takes advantage of the situation to take the sovereign hostage by aiming the barrel of his golden pistol at the temple of Princess Shirahoshi\u0027s mother, who is present with her brothers, if his demands are not met...",

A week later, the Queen returned from her long journey to the surface with some very good news: a letter written by the Celestial Dragons guaranteeing the beginning of a cordial understanding between the Pisces-Men and humans. Just as all seemed to be going well, the sovereign\u0027s petitions mysteriously caught fire in the three urns in which they were stored, and someone fired a shot at Otohime. Otohime, shot through the heart, succumbed and, before dying, forced her three sons, Princes Fukaboshi, Ryuboshi and Manboshi, to promise to protect their little sister, Shirahoshi, who had the gift of communicating with the Sea Kings, immense sea creatures. But what the sovereign didn\u0027t know was that the Mermaid Princess, who was only 6 at the time, was about to be stalked by the pirate Vander Decken, who had fallen madly in love with her and dreamed of marrying her despite her young age.",

They are ruthlessly led to Tuna Rope Square, where they see King Neptune and Princes Fukaboshi, Ryuboshi and Manboshi, chained and awaiting execution. When Madame Shirley reveals to Hody Jones that it is Luffy who will destroy the Isle of the Fishmen, the captain of the forbans, vexed to know that it was not he who had the fate of the Ryugu Kingdom in his hands, eliminates the prophetess by firing an explosive bullet that sends her into chaos. Then, in the meantime, Hody Jones confesses to all his men gathered in the square - at least 100,000 outlaws, all from the Fishman District - that he is the one responsible for the assassination of Queen Otohime. This revelation fills all the inhabitants of Fishman Island with horror, including Shirahoshi, who already knew the true identity of his mother\u0027s murderer. Meanwhile, Decken, his heart filled with bitterness and hatred for the Mermaid Princess, decides to kill her by hurling the Noah Ark at Fish Island after touching it with his hand.",

Yet, even knowing this, the young princess preferred to keep silent to respect the promise her late mother had made to her four children. After hearing Shirahoshi\u0027s story, the leader of the New Crew of Fishmen laughed at her and ordered that King Neptune and Princes Fukaboshi, Ryuboshi and Manboshi be executed on the spot. At the same time, Madame Shirley, despite her injury, informs a group of children that her forecasts do not give the exact date for the destruction of the Isle of the Fish-Men, and soon its inhabitants start calling on Luffy to take action, since their fate is now sealed. For her part, Princess Shirahoshi pleads with all her might for the Straw Hat to show up and save the life of her father, who is about to be beheaded by Hody himself. Luffy doesn\u0027t hesitate. Hiding in Megalo\u0027s belly, he suddenly emerges from the shark\u0027s stomach and delivers a tremendous kick that sends Hody crashing to the mat. At the same moment, Nami appears, warning Robin that she has recovered the Celestial Dragons\u0027 letter to Queen Otohime and the keys to the prisoners\u0027 chains. The young archaeologist, before Shirahoshi\u0027s astonished eyes, frees her and her brothers. The latter looked after their father, and the four of them buried themselves on the back of Hoe, the royal whale in the eyes and beard of their captors. Suddenly, the other members of the Straw Hat Crew arrive aboard the Sunny, suspended in the sky by a huge air bubble. Franky suddenly activates the Gaon cannon, whose deflagration causes chaos in the ranks of their enemies. Once their ship has landed, the battle between the Straw Hats and the new Fishman Pirates is imminent. Robin takes advantage of this moment to set Jinbe free, who is delighted to join Luffy in battle against Hody Jones and his men, before the stunned eyes of the inhabitants of Fishman Island.",

Determined to kill Princess Mermaid, he had forgotten that Vander Decken was not quite dead. Although in bad shape, the captain of the Flying Dutchman was still conscious enough to keep the Noah afloat and continue to pursue Shirahoshi wherever she went. Meanwhile, the battle between the Straw Hats and Hody Jones\u0027s men continues to rage on Tuna Rope Square. Luffy\u0027s friends are fighting hard against super-powered enemies who have overdosed on steroid pills. They soon realize that they hold the fate of the inhabitants of Fishman Island in their hands. At the same time, Princess Shirahoshi\u0027s brothers shout at her to change direction and turn the Noah sideways. But Hody is having none of it and, waiting for Decken to breathe his last, pursues the princess by any means necessary. Princes Fukaboshi, Manboshi and Ryuboshi try to oppose him, but without much success. Just as Decken was about to take revenge on Hody by hurling an axe at him from inside the Noah, his strength failed him and he finally expired. As he died, his power disappeared with him, and soon the Noah began to slow down, then stop, before beginning a vertiginous fall towards the Isle of the Fish-Men!",

Her three brothers try to step in to defend their sister and Luffy, but all three are defeated by the dreaded steroid-doped Fishman. The Straw Hat is then forced to fight Hody, and chooses the Ark as the location for the confrontation. But knowing the young pirate\u0027s weakness, Hody destroys the air bubble enveloping the Noah, forcing Luffy to fight underwater. Just when all was lost, Prince Fukaboshi comes to the Straw Hat\u0027s rescue, saving him from certain death. Then, King Neptune\u0027s eldest son faced the captain of the New Crew of Fishmen in single combat. The battle was fierce, but Fukaboshi, for all his valour, was no match for such an adversary, who treacherously stabbed him to death before his sister\u0027s horrified eyes. Frightened, she obeys her wounded brother\u0027s orders to swim as far as possible with Luffy alongside the ark. For his part, thanks to a snail phone given to him by Prince Fukaboshi when he was with him, the Straw Hat receives a call from those in charge of the Air Tank above Fishman Island. They inform him that they have prepared a huge air bubble with all available reserves capable of completely enveloping the Noah. This procedure won\u0027t stop the ship\u0027s fall, but it can be easily deflected so it won\u0027t hit its target. What\u0027s more, those in charge of the Air Tank only have one shot at this, which they must not waste in vain. For his part, Hody, who hasn\u0027t yet guessed the Straw Hat\u0027s plan, attacks poor Shirahoshi again, but Luffy stands between the princess and the Fishman. After shattering his weapon, the Straw Hat delivers a lightning blow that infuriates Hody. Swallowing another dose of steroids, Hody suddenly transforms, becoming even bigger and more powerful. Just as he was about to attack him again, Luffy receives a call from Fukaboshi on his snail phone. In a weak voice, Shirahoshi\u0027s older brother tells him that he has discovered who Hody really is...",

Together, Jinbe and Sanji continue their battle against Wadatsumi. The latter, unhappy at not being able to defeat such tiny opponents, gets angry and bloats up on steroids, unknowingly crushing his own allies with his hands. The Straw Hat Crew\u0027s cook had the mischievous pleasure of infuriating him further by telling him he was smaller than the Kraken. This morphological comparison exasperated Wadatsumi, who began to charge. Meanwhile, the Minister of the Right arrived on the battlefield with part of the royal army and was informed of the situation. He admits his mistake and immediately joins the Straw Hats and Jinbe with his own men. At the same time, Hammond, one of Hody\u0027s lieutenants, uses the human pirates enslaved by the Fishmen to attack Luffy\u0027s companions. But his plan is foiled by Robin, who uses her powers to free the human slaves. The latter immediately allied themselves with their saviors, making the fight even fiercer. But suddenly an alarm sounds on Fish Island! As the evacuation order is given, Luffy and Shirahoshi learn the truth about Hody Jones. The Man-Fish is driven by an ancestral hatred of humans, even though they have done nothing to him. After making this confession, Hody sneers before charging at Princess Mermaid and Straw Hat with bloodshot eyes, aiming to kill them.",

        "description": "Despite his injury, Prince Fukaboshi begins to recount Hody\u0027s past, and explains who this mysterious Fishman, who hated humans so much, really was. From their earliest childhood, the officers of the New Crew of Fishmen had always been taught that humans belonged to an inferior race, as they were unable to breathe underwater. Based on this argument, Hody and his crew vowed to wipe them all out to ensure the survival of their own species. And the more time passed, the more obsessed they became with the idea. So much so that Hody enlisted with his men in the ranks of the royal army. They committed many crimes, and even celebrated the death of Queen Otohime, who was determined to bring humans and Fishmen closer together. It was at this time that the captain of the New Fishmen Crew began to consume and produce large doses of steroids, which were to guarantee him even greater power in the years to come. After these revelations, Fukaboshi, with tears in his eyes, laments the circumstances that led to the death of his beloved mother. His hatred of humans has done far too much harm to his people, and he wants to make amends. He begs Luffy\u0027s forgiveness before joining him to fight Hody Jones\u0027 murderous insanity. The Straw Hat, happy with this alliance, prepares to fight Hody again after learning that the Air Tank is ready to launch a huge air bubble completely surrounding the Noah before it crashes on Fishman\u0027s Island. Meanwhile, Luffy\u0027s friends continue their respective battles against Hody Jones\u0027 lieutenants alongside Jinbe, who fights like a lion.",

        "description": "Everyone on Fishman\u0027s Island celebrates the Straw Hats\u0027 victory over Hody Jones\u0027 men. Embarrassed by such popularity, Luffy and his friends leave Tuna Rope Square. Indeed, Luffy and Zoro are afraid of being considered heroes, and thus of sharing food and sake with the rest of the inhabitants. A little later aboard the Sunny, Jinbe politely rebuffs Luffy\u0027s proposal, telling him that he still has things to take care of in Ryugu Kingdom. However, he promises to come and meet him when all this is settled, and will join his crew if Luffy is still willing. Suddenly, Princess Shirahoshi and a royal soldier invite the Straw Hats to the palace to celebrate their victory over Hody Jones. The whole island goes out of its way to offer the pirates a banquet worthy of the name. While the party is in full swing, Robin isolates himself with King Neptune to talk to him about something important. Two years ago, on the celestial island of Skypi\u00e9a, the young archaeologist had discovered that a Poneglyph lurked on the Isle of the Fish-Men. It was this inscription that she had previously read while in the Marine Forest. Robin then mentions what she had discovered: there was once a Mermaid Princess who had the gift of being able to control the Sea Kings, powerful sea creatures. It seems that Shirahoshi has inherited this power. Yet the Poneglyph concealed other equally disturbing information: one concerned Noah\u0027s Ark, and another dealt with the life of a mysterious character named Joy Boy, who was said to have a close link with Poseidon, one of the three famous great ancient Weapons...",

Jinbe takes advantage of this moment to tell them about the battle between two Navy Admirals vying for the position vacated by Sengoku. Everyone is surprised to learn that Akainu has become the new Chief Admiral in place of Aokiji. King Neptune talks to his daughter Shirahoshi and Robin about the Poneglyphs found in the Marine Forest and explains all he knows about the Ancient Weapons. But their conversation is overheard by Caribou, who has managed to evade the guards\u0027 vigilance. The bandit discreetly takes advantage of this to head for the young princess\u0027s room, with the aim of kidnapping her using the powers of his Demon Fruit and selling her back to Sabaody for a very good price. But his plan is foiled and Luffy manages to chase him off, much to everyone\u0027s relief. But Caribou had time to steal the treasures from the Ryugu Palace under the very noses of the guards. Meanwhile, in the Palace\u0027s gaols, a strange metamorphosis is taking place in Hody Jones\u0027 men and in himself. Under the effect of the steroids they had taken in excess, they had aged considerably, but still retained their hatred of the royal family and humans. Neptune explained to his guests the dangerous side effects of these energy pills, which were not to be misused. After this unfortunate incident, the party continues in full swing until the arrival of two of Big Mom\u0027s emissaries, Baron Tamago and Pekoms, who demand sweets for their captain. Otherwise, the protector of Fishman Island would destroy the Ryugu Kingdom if she wasn\u0027t given these precious treats immediately!",

At the same time, Jinbe tells King Neptune that the Sun Pirates have allied themselves with Big Mom, whereas he would rather cut ties with her. But there\u0027s another problem. The Tamate Box, stolen by Hody ten years ago, is now in Luffy\u0027s hands. But the Minister of the Right, fearing another theft, had filled it with explosives at the time. He feared that Luffy\u0027s attempt to open it would cause the contents to explode. For his part, Caribou, still on the run, went in search of the treasures Luffy had taken from him and discovered that they were now the property of Pekoms and Tamago, without knowing that it was the Straw Hat himself who had given them to their captain, the terrible Big Mom, so that she wouldn\u0027t destroy the Ryugu Kingdom, to the great displeasure of King Neptune and Nami, who dreamed of acquiring all this fortune. Claiming that these treasures were rightfully his, Caribou challenged Pekoms to a duel. But the forban is quickly defeated by Big Mom\u0027s henchman, who easily crushes him with a well-felt punch to the stomach. After this incident, Luffy and his friends are escorted to the main port of Ryugu Kingdom in the company of King Neptune on his whale Hoe, Princes Fukaboshi, Ryuboshi and Manboshi and Princess Shirahoshi riding her shark Megalo. As they are hailed as heroes, the Straw Hat is overjoyed to see Franky aboard the Sunny, decked out and ready to go again. Meanwhile, on the surface of the oceans near Red Line in the New World, a fierce battle is taking place between the G-5 Navy and pirates whose ships are mysteriously emerging from the depths of the sea. Vice-Admiral Smoker, assisted by his loyal Tashigi, has taken command of the Navy\u0027s ships. He interrogates the pirates he has just captured. They turn out to be former prisoners enslaved by Hody Jones of the Fishman District. Threatened, one of them confesses to Smoker that he and his men have been freed thanks to the Crew of the Straw Hat, a piece of information that doesn\u0027t surprise the phlegmatic naval officer, who immediately gets back on the hunt.",
