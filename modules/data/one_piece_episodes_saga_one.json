They soon meet Usopp, a whimsical young man who spends his mornings shouting about the arrival of supposed pirates, so much so that no one believes him anymore. The four youngsters soon incur the wrath of Klahadoll, the steward of Kaya\u0027s manor, a reclusive landowner. As Usopp is ill, he often comes to tell him stories to cheer him up, something the steward doesn\u0027t appreciate when he hears that Usopp\u0027s father is a pirate in the pay of Shanks.\n\nLater, Luffy and Usopp overhear a conversation between Klahadoll and Jango. The latter is in fact Captain Kuro, a bloodthirsty pirate who aspires to take control of Kaya\u0027s fortune and then kill her. But when Usopp tries to warn the inhabitants, no one listens. So it\u0027s up to Luffy, Zoro, Nami and Usopp to deal with Captain Kuro\u0027s crew, who arrive shortly afterwards.\n\nFollowing an emphatic victory, Usopp agrees to join Luffy, the newest member of his crew, on the Vogue Merry.",

        "description": "In this episode, Sanji\u0027s past is recounted. As a child, he was a cook on a restaurant boat, telling the cooks about his dream of discovering All Blue, a vast expanse of water encompassing all the other seas, when his boat was boarded by Zeff\u0027s red-footed crew. Just as they were about to set sail, a storm intensified and a wave capsized Sanji in the sea. Zeff, in a fit of compassion after hearing from Sanji that he wouldn\u0027t die before discovering All Blue, dived in to try and save the child. With his leg caught in an anvil, Zeff lost it and saved Sanji. Stranded on a large boulder in the middle of the sea, Sanji and Zeff tried to survive on the few victuals the waves brought them, while keeping an eye on the open sea from both sides of the rock, hoping that a boat would arrive.",
