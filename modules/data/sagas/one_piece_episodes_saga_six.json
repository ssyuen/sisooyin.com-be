Level 6, meanwhile, is home to world-shattering criminals such as Crocodile, the former Grand Corsair. To reach his brother, Luffy has to cross Impel Down one by one. He encounters old acquaintances on each floor who will enable him to reach the floor below. Baggy on the 1st floor, Mr.3 on the 2nd floor, Mr.2 on the 3rd floor. Luffy and his group face a host of adversaries, including :\n\ndemon guardians (Minotaur, Minokoala, Minoceros and Minozebra)\nfloor masters (Blugori, Basilik, Manticore, Sphinx and Wolves)\nthe managers (Magellan the warden, Hannyabal the deputy warden, Saldeath head of the blugori, Sadi head of the prison guards).\nUnfortunately, Luffy arrives too late on the 6th floor, due to the confrontation he lost to Magellan and his Poison Fruit. However, this delay allows him to meet the famous Ivankov (queen of the kingdom of Kedetrav) and Inazuma of the revolutionary army on the legendary floor called Paradise in Hell (which is on floor 5.5). Accompanied by the latter and Jinbe (a great privateer locked up for opposing the war against Whitebeard) and Crocodile, who were locked up on the 6th floor, Luffy decides to escape from Impel Down. Once out of prison, he and his group became the second escapees from Impel Down, 20 years after the legendary Shiki the Golden Lion, who was the first to escape.",

Then Ivankov appears, having partially cured himself of the poison administered by Magellan during his last battle. Accompanied by his faithful Inazuma, he joins the other escaped prisoners at the main entrance, having punctured the prison\u0027s stone floor with his head. This brutal appearance by the master of Newcomer Land did not disarm the Director of Impel Down prison, who was determined to arrest the fugitives. With their chances of escape halted by the lack of ships to take them away from the prison island, the Straw Hat and his companions are cornered at sea. Luffy suddenly receives a snail phone call from Jinbe, who orders him to jump into the water. Obeying his friend and using Ivankov as a sort of giant lifebuoy, Luffy and the other Impel Down prisoners slip into the transvestite\u0027s hair and ask him to emit the strongest wind he can to escape this nightmarish place. As if by magic, and before Magellan\u0027s stunned eyes, Ivankov manages to launch himself into the air with the fugitives, and his race towards the sea is miraculously halted by the unexpected arrival of a herd of whale sharks, sent by Jinbe, who save them from drowning in extremis.",

The loss of Bon Clay is still fresh in everyone\u0027s mind, but the hardest part is yet to come, as the new objective, in addition to saving Ace from certain death, is to reach Navy Headquarters.

At the same time, the Navy soldiers who have failed to catch up with the escaped prisoners warn HQ, via snail phone, of their imminent arrival.

            "description": "Accompanied by Boa Hancock, Luffy travels to Impel Down to rescue his brother Ace, who is being held prisoner there. Impel Down is the underwater prison of the World Government. Impel Down is officially a 5-floor prison, unofficially a 6-floor prison: Crimson Hell (Floor 1), Beast Hell (Floor 2), Hunger Hell (Floor 3), Fiery Hell (Floor 4), Ice Hell (Floor 5) and Eternal Hell (Floor 6). Each level features a different class of outlaw, and the higher the level, the more dangerous the criminals. Level 6, meanwhile, is home to world-shattering criminals such as Crocodile, the former Grand Corsair. To reach his brother, Luffy has to cross Impel Down one by one. He encounters old acquaintances on each floor who will enable him to reach the floor below. Baggy on the 1st floor, Mr.3 on the 2nd floor, Mr.2 on the 3rd floor. Luffy and his group face a host of adversaries, including :\n\ndemon guardians (Minotaur, Minokoala, Minoceros and Minozebra)\nfloor masters (Blugori, Basilik, Manticore, Sphinx and Wolves)\nthe managers (Magellan the warden, Hannyabal the deputy warden, Saldeath head of the blugori, Sadi head of the prison guards).\nUnfortunately, Luffy arrives too late on the 6th floor, due to the confrontation he lost to Magellan and his Poison Fruit. However, this delay allows him to meet the famous Ivankov (queen of the kingdom of Kedetrav) and Inazuma of the revolutionary army on the legendary floor called Paradise in Hell (which is on floor 5.5). Accompanied by the latter and Jinbe (a great privateer locked up for opposing the war against Whitebeard) and Crocodile, who were locked up on the 6th floor, Luffy decides to escape from Impel Down. Once out of prison, he and his group became the second escapees from Impel Down, 20 years after the legendary Shiki the Golden Lion, who was the first to escape.",

Just as Luffy and his men are about to free him, Crocodile takes advantage of the situation to try and kill Whitebeard. But he\u0027s stopped in his tracks by the Straw Hat, who knows his Achilles\u0027 heel: water. The former head of Baroque Works is forced to abandon his plan and suddenly sees Luffy standing proudly before Edward Newgate. The latter recognizes him as Ace\u0027s younger brother because of the straw hat that Shanks had entrusted to him from his earliest childhood. Far from being impressed by the power of Whitebeard, who is considered the strongest man in the world, Luffy addresses him as an equal and announces without the slightest embarrassment that he will save Ace and become the next King of the Pirates.",

The pirates accelerate their advance, but Kizaru enters the fray, hurling a deadly beam of light at the Straw Hat, which is quickly deflected by Emporio Ivankov, who saves his life once again. However, the former master of Newcomer Land is attacked by Bartholomew Kuma, who tries to stop him. For their part, Jango and Fullbody, two members of the Marines and old acquaintances of the Straw Hat, try to stop Luffy on the orders of their superior Hina. But their tactics fail: Jango hypnotizes himself, and Fullbody with him. Luffy miraculously escapes Hina\u0027s attack using the Gear Second technique. Meanwhile, Whitebeard\u0027s allies battle with the vice-admirals and Squardo, a pirate captain allied with Whitebeard\u0027s crew, meets someone who seems to know him. Meanwhile, Moria, leading an army of zombies, tries to halt Luffy\u0027s advance. Luffy still intends to save Ace, but the latter begs him to give up. The Straw Hat\u0027s brother\u0027s fate is already sealed, and nothing and no one can change that. But Luffy is stubborn, and will do anything to save his brother, even if it means dying. While Jinbe valiantly battles the zombies of Gecko Moria, purifying them with sea water, Sengoku, the Admiral Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, confesses to everyone that Luffy is the son of Monkey D. Dragon, the leader of the revolutionary army.",

Kizaru takes advantage of the situation to grab him and slam him hard against the ground. Meanwhile, Sengoku orders the executioners to execute Ace, but Crocodile intervenes, claiming that he had come to Marineford to kill Whitebeard, not to let the Marine forces win. The former head of Baroque Works must now fight Doflamingo, who has come to arrest him. For his part, Luffy runs like hell to the scaffold, but is stopped in his tracks by Admiral Aokiji, who blocks his path. The Straw Hat is saved in extremis by Marco, who hits Aokiji with all his might as he tries to finish off the young pirate. While Mr. 3 hides to avoid being frozen by Aikiji\u0027s power, Whitebeard\u0027s pirates rush in through a breach in the encircling wall. The Navy soldiers retaliate with cannon fire. Edward Newgate saves his men\u0027s lives by using a ship he has hidden nearby. Thanks to this subterfuge, Whitebeard\u0027s men enter Marineford and are ready to do battle with the opposing forces. Aware of the situation, Sengoku and Garp, Luffy\u0027s grandfather, are forced to fight against the attackers, who have arrived in large numbers.",

To avenge the death of his two sons, Ace and Satch, Edward Newgate begins a fierce battle against Blackbeard. Even using his powers to nullify those of his terrible adversary, Whitebeard delivers a fatal blow to his assailant with his bisento, and then attempts to slice Blackbeard\u0027s body in two by holding him by the throat. But Marshall D. Teach is the strongest and manages to free himself quickly. He orders his men to attack Whitebeard all at once. The poor pirate, alone against all, receives dozens of saber, rifle and cannon blows through his body without even flinching. After a while, the killing stopped and Newgate remembered his last encounter with Gol D. Roger, the legendary King of Pirates, and his desire to start a family one day. After recalling these tender memories, Whitebeard died on his feet, telling Blackbeard that he was not the right person for Roger. With a final sigh, he also declared that One Piece really did exist, before finally succumbing, still standing and proud that no bullet had pierced his body.",

It was a no-go zone inhabited by many homeless people. There, he sees his friend attack two men carrying treasure. Gol D.\u0027s son Roger managed to grab it and lost his pursuers as they ran towards the forest. Luffy discreetly follows and discovers that Ace had an accomplice named Sabo. Garp\u0027s grandson eventually discovers their secret hideout, much to the panic of the two boys, who had no wish to associate with this young troublemaker who wasn\u0027t their age. But Luffy is suddenly captured by Porchemy, one of Bluejam\u0027s subordinates, a notorious pirate who wreaks havoc in the region. The young boy is tortured by his kidnapper into revealing Ace and Sabo\u0027s hideout, in order to recover the loot these two rascals had stolen from him. But Luffy stubbornly remains silent. Enraged, the pirate threatens to kill him. Just as he\u0027s about to do so, Ace and Sabo, aware of the danger Luffy is in, appear in Bluejam\u0027s lair to save their new friend.",

Makino tries to calm Dadan down by telling him that Luffy is very upset about his brother\u0027s death. When the mayor of Fuchsia, Hoop Slap, asks for news of the Straw Hat, Dadan, in a burst of pride, asserts that Luffy will never be defeated. Meanwhile, in the New World, Shanks the Red attends the funeral of Ace and Whitebeard, who are buried next to each other. The ceremony was so moving that the scarred pirate couldn\u0027t hide his tears, mourning the loss of his friends. After bidding them farewell, Shanks left the New World. At the same time, on Amazon Lily, Luffy is still reeling from his brother\u0027s death. Jinbe tries his best to comfort him, telling him not to blame Ace\u0027s actions. Furious, the Straw Hat tries to fight his friend, but the Fishman is stronger than he is and easily defeats him. Having regained his senses, Luffy listens attentively to Jinbe\u0027s wise words. Jinbe explained that he had to overcome his grief and that there were others waiting for him in this vast world. These words cheered Luffy up, and he immediately thought of the friends he wanted to see again.",

Far from being discouraged, the valiant swordsman wants to continue the fight, despite Mihawk\u0027s refusal. At the same time, in the Kingdom of Torino, Chopper is captured by a human tribe and tries to escape. But the little reindeer is stopped by giant birds. Thinking his last hour had come, he sees the tribe befriend the birds and Chopper is finally able to breathe. He then reads the newspaper and learns what had happened to Ace in Marineford. Meanwhile, on Weatheria, Nami continues to perfect her knowledge of meteorology and works hard to acquire new fighting techniques. She also reads the newspaper and realizes that something serious has happened during her absence. Meanwhile, on the Boyn Archipelago, Usopp has become obese despite the objections of his friend Heracles. Despite his enormous overweight, he learns what had happened at Navy Headquarters, and the news deeply upsets him. Not far away, in the Kingdom of Kamabakka, Sanji has become an okama. He waits for the sun to set so he can become himself again. He too receives the newspaper and is horrified to learn of Ace\u0027s disappearance. Meanwhile, Robin, still imprisoned at Tequila Wolf, decides to see her friends again, while Franky, after defeating a mechanical bear, has managed to unearth a small supply of cola. As he recharges his batteries, a fax machine starts working beside him, printing out the newspaper with the latest news on the Battle of Marineford. This information is also known to Brook, who is prostrate in his cage, where he has been locked up by the Long-Armed Tribe, and is stunned. As for Zoro, humiliated once again by another defeat against the baboons, he learns of the death of Luffy\u0027s brother from Mihawk.",

Meanwhile, Robin heads for Bartigo with members of the revolutionary army. She, too, is determined to become stronger. Usopp, meanwhile, is trying to lose weight and begins a strenuous workout with his friend Heracles, who tells him about the benefits of Pop Green, hostile plant seeds found in the Greenstone Forest on the Boyn Archipelago. At the same time, on the Isle of Sorrow, Zoro humbly asks Mihawk to train him in the art of swordsmanship, but Mihawk refuses. He changes his mind, however, when he learns that his guest has defeated all the baboons on the island, and is eager to become stronger for his captain. So the swordsman agrees to become his teacher. Perona soon learns from Zoro what exactly the strange inscription on Luffy\u0027s right arm means. The letters and numbers, 3D2Y, mean that the Straw Hat Crew\u0027s rendezvous will not take place in three days (THREE DAYS) as planned, but in two years (TWO YEARS). Zoro will take advantage of this time to perfect his sword-fighting skills by taking on the baboon chief, who has mastered all Mihawk\u0027s techniques by dint of having seen him in action.",

It\u0027s here that the Straw Hat will train hard for almost two years. Rayleigh teaches him that there are two types of Fluid: the Perceptive Fluid and the Combative Fluid. A third Fluid exists, but it is reserved for the most deserving. It\u0027s called the Royal Fluid. Knowing that he\u0027ll be spending many months on this island perfecting all his fighting techniques, Luffy deposits his precious hat and Rayleigh\u0027s Life Card in the only safe place on the island, then begins training alongside the other members of the Straw Hat Crew to grow stronger every day.",
