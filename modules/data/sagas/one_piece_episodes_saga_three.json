There, they meet two local inhabitants, Conis and Pagaya, who introduce them to local customs and objects, such as \u0022dials\u0022, a type of shell with various properties, and wavers, which enable them to navigate on the sea of clouds. However, an altercation with the local militia makes them realize that all is not well in this world: the inhabitants are, in fact, firmly ruled by a person who calls himself \u0022God\u0022 - the latter possessing certain supernatural powers such as the Mantra. Another problem is a warlike people called Shandia, whose land (Upper Yard) has been stolen by the sky dwellers. Their leader, Wiper, dreams of taking it back by force. Against this backdrop, Luffy and his friends decide to go and confront this God, who is in fact called Ener, leading to numerous battles between all the protagonists. In the end, Luffy manages to beat Ener thanks to a clear advantage: his rubber body is totally impervious to his opponent\u0027s lightning. The passage to these islands also provides an explanation of the mysterious City of Gold and the legend of Norland, evoked by Montblanc Cricket in the Jaya arc.",

However, an altercation with the local militia makes them realize that all is not well in this world: the inhabitants are, in fact, firmly ruled by a person who calls himself \u0022God\u0022 - the latter possessing certain supernatural powers such as the Mantra. Another problem is a warlike people called Shandia, whose land (Upper Yard) has been stolen by the sky dwellers. Their leader, Wiper, dreams of taking it back by force. Against this backdrop, Luffy and his friends decide to go and confront this God, who is in fact called Ener, leading to numerous battles between all the protagonists. In the end, Luffy manages to beat Ener thanks to a clear advantage: his rubber body is totally impervious to his opponent\u0027s lightning. The passage to these islands also provides an explanation of the mysterious City of Gold and the legend of Norland, evoked by Montblanc Cricket in the Jaya arc.",
