        "description": "Brook fondly remembers the circumstances in which he met the Laboon whale who, as a baby, began following his pirate ship around West Blue. Over time, the little cetacean befriended every member of the crew. But when the crew headed for the Grand Line, Brook and his captain had no choice but to leave the little whale behind, as the danger of the unknown sea was far too great for her. Leaving poor Laboon behind on Reverse Mountain, Brook and the rest of the Rumbar Pirate Crew promised to return and continue their adventure together, but unfortunately the pirates couldn\u0027t keep their promise to the poor little whale, who waited in vain for them for almost 50 years!",

Soon all the pirates were infected by the epidemic and succumbed one by one. Brook, who had taken command of the ship, decided to set course for the Florian Triangle, but the survivors were attacked by rival pirates who wiped them out by poisoning every last one of them.",
